She is not pushy. The book isn’t going to be negative — it’s a warm, witty, honoring book — unfortunately, the negative sing-song has gone round the world.\u0027Samantha has been both fawning and brutal with her comments about Meghan, depicting the Suits actress as opportunistic and calculating in interviews earlier this year before doing a complete about face over the past few months.Markle  has said nothing about her older sister.Doria met Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle on the set of the General Hospital when she was temping on the soap opera and he was working in the lighting department.They orced when Meghan was six and both parents spent a considerable amount of time with their daughter.Samantha and her brother Thomas Jr are the children of Thomas and his first wife Roslyn.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan faces backlash 7 000 mile private jet jaunt New York","story":"    Harry and Meghan (pictured in Australia last year) have spoken on environmental issues including climate change but the Duchess has been slammed for flying to the US by private jet          The cost of Meghan\u0027s New York baby shower and her decision to travel by private jet has been criticised on social mediaOn their trip to Australasia last year Prince Harry said: \u0027It is going to take every single one of us to stop the clock on the destruction of our planet, and time is not on our side.

So there are three Pauls! But luckily they all get along like a house on fire.\u0027Sarah says her new husband, an electrician she met at Gatwick Airport for the first time after meeting on Bumble, gets jealous if she even talks to another man because he\u0027s been cheated on before.She said: \u0027Paul doesn\u0027t know me yet, so it\u0027s a lot to expect for him to trust me straight away after what he\u0027s been through after his ex-fiancee left him. But it just adds to the stresses that we already face.\u0027I knew Paul was jealous and lacking in self-confidence before we met. But neither of us knew that this would be quite such an issue for him. As my therapist said it\u0027s something that would normally come out over the course of us dating before getting married, but we skipped that stage.  Now Sarah has revealed how two months on she and Paul are still together and living in the same house as two of her ex-boyfriends.

He certainly made the most of his proximity to the Labour deserters on the backbenches. Here was one photie-opportunity he wasn’t going to miss.Neither was the woman in the bottom left-hand corner. I’m assuming she’s SNP, too. Whoever she is, she couldn’t resist pulling a goofy face, like Bernie Winters sticking his head out of the curtain at the Glasgow Empire.Oh, no, there’s two of them!What made her think this was the time to play the Westminster village idiot?A few rows behind her sat the seven MPs who resigned the Labour whip on Monday, precipitating — so we are told — the greatest crisis in British politics since the Corn Laws. Or was it Suez? I really should pay more attention.Despite the magnitude of their treacherybravery (depending on your point of view) they were all smiles. The chap who looks like Inspector Morse’s boss, DCS Strange, and the bloke sitting next to him even went to the trouble of dressing in identical Man at C\u0026ampA suits, matching shirts and purple ties.(Perhaps they are rehearsing for the leading roles in The Mike And Bernie Winters Story, a new motion picture from the makers of Stan \u0026amp Ollie.)          Selfie taken by Luciana Berger and posted on her InstagramAnd what were the seven rebels all doing on this Momentous occasion, if you’ll pardon the pun?Posing for a ruddy selfie.Elsewhere, MPs were glued to their mobile phones, possibly anticipating this historic picture being live-streamed on Facebook or posted on Instagram, whatever that is.I don’t know about you, but I’ve always considered the use of mobiles in the Commons chamber to be not only the height of bad manners, but a gross dereliction of duty.They are supposed to be there to listen to speeches, to scrutinise legislation and debate the issues of the day. Instead, most MPs seem to be more interested in their own Twitter feeds. We don’t let schoolchildren play with phones in class, so why should members of Parliament be any different?Taking selfies in the chamber is only the latest depressing development. Is it any wonder that politicians have never been held in such low esteem?They always manage to make everything about them, no matter how much they like to pretend they are acting out of principle, in the national interest.Truth is, they’re all living in their own movie, as this revealing picture proves.When it was taken, and naturally stuck up on Twitter, the eighth Labour rebel, Joan Ryan, had yet to arrive.She was still making her way to the House in triumphant procession, arm-in-arm with the three Tory MPs who resigned this week — Soubry Loo, Heidi-Hi and Dr Wossname.They seemed to be channelling that famous Boots The Chemist commercial, music by Allen Toussaint and Ernie K Doe.Here Come The Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls!They looked like the political version of Posh, Shorty, Ginger, Scary and the little blonde job, only a couple of decades older. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Old Spice Girls.When they landed in the Commons, they made straight for their fellow revolutionaries on the backbenches, to be greeted with hugs, kisses, handshakes, high-fives and selfies all round.Whatever principled motives they claim for doing a Guy Fawkes on their respective parties, the celebrations stuck in the craw.          Luciana Berger catches sight of the camera and flashes a smileThey all seem to be enjoying the moment a little too much. As I wrote on Tuesday, with exception of the ubiquitous and ferociously ambitious Chucky Umunna, until now most people had no idea who any of them were.Apart, that is, from Soubry Loo, who shot to fame as a result of her increasingly deranged anti-Brexit act after the referendum went against her.Yesterday, she popped up as guest host on an LBC Radio phone-in, full of unwarranted self-righteousness and barking at anyone who dared to disagree with her. She even played the fem-card, accusing one male critic of ‘mansplaining’.So thrilled was she with the hectoring sound of her own voice, that she had to be reminded through her headphones by a producer to take an advert break.Don’t give up the day-job, pet. Sorry, I forgot. You just did.Look, I acknowledge absolutely that Luciana Berger had no option other than to quit over Labour’s disgusting, institutional anti-Semitism. And, yes, the other Labour MPs have legitimate grievances about the direction their party has taken.But the one thing they all have in common, and with the three Tories, is a fervent determination to stop Brexit, despite 17.4 million people voting to Leave. That’s what drives them and binds them together.These self-styled ‘rebels’ are rebelling against the very people they are paid to represent.Even those like me who think Mother Theresa’s risible ‘deal’ is a humiliating betrayal of historic proportions must reluctantly accept that we are going to have to swallow some fairly unpalatable compromises if we’re going to get out in one piece.Best hope now is that we can pick the bones out of it later.RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Chuka Umunna and his Labour rebels aren\u0027t the future, but by threatening Corbyn they might have just done us a favourRICHARD LITTLEJOHN: She\u0027s not the same little girl who ran away - and that\u0027s what worries me RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: It\u0027s anarchy in the UK classrooms as middle-class \u0027green\u0027 militants encourage children as young as nine to play truant RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: March against The Donald (that\u0027s Tusk, not Trump) and show the tinpot dictator exactly what the British people think of himGolf on the NHS?

Do they have any idea how this plays in the real world outside their hermetically sealed bubble? Probably not.They could do worse to listen to Positively 4th Street and heed the words of Bob Dylan.I wish that for just one time, you could stand inside my shoes.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro has ordered its sea and air borders with Curacao to be closed to block the aid.It is also resisting attempts by Maduro\u0027s rival, self-declared president Juan Guaido, to pass aid from Brazil and Colombia.\u0027Curacao is one of the most important points in terms of how difficult it is to operate at sea,\u0027 said Carlos Faria, one of the organizers of the aid effort on the island. \u0027It is risky but we are full of hope, valor and intelligence.\u0027          Angry Venezuelans shout and chant at border guards after being prevented from crossing over into Brazil          Maduro has closed the border with Brazil to prevent the entry of aid and the military has beefed up security at the Colombian border.

Branson, after being approached by Guaido, is bidding to raise $100million in donations through \u0027Venezuela Aid Live\u0027 on the Colombian side of Tienditas bridge.On the other side of the crossing, closed off with freight containers, President Nicolas Maduro will hold \u0027hands off Venezuela\u0027 - a three day festival.  Tensions are continuing to mount as the weekend approaches with Guaido adamant he will bring the supplies into the country on Saturday. The Tienditas bridge, is one of the conduits that he has targeted. Branson aims to raise $100 million in donations through his concert with big stars from the Spanish-speaking world scheduled to perform, and the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay vowing to attend.The government has not said who will perform on the Venezuela end of the bridge. That concert\u0027s slogan is \u0027Hands Off Venezuela.\u0027\u0027All the artists that are going to sing in Colombia must know that they are committing a crime. They are endorsing a military intervention,\u0027 said Maduro. On Thursday he ordered the closure of Venezuela\u0027s border with Brazil - one of the main potential avenues for aid delivery - as part of the power struggle with Guaido over bringing in aid. Maduro said he was considering closing the border with Colombia, too.Guaido meanwhile was travelling in a convoy of vehicles to personally pick up US aid being stockpiled on the Colombian border, defying Maduro\u0027s military to stop him.Recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries, he left the capital Caracas in a convoy of vehicles with tinted windows for the 560-mile trip.The 35-year-old leader of the Venezuelan legislature proclaimed himself acting president January 23 and wants to oust Maduro, set up a transitional government and hold new elections.

Yorkshire MP and Brexiteer Andrew Percy warned more extreme elements of the Conservative Party that their \u0027intransigence\u0027 towards Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plans could delay or stop the UK\u0027s departure from the EUBut the ERG hit back, warning that an ‘open-ended’ delay to Brexit would not aid the Prime Minister’s predicament.A source said: ‘An open-ended extension would not solve her problems, it would make them all happen at once.’Mr Percy, the MP for Brigg and Goole in Yorkshire said \u0027dozens\u0027 of Tories would be prepared to rebel in order to block the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.Now the PM faces a No Deal revolt: FOUR Cabinet ministers...Labour defectors are stooges of the Tory elite, says a key...‘The UK is about to crash out with no deal by ACCIDENT’:...Labour IS on the brink of backing a second Brexit...Share this article\u0027Some of my colleagues have got to recognise that the game they have thus far been playing with regards to this whole process is not going to end well for them and could potentially end with the delaying of - perhaps even no Brexit - which some of us have spent a lot of our parliamentary and political careers campaigning for,\u0027 he told the BBC\u0027s Today programme.The battle broke out as Theresa May prepared to meet European Council president Donald Tusk in Egypt on Sunday.Mrs May will have face-to-face talks with the former Polish prime minister on the sidelines of the EU-League of Arab States summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh, but Government sources have been keen to dampen talk of a \u0027deal in the desert\u0027.It is part of the latest round of talks between the two sides to break the Brexit deadlock in recent days.Mrs May and senior ministers like Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox visited Brussels this week.It comes as Labour was today hit by its ninth resignation over Corbyn\u0027s leadership.Ian Austin, Dudley North MP, whose adoptive father was Jewish, lashed out at anti-Semitism directed at MPs including Luciana Berger and Dame Margaret Hodge.He attacked the \u0027offence and distress\u0027 caused to Jewish people by the party under Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, telling his local Express and Star newspaper that he could not ask local people to make the opposition leader Prime Minister.He said: \u0027The Labour Party has been my life, so this has been the hardest decision I have ever had to take, but I have to be honest and the truth is that I have become ashamed of the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn.\u0027   As the clock ticks down to the UK\u0027s scheduled exit from the EU on March 29, the PM faces a rebellion by up to 100 Tory MPs who want her to delay Brexit if she cannot cut a deal, according to the Daily Telegraph.The newspaper reported that the BDG, which represents both Remain and Leave MPs, is calling for a free vote in the Commons next week on a backbench move to take no deal off the table.A letter sent on behalf of the group to chief whip Julian Smith states that many MPs are \u0027deeply troubled\u0027 at the prospect of a no deal, the Daily Telegraph says. But a well-placed source told the Guardian the move will challenge May to sack the rebels who have no intention of resigning voluntarily.  One cabinet Pro-Brexit MP told the paper if it came to the vote, May would have to get rid of rebellious ministers.\u0027It would be a huge mistake not to sack them. It would be effectively conceding we had lost control of the party,\u0027 they said.Former Tory leader Lord Howard today rejected calls for a delay to Brexit and insisted fears about a no-deal departure from the EU had been \u0027exaggerated\u0027.He told Today: \u0027Parliament delegated the decision on whether we should leave the EU to the electorate at large. People voted in unprecedented numbers, by a clear majority, to leave.\u0027We must leave, and I believe we must leave on March 29.\u0027Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond yesterday refused to rule out resigning over the issue, describing No Deal as an \u0027extremely bad\u0027 outcome he was working \u0027all day, every day\u0027 to prevent.   Four cabinet ministers are warning Mrs May against a No Deal Brexit.

Jeremy Corbyn has also been warned that dozens of MPs, including shadow ministers, will threaten to join the new Independent Group in parliament or resign if he doesn\u0027t back a second referendumThe Labour rebels are demanding Corybn supports an amendment by two of his backbench MPs that would put any deal Mrs May gets through to the public.The proposal stipulates that if the public voted against the government\u0027s deal, then the UK would be forced to scrap Brexit and remain in the EU.   One MP, who considered quitting the party this week, told The Times: \u0027If Jeremy ends up not supporting it, it will have a dramatic effect and people will go.\u0027  A senior Labour figure said that the plan, proposed by MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, was an \u0027acid test\u0027 of whether the Corbyn was sincere about not ruling out a second referendum. EXCLUSIVE: Ian Austin MP latest to quit ‘broken’ Labour Party | Express \u0026amp StarTheresa May must go in three months, cabinet ministers say | Politics | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Botswana set start culling elephants ban big game hunting lifted","story":"    African bush elephants may lose their protection from the 2014 law because of \u0027the need to control the population size\u0027 A committee appointed by President Mokgweetsi Masisi to review the  hunting ban handed a report on the matter to Masisi late on Thursday.A Botswanan government spokesperson said President Masisi was looking forward to reading the report and promised to take its recommendations into consideration.

Foreign artists at the biennial, a showcase for Cuban and Latin American art, will be asked to wear T-shirts showing their opposition to the measure and will be asked to mention it during their public appearances.Bruguera understands that the Cuban government is sensitive to bad press, especially at what should be its most important cultural event, which is why she hopes to subvert what she expects to be a “whitewashing” of Decree 349.The protests are part of a campaign by a group of artists and Bruguera, whose work occupies the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern in London until Sunday, against the decree, which was condemned by Amnesty International as “dystopian”. The proposed Decree 349 required artists to get a permit from the Cuban ministry of culture if they wanted to perform or operate in public or private spaces. It also allowed the government to shut down anything that it decided contained “sexist, vulgar or obscene language”.Bruguera says that since December when Decree 349 was due to be brought in – the government delayed it due to an international outcry – two Cuban rappers have since been detained along with a Cuban artist, Michael Osorno. She describes how Rafael Almanza, a writer who organises salon-style arts events in Camaguey, tried to hold a talk about Decree 349 but he was called at 4am by government agents and told he would be killed if he did so. Almanza confirmed to the  that he has received more than a dozen such calls since then, but no longer answers his phone.Such harassment is nothing new for dissidents, but what is happening for the first time in Bruguera’s lifetime is that the Cuban government is doing the same towards artists, she told the  on the phone from New York.“Now there is no way Cuba has independent art.” She says. “If you cannot do anything unless the ministry of culture gives you a permit, where is the independent art? It’s non-existent.”An unintended effect of the law is that for the first time in 60 years artists from all different disciplines are united in one thing – their opposition to Decree 349. Bruguera says: “People in Cuba are very savvy, they know the fact this new law is saying the government can enter into your house, there are no more private spaces at all in Cuba now.“The fact they can take your instrument, your goods, they know that all of these decision are not artistic, all of these decisions are completely political. What more do they want from us, how much more submissive do they want us to be? Before there was censorship, you could play around. Now you go to jail, now they take your house. It’s not a joke. There are no more games to play.”In the face of intense opposition, Cuba’s vice minister of culture Fernando Rojas backed down and said that art would only be banned in extreme cases, such as obscenity or racist content. He also began a nationwide consultation, but Bruguera says it was a sham and Rojas was only speaking to state-licensed artists, not independent artists like her.Bruguera says: “What we want is to eliminate the decree and work together to find regulations that are based on the needs of the artists and what will protect them, not only the government.”Bruguera last visited Cuba in late November and had planned to stay for a week. She ended up staying for two months to help with the fight against Decree 349 and passed up the chance to attend the Kochi Biennial in India. During her visit she was detained five times, each time for about 24 hours. One incarceration ended shortly after Tate director Maria Balshaw mentioned Bruguera was behind bars during a speech at the Turner Prize award ceremony in London.Bruguera was constantly followed and harassed on the phone, including one call she recorded. She gave a copy of the recording to the  and in it the interrogator tells her menacingly that she “would not want anything to happen to you”.The artist has a gallows humour about it and says that woman who spoke with her was “nicer than usual”. She added that the Cuban government “really want to look democratic and sound democratic but they have no idea what democracy is.”As Bruguera sees it, Decree 349 is a desperate attempt by the Cuban government to wrest back control it has lost since the spread of internet access. Cuba finally got 3G access through mobile phones in December, though it is too costly for most, but there are dozens of public wifi hotspots in parks.The internet has enabled film-makers to get movies out of the country without the permission of the ministry of culture and musicians have set up their own recording studios. Journalists and authors are sending their writings out of Cuba on their own and Decree 349 will not change that, Bruguera says. What will change is that artists will start to be “blackmailed” by the government.“People are going to continue doing things but they know it’s illegal.” She says. “Now the government has more control of the artists. Their tactics since the beginning of the revolution say: ‘I let you do that as long as you don’t go against me.’ It’s kind of a blackmail situation and it’s going to be used to separate artists, ‘you are the good artists and you are the bad artists’.”The Trump administration is unlikely to help matters as its threats to tighten the US embargo allow the Cuban government to paint America as the enemy. Bruguera says the U-turn from Barack Obama’s approach, which culminated in his visit to Havana in 2015 and led to former Cuban President Raúl Castro passing a number of reforms, would lead to stagnation.Having an aggressive America was “terrain the Cuban government knows”, she says, and that they “know how to cultivate the victim role”. Despite this she was careful about guessing what will happen in the coming months.“The one thing you learn about Cuba is to never predict anything because it never goes the way you predicted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/913e13aa641ee452e794bd988a089d56a200ee59/0_828_6086_3652/master/6086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27f67f2b4ef426dfd2de0a0a71114ef1","title":"art watchmaking craig rebecca struthers jewellery quarter birmingham pictures","story":"A master watchmaker and an antiquarian horologist at their family-run workshop in the heart of the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99374d0d66e5cae4c8aadda141970ee64472a21f/0_43_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f584c7ef10059917325f0d93ae2d1dd4","title":"campaigners condemn closure of rolls royce bribery inquiry","story":"SFO shuts down investigation into which executives were responsible for paymentsAnti-corruption campaigners have criticised prosecutors for closing a long-running investigation into the payment of multimillion-pound bribes by Rolls-Royce.The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced on Friday that it had shut down its investigation to establish which senior executives were responsible for paying huge bribes to secure export contracts for Rolls-Royce, without charging anyone.Two years ago, the multinational apologised and paid £671m in penalties after admitting large-scale bribery across three continents over three decades. However, the SFO continued investigating whether senior executives should be prosecuted.A leading judge had found that the “truly vast corrupt payments” had, on the face of it, implicated senior management. One of those whom the SFO had interviewed under caution was the former chief executive Sir John Rose. He had denied wrongdoing.Campaigners at the anti-corruption group Transparency International said the closure of the investigation meant justice had not been served.Robert Barrington, its executive director, said: “It is absurd that yet again a company can admit to bribery and yet neither the bribe payers nor the management team that allowed the crime to happen are held responsible. It is hard to believe that the interests of justice have been served or that there has been proper acknowledgement of the victims of the crime.”The SFO also announced on Friday that it was closing down another major investigation into alleged corruption, by Britain’s biggest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).Lisa Osofsky, the SFO’s director, said: “After an extensive and careful examination I have concluded that there is either insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction or it is not in the public interest to bring a prosecution in these cases.” She gave no further details of her decision.In January 2017, Rolls-Royce had agreed to pay the penalties after admitting it had systematically used intermediaries to pay bribes to foreign politicians and officials to secure export contracts.Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen’s bench ision of the high court, approved the terms of the agreement between Rolls-Royce and the SFO, which had been investigating for five years.Leveson had found what he called “egregious criminality over decades”, adding that some of it “implicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds” of Rolls-Royce.The multinational admitted paying bribes in Indonesia, Thailand, India, Nigeria, Malaysia, China and Russia between 1989 and 2013. An investigation by the  and the BBC reported in 2016 that Rolls-Royce had hired intermediaries to help it secure high-value contracts in at least 12 countries.Under the agreement reached with the SFO – known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) – Rolls-Royce admitted wrongdoing and submitted to various measures to monitor its conduct over a specified period, and in return avoided being prosecuted as a corporate body.Transparency International said that such DPAs were only successful when followed up with inidual prosecutions against those responsible for the wrongdoing.Barrington said: “This case is in danger of sending a message to companies that DPAs are a soft option for those engaging in serious corruption and that, at the right price, they can buy their way out of punishment, giving impunity to those who flagrantly broke the law.”Rolls-Royce reached similar agreements with prosecutors in the US and Brazil in 2017. In contrast to the UK, the US Department of Justice announced two years ago that it was prosecuting five iniduals for bribery, including two former Rolls-Royce executives.The SFO’s investigation into GSK started in 2014 and had centred on payments to Chinese doctors to use its drugs. The company had been earlier fined 3bn yuan (£342m) by Chinese authorities over the payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48434f9f1fbb774074ec3bbff2c26ff78cb530d8/0_129_4171_2503/master/4171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f67fbe2461050cc0730e5a159cfdb02a","title":"life cycle is it the end for britains dockless bike schemes","story":"Three major cycle-sharing companies have pulled out of Britain’s cities in just over a year. Can the schemes ever be sustainable?But in January, ofo followed oBike and Urbo to become the third dockless operator to withdraw from Britain in just over a year.New data gathered by Oliver O’Brien, an academic at UCL’s Consumer Data Research Centre, shows that the four major dockless operators covered an area of 617 sq km during the peak competition period in July 2018. Of those four, only Mobike remains, and its operating areas have shrunk, to a total of around 37sq km. Yobike operates a smaller dockless scheme in Bristol and Southampton which is not captured in the data.The most dramatic boom and bust was oBike, which put 1,300 bikes in London in July 2017, and withdrew them four months later. Wandsworth council impounded hundreds, complaining the bikes had appeared “without any warning”. In the absence of regulation, operators don’t need to consult councils before launching.It’s impossible to know the exact number of bikes on the streets. Operators are cagey because of high losses to vandalism and theft. In London, O’Brien’s latest count shows just over 2,100 bikes at the end of January, down from a peak of 5,800.But Joe Seal-Driver, a Trustee of CoMo UK, a trade body which represents shared mobility firms, says dockless isn’t dead.Steve Milton, Mobike’s head of growth and PR in Europe, said the company had learned to pick its battles. “Many cities across Europe want bike sharing, while others just put the shutters down.“Do we really want to fight that? Or do we just want to go where people actually want us? For 2019, our focus is building a sustainable business.”Can dockless ever be profitable and sustainable? Milton claims some European cities have already met a break-even target, but will not reveal which ones. Meanwhile Mobike is downsizing its fleets to “avoid an oversupply,” according to Chen Shaohui, the chief financial officer of parent company Meituan, which bought Mobike last April.Ofo shut its international ision last month, and has laid off thousands of staff. It is estimated to owe more than 1bn yuan (£114m) in deposits in East Asian markets.When ofo arrived in Sheffield this time last year, Douglas Johnson, a Green councillor, decided he was going to learn to cycle. “I never had a bike when I was a kid, so I thought it was a chance to get to grips with it”, he said.“There was a lot excitement about ofo. The bikes were simple to use, there was no cost to the taxpayer at all.”But with the excitement came the slew of local news reports about bikes dangling from trees and set alight for fun. Just six months later, ofo had removed all 2,000 bikes.“I was sad to see them go. But as I found out a bit more, it wasn’t simply because of the selfishness and destructiveness of Sheffield people, it was part of a bigger global restructure.”As a result of the restructure, Adam Rose, ofo’s former operations manager in Sheffield, was made redundant.“It was really exciting at the start,” Rose said. “It was was all about bringing other cities in, all about land grab.“But then suddenly that all changed. Bikes weren’t being delivered, there were cashflow issues, suppliers weren’t being paid”. Rose himself is still owed £6,000 in expenses and remains unemployed.Sheffield saw the most dizzying success and the most difficult setbacks. “It took all of London a year to hit the rider figures we got by our third week”, Rose said.“It was a big thing in Sheffield, despite the hills, despite the weather. People were raring for it.“Unfortunately we also had the highest vandalism and theft rates. I couldn’t say exactly how many bikes we lost, but it was certainly in the hundreds.”Rose can’t explain the exact reasons for the termination. “We just got told what to do by China, never why. We had to come up with our own assumptions and give our own stories to the staff on the ground.”Sheffield used to have a dock-based bike share system funded by the university and the council. When ofo arrived, that was no longer considered financially viable. The council and the university have no immediate plans to restart the system.In a number of London boroughs, dockless and dock-based bikeshare coexisted. Islington councillor Paul Convery said ofo and Mobike were able to cater to demand that wasn’t met by Transport for London’s Santander Cycles scheme, which is concentrated in the south of the borough.He believes there’s a happy medium. “Mobike and ofo had a crazy, buccaneering venture-capital ethos. They were burning through millions in start-up money.“TfL is the exact opposite, hugely over-cautious about spending, and it really suffers from that. That said, it is meticulously managed and has very high user satisfaction.”For now, Santander’s coverage in Islington remains limited. Ofo has withdrawn, and Mobike’s future is uncertain after its Memorandum of Understanding with the council has expired.Meanwhile, new dockless operators continue to enter the market. Lime, which has put electric bikes in US cities and across Europe, has just launched in Brent and Ealing, while Uber is considering launching its Jump e-bikes in the UK.“Everyone’s trying to be the Amazon of mobility”, said Katharine Butler, co-founder of bike start-up Freebike, in an interview with Yahoo. Mobike’s CTO Joe Xia has talked about the company’s ambitions to cover longer journeys, and even get into “flying cars”.But if the endgame of dockless bike companies is to become “multi-modal” platforms covering a range of different transport types, they’ve hit a bump in the road. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, who outsource costs by minimising fixed assets, the production and maintenance of a dockless bike fleet has proved hugely – often fatally – expensive.Nicole Badstuber, a researcher in urban transport governance at UCL, believes there is a future for dockless, but only if cities take the lead.“The current regulation is not fit for purpose. It treats bikes as clutter rather than as transport. Looking back, councils were on the back foot with dockless, they wanted to see how the market played out.“Our streets are public space, and local government should have powers to guide how companies are using that space. If we want to reduce congestion or see more active travel, cities need to take a more proactive role.”Badstuber cites Bologna, where the council has signed a contract with Mobike to provide its bikesharing service, as an example of close collaboration. In the UK, the Greater London Authority has proposed London-wide regulation of dockless operators, overseen by TfL.Despite the setbacks of the last year, Seal-Driver remains optimistic. “For every problem with bike sharing, there’s a technological solution”, he says.O’Brien proposes a mixture of better incentives for users to help with the onerous task of redistributing bikes, and heavier fines for negligent companies.But clever technological solutions are secondary to economic realities. Turning a profit on rides alone seems improbable when you factor in the costs of replacing vandalised and stolen bikes.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db530f46dec9a5b86514c81188fe9f914af13e90/0_263_4651_2790/master/4651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e6f21ab5383379676b5c4c0ab8adbf","title":"country needs tom hanks derek hatton heroes","story":"Derek Hatton, George Galloway, Chris Williamson, Ken Livingstone: these guys may not physically sit together in public life, but I definitely think of them as “a grouping”. In fact, it is perfectly possible that over time they could be joined by “like-minded iniduals” from the right. Galloway got on like a house on fire with Nigel Farage during the referendum. Unfortunately, both of them seem to have been pulled from the inferno unscathed.Yup, you can totally picture their independent minds dovetailing with disaffected #MeToo defendants or even defectors from the daytime schedules, such as Noel Edmonds. If things were different, they’d hang out more with their brother-from-another-mother Julian Assange. Like I said, it’s a mood it’s a feeling. They don’t have to share every view. Most of them will have an objection to paying the licence fee, say, while only some of them will get slightly aroused when they think about Marine A. Quite a lot of them, actually. And not just the obvious ones.Anyway, Monday kicked off with seven Labour MPs quitting the party to form the Independent Group – followed by another on Tuesday, three Tories on Wednesday, and Ian Austin on Friday (though he’s going it alone). So this week was always going to summon these bros-in-arms. It’s as if Gotham City’s Commissioner Gordon had sent up the Twatsignal.Deciding that the news meant Labour had finally done enough to warrant him rejoining the party, Galloway began doing the broadcast rounds in his black fedora. Not sure how up you are on your Galloway iconography, but the hat symbolises his troubadour spirit, and the fact he’s definitely going to act like a penis on the news. Wherever he lays his hat, that’s the place he’s going to act like a penis.On Wednesday, the hat was on Sky News, where its wearer judged that accusations of antisemitism in Labour are “pure Goebellian propaganda”. Mmmm. I don’t want to call bullshit on someone who wears his learning quite as heavily as Galloway, but falsely accusing people of antisemitism was arguably not one of the primary character notes of Joseph Goebbels. A notorious liar, yes. But picture the scene at the Berlin Sportpalast in 1943, when Goebbels made his most famous speech. Had Goebbels used the occasion to accuse anyone in the vicinity of antisemitism – falsely, I expect – I just don’t reckon that many Germans would have gone “yeah, classic Goebbels” or “man, that is such a totally Goebbels thing to do”.Given her effective constructive dismissal from the Labour party, then, some will have dared to dream when Luciana Berger stood up to launch the new grouping. Others will have regarded fellow splitter Angela Smith’s subsequent “funny tinge” comment as a reminder that it is best not to have dreams during this era of British politics, because they will get clubbed to death mere seconds after you’ve given birth to them.But many, many more will be able to enjoy this moment purely for the hilarious losing-of-the-shit it has inspired in hardcore Jeremy Corbyn tribalists. If this is what passes for playing it cool … I would recommend an intravenous course of Humphrey Bogart movies. Or some Katharine Hepburn. Just anyone, really, whose reaction to people doing what you’ve been screaming at them to do for three years wouldn’t have been to wet their pants in public while shrieking, “LOL I AM SO RELAXED LOL.”On the Tory side, similarly, who couldn’t love the detail that classy David Cameron sent identical “don’t go” texts to each of those splitters on the eve of their departure? Like so many readers, I am dying more every day for Cameron’s forthcoming book, believed to be a taut psychological thriller about a true-crime author who gradually begins to suspect himself of the grotesque acts he’s writing about.As for Corbyn, it’s good to see how fast the Labour leader can act when he genuinely minds about something. When it comes to all the Jew-hatred sloshing around, he’s been the friendly neighbourhood allotment holder who won’t be rushed. But when he’s really angry about a thing, like the defection of the watsisnames, he goes full Magneto. Except Magneto was Jewish, so … not Magneto.In terms of statesmanlike outreach, Corbyn’s pitch was a video in which he came off as peevish and irritated. The Labour leader’s retro glasses make him look like the guy in the corner at Nasa who’s going to say that the rescue mission can’t be done, because he’s got some charts that say it’s impossible. At that point, you want to get behind the guy who sweeps all the charts off the table, and says, “Damn the damn charts dammit – we are bringing Tom Hanks home.” I would then vote for Tom Hanks.Alas, it must be said the shortage of Tom Hanks types in British politics is now somewhat acute. Instead of leading men or women, all we seem to have is fighty extras. “I’m afraid I’ll fight from within until I’m the last one standing,” announced Johnny Mercer. (Just like he did in ’Nam.) Or perhaps you prefer Steven Woolfe, most famous for being laid out in Strasbourg, allegedly after a scrap with one of his fellow Ukip MEPs. Woolfe wants to stand against Tory defector Anna Soubry in Broxtowe – which is exactly where Corbyn himself has decided to head for a rally this Saturday. As Woolfe put it: “The independence of this country now demands the most muscular force to protect it.” Ooh! Diet Coke break, girls!If Brexit has long had the flavour of a fight in a pub car park, I guess this is what tipping-out time looks like. And yet, are all these self-styled hardmen the answer? As we head into Britain’s latest crunch week, it feels old hat, if you will, to put out yet another APB for something better. But here we are again, and here goes … Hanks-types: wanted. Leading men and women: wanted. Heroes: WANTED."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3ad022c56d29f4eb801356ca439a80719659df/0_118_2076_1245/master/2076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f395f4fd9724336727feb6f6aaf3f7d6","title":"malia obama rose shaming is the latest in drinking double standards","story":"Women consuming alcohol is a favourite of moralising tabloids and right-wingers, despite the fact that men are far more likely to drink to excessMalia Obama, a 20-year-old Harvard student who happens to be the daughter of a former US president, recently enjoyed a glass of poolside rosé during a weekend with friends in Miami. We know about this unremarkable incident because the Daily Mail saw fit to publish a salacious article about “underage Malia” drinking, consisting of 23 creepy photos of her in a swimsuit. They also threw in a video. The UK may no longer rule the world, but its tabloids remain global leaders in shamelessness.All right, Mr Wilkow, challenge accepted. I’m going to scream about “privilege”. More specifically, I’m going to scream about “drinking privilege” and how young women are judged more harshly than men when it comes to alcohol.Obama getting rosé-shamed by the Mail is not an isolated incident the media loves moralising about women and booze. A 2016 study by researchers at Glasgow University and Glasgow Caledonian University, for example, found women’s binge drinking is given more media coverage despite the fact that men are more likely to drink to excess. The study, which analysed 308 articles published over two years in seven UK national newspapers, noted that portrayals of women drinking were also unfairly stigmatising. Chris Patterson, from the public health sciences unit at the University of Glasgow, explained: “Media coverage of women’s binge drinking isn’t just about health or public disorder it also performs a moralising, paternalistic role, reflecting broader social expectations about women’s public behaviour.”While that study was about binge drinking, there is apparently no safe amount a woman can drink if she wants to avoid being judged. In 2016, for example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised all women of childbearing age who weren’t using birth control to completely avoid alcohol, in case they got pregnant. This condescending guidance was based on a CDC estimate that “approximately 3.3 million US women aged 15-44 years … were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during 2011-2013”. A study published last month in the journal Women’s Health Issues argues this was a massive overestimate, and cautioned that exaggerating the problem “can contribute to moral panic about alcohol use during pregnancy”.There is also, of course, no safe amount a woman can drink if she wants to avoid getting blamed for being raped. If you are a man, being drunk makes you somehow less culpable in society’s eyes for sexually assaulting someone it was the booze that did it, not you! If you are a woman, however, drinking means you were irresponsible you should have been more careful! Indeed, we seem to expend more energy telling women not to get drunk than we do telling men not to rape.One of the most glaring examples of our double standards around drinking is sitting on the US supreme court. In his testimony to the Senate judiciary committee last year, Brett Kavanaugh talked at length about how much drinking he had done at high school. “I liked beer,” Kavanaugh said. “I still like beer.” It’s very hard to imagine a woman telling a room full of senators how much she loved boozing and then getting rewarded with one of the most powerful jobs in the world. Kavanaugh got a pass, however, because boys will be boys, after all. And girls will be publicly shamed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43cd985e633248efc1f318c83f06a6f63196c470/0_297_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2db3ebe9d95697acb1f98cf714a2f242","title":"women karl lagerfeld chanel","story":"Karl Lagerfeld is dead, and the fashion industry he presided over from the house of Chanel rends its garments and calls itself heartbroken. His muse, a white cat called Choupette, which exists largely on Twitter – a metaphor for his misanthropy so pure I thank him – was photographed in a mourning veil, thanking us for our words of condolence. That his best beloved was literally inhuman, and very small, is no surprise. (It is rumoured that, if she exists, she will inherit his fortune, though that is illegal in France.)I do not think Lagerfeld really liked women. It is impossible to watch his work and think he did. It is impossible to watch his face – immobile, from surgery or not, I can’t say – and think he liked himself. It is obvious, and often noted, that fashion doesn’t have to be misogynistic and exclusionary fashion is merely expression, and expression is morally neutral. But it certainly became those things in the era when Lagerfeld was dominant. In a world that is pure hierarchy, he had the power of a medieval pope, and he could have used it to make fashion less exclusionary, and more joyful. Consider the changes that Edward Enninful is making at British Vogue. He employs Paris Lees, a trans woman, as a columnist, and his first cover featured Adwoa Aboah, a mixed-race woman. Lagerfeld was rarely so benevolent or brave: profit was his calling, and misogyny his method. At home, meanwhile, he preferred to idolise a cat.The couture shows in Paris, at which he excelled, power the global fashion machine and send it to the duller parts of Earth. He decided what was lovely and what was not, who should be noticed and who should be ignored. None of this would matter if it didn’t have that power – fashion, when cornered, cites its triviality as a defence – except it did. The machine sold perfumes and handbags (almost no one can afford couture, and that kind of money is a sickness in itself) by offering an ever-receding image of beauty that no normal woman could ever attain, let alone hold. The girls who wore his clothes, which were as insubstantial as a fleeting dream (he was an artist, and his works expressed his philosophy perfectly), were very young and tiny. They seemed, when you watched them, only just born, with no blemish on them, existing only for the adornment of Lagerfeld’s feathers and bows.There is nothing wrong with being young and lovely, but it is a passing moment in a woman’s life, and he offered nothing for women who do not look like that – ie, almost all women – but a remorseful look in the glass, and exile. He employed older women at Chanel (he had to, for models and cats cannot do everything), but they had to grasp backwards towards youth. Their faces were over-smooth and indistinct at the edges, as if they lived under a curse: a woman uneasy in her own face, a woman who cannot age. Young women – fresh clay for his myth – were what he craved. He placed women everywhere in unhappy competition with their childish selves, and I can think of nothing sadder or more destructive of the very soul that fashion is supposed to liberate. I imagine that had he seen a woman excrete, he would have vomited.It is worth noting, again, that he didn’t make the clothes himself and the clothes themselves were almost incidental to his art. Rather, he made powerful and spurious myths. The clothes were made by a group of dedicated, vastly skilled women (and a few gifted men) in an eyrie at the top of the house of Chanel. It is the same in almost every fashion house. You see these artisans credited fully only when a designer – John Galliano, for instance, or Lee Alexander McQueen – loses himself within the artifice he builds. Then they are celebrated, a small truth offered as penance for fashion’s crimes, and things return to the abnormal normal.Lagerfeld’s art had a wider impact even than inciting self-hatred in women for ordinary profit, and enchanting intelligent women to collude in it, which was always the most extraordinary montage that fashion offered. The world grew more unequal when Lagerfeld ruled fashion. That beauty – the very apex and definition of beauty – belonged only to the almost unimaginably rich added power to the gospel of prosperity theology that ruled the age, and which has brought us to such anger and terror. To the rich, everything, for they are fairies or gods and to the rest, the crumbs. He was, at his heart, a handmaiden to the unequal world we have made, and although you can argue for its transient loveliness, it was always uglier, and more important, than that."},{"url":null,"title":"jussie smollett trevor noah late night recap review","story":"Late-night hosts process Jussie Smollett’s arrest for allegedly staging a hate crime and review Trump’s obstructions of justiceJussie Smollett was arrested Thursday morning for disorderly conduct after he allegedly staged a hate crime, and by Thursday night, Trevor Noah was at a loss for words. “Are you kidding me?” he said on the Daily Show. Even more baffling, Chicago police said that the Empire star paid friends to stage the attack because he was dissatisfied with his salary. “This dude may have faked a hate crime just to get a raise?” Noah said bewildered. “What’s the logic there?”A fake hate crime is “not a good way to get a raise”, Noah continued. “I mean, call me old-fashioned, but whatever happened to just going into your boss’s office and blackmailing him with nudes?”Part of the intense response to the news stemmed from a disconnect between Smollett’s motive and the audacity of the staged attack. “This is such a petty reason to pull off such a major crime,” Noah observed. “Imagine if we found out the reason Tupac faked his own death was just to get out of a Blockbuster late fee.”Smollett has left a compelling trail of evidence, according to Chicago police, and he’ll likely to go to prison (the maximum sentence for his charge is three years). But he leaves behind a trail of damage.“Nobody won in this thing”, said Noah, though he found a small silver lining. “When this started out it was a story about people who hated Jussie Smollett because he was black and gay. But now, people hate him because he’s an asshole”.“In other words, they’re judging him on the content of his character, and not the color of his skin, and that, my friends, is progress”.Stephen Colbert also addressed the Jussie Smollett story on Thursday’s Late Show. “Now, this story involves race, sexuality, politics, and violence so I need to tread very lightly here and simply say: what a dick.”Some details in the case revealed by Chicago police were, indeed, bizarre and confounding, such as Smollett’s payment by check to two black men, Nigerian American brothers, to stage a hate crime on the night of 29 January.“Look, I’m no expert, but if you’re going to fake a white supremacist hate crime, hire two white guys,” Colbert joked. “This is one place where you don’t want ersity”.Jokes aside, Colbert acknowledged that the whole case “s just depressing ... It’s a horrible affront to actual victims of hate crimes”, even worse because “it’s done horribly”.There’s no good reason to damage trust in victims of real (and increasing) hate crimes by staging one, Colbert continued, but Smollett’s attempt to raise his salary through attention was “a particularly bad one”.“He staged a hate crime to boost his career? I mean, there are legitimate ways to do that”, Colbert said. “Has he never heard of a sex tape?”On Late Night, Seth Meyers reviewed a brief history of justice obstruction as reports circulated that Robert Mueller will deliver his two-year investigative report to the attorney general next week.How is the president preparing for this potentially bombshell document? Blame, deflection, tweets, arguing from the Oval Office for Space Force and border walls. “Space Force and borders. It’s pretty telling that despite the effects of climate change, gun violence, and inadequate healthcare, Trump thinks the biggest threats to America are asylum seekers and Klingons,” Meyers said.Trump has never been subtle about his attempts to thwart the Mueller investigation into Russia’s election meddling for further evidence, Meyers turned to recent interviews with former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, whose new book recounts Trump’s demands for loyalty and distrust of American intelligence. On one occasion, McCabe recounted, Trump openly said he trusted Putin’s claims about North Korea more than intelligence officials.“Say what you will about Trump – he might be a criminal, but at least he’s super obvious about it”, said Meyers. “It’s like if someone asked Barry Bonds if he wanted to take batting practice, and he said, ‘Not right now, I have to go take my steroids’”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f82dacc6d2887cea03c60601b21c8426637f41c/0_114_1832_1099/master/1832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ff3cd0bafe49e307d4ae424152bd7e","title":"boy 12 said to have created nuclear reaction in playroom lab","story":"Hobbyists say Jackson Oswalt of Tennessee is youngest person to achieve fusionAn American 14-year-old has reportedly become the youngest known person in the world to create a successful nuclear reaction.The Open Source Fusor Research Consortium, a hobbyist group, has recognised the achievement by Jackson Oswalt, from Memphis, Tennessee, when he was aged 12 in January 2018.“For those that haven’t seen my recent posts, it will come as a surprise that I would even consider believing I had achieved fusion,” Oswalt wrote on the Fusor.net forum.“Over the past month I have made an enormous amount of progress. I now have results that I believe to be worthy.”The enterprising teenager said he transformed an old playroom in his parents’ house into a nuclear laboratory with $10,000 (£7,700) worth of equipment that uses 50,000 volts of electricity to heat deuterium gas and fuse the nuclei to release energy.“The start of the process was just learning about what other people had done with their fusion reactors,” Jackson told Fox.“After that, I assembled a list of parts I needed. I got those parts off eBay primarily and then oftentimes the parts that I managed to scrounge off of eBay weren’t exactly what I needed. So I’d have to modify them to be able to do what I needed to do for my project.”His father, Chris Oswalt, who works at a medical equipment company, told USA Today: “I think there is a great disbelief until they actually see it.”However, scientists are likely to remain sceptical until Oswalt’s workings are subject to verification from an official organisation and are published in an academic journal.Still, the teenager may now have usurped the previous record holder, Taylor Wilson, who works in nuclear energy research after achieving fusion aged 14."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4102ee315eb44d4743cb4c05f9d247e703e8f5dd/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b69af74d8b7f071bb5451a1efc37","title":"early spring share your photographs and stories","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeAfter one of the hottest summers ever in 2018 and a mild winter across much of Europe, record temperatures are suggesting spring is once more beginning earlier than usual.Swallows and house martins have been spotted more than a month earlier than usual and temperatures are up to 20C higher than this time last year.

He said: “The current system teaches children to conform, not to question things. This conformity breeds the denial that is exacerbating the problems. What we need now is action. That’s what we have seen from children and students and that is now what we need from adults.”The protesters met at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and marched to the DfE offices on Great Smith Street. They blocked the road and heard speeches from Prof David Humphreys of the Open University, Dr Anne Andrews of the University of Cambridge and Dr Alison Green, the former deputy vice-chancellor of Arden College who recently organised a letter signed by more than 200 academics in support of the Youth 4 Climate Strike.The teachers and students performed a pantomime lesson, with mock chairs and desk, and heaps of chalk, to highlight the curriculum’s light coverage of a topic that will shape the lives of young people.The protesters claimed the UK government had failed to live up to the Paris agreement in which it pledged to enhance education on climate change. They said climate change was treated, at best, as a peripheral subject and that the weak emphasis on the topic meant some state students could go through all 11 years of compulsory education with just 10 classes on climate change out of a total of more than 10,000.“Sometimes I wonder, what’s the point of teaching when no one is teaching the truth about the future?” said Andrew Thompson, a 33-year-old teacher.Green said she was speaking on behalf of fellow academics in expressing solidarity with the student strikers. “Like them, I fear for the future of the planet,” she said. “Young people are striving at school to gain qualifications to fulfil personal goals and aspirations. They trust the government but the government is letting them down and squandering their future.”The DfE said climate change was included in the curriculum. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. He said: “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment all they will do is create extra work for teachers.”Many were inspired by students. Edmund Stubbs, a secondary school science teacher based in east London, wrote in the : “Seeing young people abandon their studies for a day and claim to be taking their future into their own hands should make any teacher uneasy and it has led me to question my role as a secondary school science teacher.”The demonstration is the latest in a wave of climate protests that are disrupting an increasingly wide range of locations and institutions.On Monday, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists held up traffic outside a London fashion event. In December, the BBC’s central London headquarters was put on lockdown after campaigners rallied outside to demand the national broadcaster declare a “climate and ecological emergency”.More than 100 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested in November when protesters blocked five London bridges and glued themselves to the doors of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. There have also been demonstrations outside the Scottish parliament and in the centre of Manchester.Extinction Rebellion, which started in the UK less than a year ago, now has groups in dozens of countries and plans to stage a week of disruption from 15 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095bc7256d328c9efd3dddf7474ccf179e14c0db/0_0_2953_1971/master/2953.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83ee2e12c548ea8be669147e1df3f9f9 2020w","title":"shatterhand 007 daniel craig james bond","story":"Judging by the cryptic name, Shatterhand could be an epic showdown between good and evil … or a German cowboy fableIf reports are to be believed, the next James Bond film – and the last to star Daniel Craig – will be called Shatterhand. Please allow me to be the first to suggest that its plot will involve 007 injuring himself in a botched DIY job.It’s a bold choice for a title. It feels nice to say out loud, arguably the closest that a James Bond film will ever come to being called Frangipane or Loony Tunes, which will be a comfort to anyone still stung by the red-hot shame of having to walk into a cinema and ask for a Quantum of Solace.But it isn’t entirely without meaning. It probably doesn’t count as a spoiler to tell you that Dr Guntram Shatterhand is a known alias of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, cropping up in You Only Live Twice. Although Blofeld escapes justice in that film, he dies at the end of the book on which it’s based. Bond strangles him, and then blows up his castle for good measure.From this we can infer that Shatterhand could well see the return of Christoph Waltz’s moodily underplayed Blofeld. It’ll be a man-on-man fight to the death, like Holmes and Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. It will be an epic, satisfying conclusion that draws on decades of character knowledge. It will be everything any Bond fan has ever wanted.Then again, Shatterhand was also the name of a 1991 Nintendo game about a robot policeman who goes around punching stuff until it explodes, so maybe it will be about that. The title also borrows from the Old Shatterhand series of German cowboy novels from the 1800s. So, putting everything together, it would seem to suggest that Shatterhand will be about James Bond lassoing Blofeld with a lederhosen and punching him until he pops. Which would make it a thousand times better than Spectre.Even if that isn’t the exact plot – in which case, more fool you, Sony – it’ll still be better than Spectre. Ever since GoldenEye in 1995, the Bond series has only been able to make one good film every two attempts. This has never been more pronounced than with Daniel Craig in tow of his four outings as Bond, the first and third were tremendous but the second and fourth might qualify as some of the series’ very worst. So Shatterhand could feature Craig rollerskating downhill with a bucketload of glass hands and still rank in the top half of his output.Better yet, we know that Eon, the production company behind the series, sticks to a winning formula when it comes to titles. Two decades ago, for example, it found some success with Bond films whose titles were bizarre death-fixated gibberish: Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies. In the 80s it went similarly murder-mad with A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill.So if Shatterhand is a success, then we know what the next few Bond films will be they’ll be named after a synonym for destruction and a part of the body. Perhaps next it’ll be Trashtoe, or Crackback, or Smashmouth. If this is the case, may I humbly suggest Batterbum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

But hear me out. Seeds are a powerhouse in my kitchen, adding depth to morning smoothies, richness to soups and even forming the base of creamy dressings. And they’re often cheaper than nuts: my staples are sunflower, pumpkin, sesame and poppy. I buy them in bulk bags, use some to make a seed butter (quickly roasted then blitzed - sometimes mixed with some nuts too - for a spread worthy of toast) I roast them with maple syrup, chilli and rosemary for these snacking seeds, perfect for sprinkling on salads, roast roots or simply for eating by the handful. But today’s seeded swede and onion bhajis have been my most recent success, dipped into a lip-smacking, creamy, sunflower seed raita.These are a great snack, but if you want to make a meal of them, wrap a couple in a chapati with lashings of the sunflower raita, some crunchy salad leaves and cucumber. The basic raita recipe (before adding the cucumber and mint) can be used like yoghurt in lots of recipes and dressings.For the raita125g toasted sunflower seeds1 thumb-sized knob ginger, peeled and chopped½ garlic clove, roughly chopped30ml sunflower or light olive oilSalt and black pepper½ cucumber, gratedExtra-virgin olive oil, to serveMint leaves, to serveFor the bhajis1 tsp nigella seeds2 tsp toasted sunflower seeds1 tsp toasted sesame seeds125g gram flourJuice ½ lemon½ tsp turmeric1 tbsp garam masala1 tsp salt1 large onion, coarsely grated½ swede, coarsely grated1 thumb-sized knob ginger, peeled and gratedSunflower oil, for fryingTo make the sunflower seed raita, blitz the sunflower seeds with the ginger and garlic until finely ground. Pour in the oil and blitz again, then add 300ml water to emulsify: you want the colour to lighten and for the consistency to be like that of thick Greek yoghurt. Add more water to loosen further, if necessary. Season well, then stir in the grated cucumber.In a large bowl, mix all the bhaji ingredients apart from the vegetables, ginger and frying oil. Add the veg and ginger to the bowl and briefly mix together with your hands.Pour 1cm of sunflower oil into a wide frying pan and heat it to 180C350F – measure the temperature with a digital thermometer, if you have one otherwise, the oil is ready when it turns a small piece of bread golden in 30 seconds. Form golf balls with the batter and drop them gently into the oil you may have to fry in batches, so check the temperature of the oil each time. Cook for about two minutes on each side, until dark golden, turning with two forks, then lift the bhajis out of the pan and drain on kitchen towel.Drizzle a little olive oil on the raita and sprinkle with the mint leaves. Scatter coriander over the bhajis and serve while they’re still warm (although they’re good cold, too).These are thoroughly addictive, and work well as a quick flavour boost to salads, wraps and sandwiches, or to top soups and stews.200g pumpkin seeds100g sunflower seeds2 tbsp linseeds3 tbsp white sesame seeds 2 tbsp maple syrup½ tsp flaked sea salt1 sprig fresh rosemary1 tsp chilli flakes, or to tasteHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.

Recent humiliating defeats by Manchester City and Bournemouth have eroded confidence in the Italian, who faces pivotal games against City in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final and Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday.Meek defeat in either of those matches is expected to result in the head coach’s sacking, with Holland believed to be Chelsea’s favoured option to take over for the remainder of the season, if he can be persuaded to combine his duties with the national team with those at the club. He would expect a prominent and hands-on role. The Football Association would need convincing that the 48-year-old could fulfil club and international roles simultaneously, as he did for the majority of the 2016-17 season following Gareth Southgate’s appointment as England manager.His departure to take up the role with the national setup in the summer of 2017 ended an eight-year association with Chelsea, from reserve and development level into the first-team coaching structure. He had also spent three years as Southgate’s assistant with the England Under-21s while working with the likes of José Mourinho and Guus Hiddink at the Premier League club. Holland attended Chelsea’s FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Manchester United on Monday as well as Thursday’s Europa League win over Malmö, and even watched the Uefa Youth League victory over Monaco at Cobham this week.Chelsea, who insist they have not held talks with any potential successors to Sarri, could point to the leeway they previously granted Holland to combine club and country duties should they open negotiations with the FA over a return. England play only twice more this season, in Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Montenegro late next month, before they begin preparations for the summer’s Nations League semi-final against the Netherlands in Portugal.Gianfranco Zola, who joined Sarri at Chelsea last summer, had been mooted as a possible caretaker manager to see the side through to the summer, if required. However, the 52-year-old has suffered complications after gallstone surgery of late, and has missed the team’s past two fixtures. There would be reservations within the setup, too, over his suitability to take up the coaching position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/618751833279ff38ff8b1bf8e7d2af91f1f49c7f/427_459_3034_1820/master/3034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37e00664e57e16b92985be543ebdadc8","title":"west ham v fulham premier league live","story":"45+3 mins: That’s the end of an often scrappy but nevertheless memorable first half. Fulham have been utterly abject for at least half an hour, but the way West Ham scored their equaliser means they can still consider themselves unfortunate to be trailing. I’ll be back in 10 minutes.45+1 mins: There’ll be a couple of minutes of stoppage time. They start with yet another attacking set-piece for West Ham, unconvincingly cleared.44 mins: I think Fulham might have a cunning strategy to wear out West Ham’s defenders by making them constantly come forward for set pieces. West Ham have had eight corners now, plus a smattering of free-kicks.42 mins: Nearly a third! Cresswell crosses well from the left flank, and Bryan clears ahead of a West Ham player preparing for a tap-in. Antonio comes close from the latest corner.Another corner, and another goal! There’s no quibbling about this one: a good delivery, a good run, a good leap and a good header at the near post!39 mins: Cheatcharito has the gumption to hit the ball into Nordveit’s arm and demand a handball decision.37 mins: Going back to the West Ham goal, the cheatery will handily deflect attention from Sergio Rico’s utterly useless attempt to flap clear. Had he done his job decently, the rest of it would never have happened.35 mins: The ball falls to Cheatcharito again, just inside the area this time, and he sidefoots a shot across goal and narrowly wide.33 mins: The referee couldn’t really be expected to see that, given his position, and his assistant was on the wrong side of the pitch to do so. I don’t think you can blame anyone for that except Cheatcharito.31 mins: That is absolute pure cheatery, no doubt about it. Hernandez fell over in the process of arming the ball over the line and stayed down long enough that he didn’t have to look anyone in the eye as he got to his feet.West Ham win another corner corner, their fifth. Rico comes out to punch clear but makes a massive hash of it, Antonio heads it back in, it flicks off Ogbonna and Hernandez turns it in with a combination of head and left arm at the far post!26 mins: “The standard of midweek Champion League games always brings mid-table Premier League games into sharp relief,” notes Paul Fitzgerald, as Antonio spears in another decent cross. This is certainly no classic, though Fulham will be delighted to be referred to as mid-table.23 mins: Antonio’s low cross is awkwardly pushed away to the edge of the area, where Zabaleta runs onto it. His shot is deflected wide off Serri.22 mins: Zabaleta goes down under Mitrovic’s perfectly fair challenge, and receives a textbook dismissive get-up gesture in return.19 mins: Meanwhile in Cardiff, Gerard Deulofeu has given Watford the lead. It’s 0-1 there.18 mins: Now Bryan, fouled by Antonio a couple of minutes ago, fouls Antonio. The wild momentum with which the game began has been quietened a bit because the referee keeps blowing his whistle.16 mins: Snodgrass chips a nice ball down the left flank for Felipe Anderson to run onto. Odoi however runs onto it quicker, and when the Brazilian pushes him out of the way wins a free kick.14 mins: Babel just executed one of the most dismal headers you’re ever likely to see in a game of professional football, accidentally nodding a just-cleared ball back into his own area. The defence clears again.12 mins: It is, I’m told, precisely 3,000 days since Babel’s last Premier League goal, scored in December 2010.11 mins: West Ham continue to press. Cresswell’s cross deflects behind, and it’s another corner. Babel heads this one away.8 mins: From the corner, West Ham win another corner. And from that corner, Diop heads six inches wide of the post, with Antonio sliding in but fractionally too late to turn it in!7 mins: West Ham have an attack, which ends with Hernandez being played in on the right side of Fulham’s penalty area, and his cross-shot being cleared for a corner.6 mins: A wild opening to the game, which is being played at great pace and with greater imprecision.4 mins: Zabaleta also plays a part in this, losing Sessegnon on Fulham’s left flank. Sessegnon immediately plays a low, hard cross into the six-yard box, and Babel turns it in!And he makes amends within seconds!1 min: Incredible miss! Zabaleta’s hopeless backpass releases Ryan Babel, who advances on the keeper, does a stepover or two and then passes the ball into his face!1 min: And they’re off! Mitrovic has the first kick, and Fulham promptly bosh the ball out of play on the left touchline.The players are out of the tunnel!The players are in the tunnel!Manuel Pellegrini has a chat, firstly about the impact of the two-week football-free break which ends tonight:There are positive things and negative. We tried to continue in the FA Cup but we couldn’t, so we could not play last week. On the other side I think we recovered seven or eight players who are playing all the games. I think Fulham have a very good team, they brought good players. The other games maybe they couldn’t win but they always create several options before they concede the first goal, so we have to play well if we want to win.He’s not under pressure. All the strikers want to score, but not because Marko is not playing. Marko has just arrived from some issues he had last month. Maybe they can work both of them together. Tonight we start with Javier but we have options.And on West Ham’s targets for the remainder of the season:First to win this game. After that we must try to win the next game. We don’t really have a target. That will be linked with the way we play every game.Here’s Claudio Ranieri on his team selection:We had to do something to try to win. We know it’s difficult. They have some good players. We have to score and I think with Sessegnon and Cairney we have good potential to score. We know we are in trouble, but we are positive. When I saw my players in training sessions, they are working so hard. The intention is good and we have to continue to try.It’s difficult but my players are strong. they want to fight, to survive. A win is very important for us. We have to continue, we have to think in a positive way, and I hope we can win.Schurrle has a virus, he says.So West Ham bring Zabaleta in for Fredericks, and Fulham make a trio of switches: Havard Nordveit makes his debut in defence against his former club, while Tom Cairney and Ryan Sessegnon are parachuted into midfield.The team news has landed, and this is it:A couple of months ago West Ham went to Craven Cottage and won their fourth Premier League match in a row, Felipe Anderson inspiring a 2-0 victory. The Hammers had six shots to Fulham’s 16, three on target to their opponents’ four, but they popped two in the onion bag and that’s all that counts.West Ham’s form is much less impressive now, with the last couple of months featuring one win in seven league games and FA Cup elimination at League One Wimbledon. Fulham have won two of their last seven in the league, but they were both at home (to Huddersfield and Brighton) and the latter is the only game played in 2019 that they haven’t lost, a list that also includes the visit of League Two Oldham in the Cup.So this represents a chance for both teams to get the ball of form and fortune rolling once again (or for the first time, in Fulham’s case).

What’s in his name?Last year, Mario died. The real Mario – the man after whom the character was named.Mario Segale was a real estate developer who rented space to Nintendo of America, headquartered in Seattle.The story goes that one day, a team at Nintendo was trying to figure out names for characters in Donkey Kong – including a certain small man wearing a red hat. As fate would have it, Segale walked into the room and into video game history. The mustachioed carpenter (he was only later employed as a plumber) got his name, and he has been stomping Goombas and racing go-karts ever since. While the character has acquired countless extra lives, Segale died last year at 84.And it seems he may have been the last thing standing in the way of dark times at Nintendo. Mere months after Mario’s death, an ominous figure has come to power in Seattle. Yesterday, Nintendo of America’s beloved boss, Reggie Fils-Aime, stepped down, to be replaced by a man named Bowser. As in Bowser, AKA King Koopa, Mario’s nemesis: the fire-breathing dragon lizard thing constantly kidnapping Princess Peach (nee Toadstool her English name has fluctuated over the years).He joins a slew of aptly named executives in the corporate world, including Zoe Hamburger, a marketing director at McDonalds, and the energy and sustainability manager at Tata Steel, Barry Rust.Laugh all you want, but to Nintendo fans, this is no joke. They quickly pointed out a disturbing photo on Twitter. The new president, Doug Bowser, had introduced himself to the world with a photo apparently taken in his office – in front of stuffed Mario and Luigi dolls who had been tied up like hostages.It’s like if someone named Dave Vader took over Lucasfilm while waving Luke Skywalker’s severed hand, or if Disney’s next CEO were named Ursula “the Scar” Jafar and tweeted a picture of Simba being trampled by wildebeests. But is it coincidence, or conspiracy?Before Bowser joined Nintendo, he was at the rival Electronic Arts, so he has every reason to want to take Nintendo down.Indeed, in the press release announcing his hiring, methinks he doth protest too much about not being evil. It specifically states that he is “no relation to the King Koopa and Mario’s longtime nemesis” and tries to comfort gamers by saying he “brings decades of experience, not fire breath, to new role”.It also claims he will play “a key role in driving national sales strategies to generate demand and achieve revenue objectives across all of Nintendo’s product lines”, which sounds exactly like something King Koopa would do.With Mario’s passing last year, what can be done to save Nintendo? After decades of playing Super Mario games, I have a few suggestions: first, threatened staffers should try either jumping over or running under the new president. Behind him there should be a button that causes the bridge to disappear and he’ll fall into lava and re-emerge as a comical skeleton. Alternatively, they can try grabbing his tail and spinning him around and around until he goes flying into a spiky bomb. If none of these options work, it’s time to find the real Luigi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c304e6fa18274d2bc5fe3c7c3568cd692af8ebb/0_99_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fd907e73f186f5f81838579cdfdc6e4","title":"struggling to sleep share your experiences","story":"If you have problems sleeping at night we’d like to hear from you is planning a new video project about sleep.We’re hoping to understand more about how people are affected by sleep problems and would like readers to tell us how they navigate sleepless nights.We want to include first-person video testimony from our readers.

Then, when the mercury drops, we’re somehow shocked that the sun is setting at 4pm, our monthly budgets are desperately contorting themselves around Christmas obligations, and we’re spending 20-30 minutes every weekday morning in silent negotiations with every instinct inside us that’s demanding we stay cocooned up in bed as the working day approaches.I’m one of those ungrateful types who says silly things like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by late August, which is testament to this annual amnesia. Sure enough, when winter comes around, I’m obsessively looking for any remnant of spring and summer to warm my spirit as I wait for the clocks to go forward again.Sunday is my day to fuel up on enough cosiness to see me through five days of early starts and pitch-black evenings, so all food, entertainment and activities must be warming and mellow. Cooking shakshuka for breakfast means I can let the stove’s heat wash over me (an alternative to using even more energy on central heating) as I impatiently watch my red sweet peppers soften in the wok, waiting for the perfect moment to add first the passata (I’m fussy about tomato chunks) and then the eggs. I eat hurriedly, using hunks of toasted sourdough bread as cutlery, racing to get the warmth in me before heading out into the chilly air.I don’t go far, as I’m lucky to live over the road from the epicentre of cosiness, Columbia Road flower market. The trees that line my street have been stripped bare by winter, so the market’s weekly bloom feels like walking back into May and June, even if I am balled up in a fleece and thick jogging bottoms. Strolling down the alleys that lead from the main road to the market, the sound of buskers singing blues music creeps up on me, accompanied by clinking pint glasses and pub chatter. To my right, windows framing candlelit cafe tables draw me in, leading my eyes to racks of 1970s tableware, costume jewellery and plant pots that spill out from a higgledy-piggledy shop and on to the wonky paving slabs.After I finally accept there isn’t a place in my house for a crystal glass decanter – a decision I re-examine every time I pass this shop – I join the crowded flow of bodies heading to the flowers. Towering bamboo overshadows us for a brief moment, giving way to a flurry of colour that feels psychedelically incongruous in the grey, dead January chill. I walk through, watching out for bewildered jack russells and small children, to soak up the sea of bottle-green house plants and flamboyant bromeliads, inevitable roses and hundreds more I can’t name – some that look like hummingbirds, some that look like pineapples (but aren’t), fussy ones that I’d likely kill in a week, and hardy types I could hopefully neglect without guilt. Then I loop back, looking for something to take home.My choice is slightly limited as I usually go towards the end of trading, when the lifestyle influencers have stopped taking photos and the sellers, eager to avoid lugging home too many spare cheese plants, offer discounts. By this point you can get a couple of really great bunches of flowers for a fiver, so I try to play florist and work out which colours and shapes are going to go together. Now it’s been winter for a good few months, I’m drawn to flowers that make me feel like I have the sun on my face – pretty little purple flowers that you’d see in a British park in summer, and sweet, warm orange petals that conjure up the taste of Soleros.While the flower market is full of life and colour, it is still winter, and I’m still cold. I timed my central heating to come on 20 minutes before I get in, so warm air greets me as I push the front door open with my bum, to avoid crushing my bouquets. I place the flowers on the kitchen side, and begin cutting the stems with inadequate scissors, the mixture of hard work and warm radiators bringing feeling back to my cold fingers. I make a feeble arrangement and stick them in a vase that I use because it belonged to my nan, despite its irritating tendency to tip over. They’ll live by the window, which looks out on marketgoers clutching their huge, leafy houseplants and marching home in single file like leafcutter ants in scarves and coats.Coffee made, slippers on and the house toasty, I squish myself into a corner of the sofa and get under a blanket that’s been warming on my radiator. As I lazily watch Netflix (or binge Beyoncé live performance videos on YouTube if I’m home alone or with sympathetic friends), I look up at my new bunch of flowers poking out from behind my TV. Their colours distract me from the grey skies and dull brick walls in the window behind them. I’m reminded that winter is temporary, the warm will return, and it will be so intoxicating I’ll say nonsense like “I can’t wait for winter, I love to layer!” by August again.To stay snug and cosy, download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck – you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

Those who were on social media for three hours or more daily were most likely to get to sleep late.Going to sleep late on school nights was a particular concern, researchers said, because it put teenagers at risk of “poorer academic and emotional outcomes”. Insufficient sleep in adolescence has been linked to a range of mental health problems, obesity and poor performance at school.According to the study, the heaviest social media users also woke most in the night, a problem that may be driven, or exacerbated, by teenagers’ sleep being disturbed by notifications and the temptation to continue online conversations into the early hours.Scientists at the University of Glasgow released the findings in a preliminary report that has yet to be peer reviewed and published in a journal. The report calls for support for young people to help them find a balance between social media and a good night’s rest, particularly on school nights.“With the majority of adolescents reporting insufficient sleep to function properly or to meet recommended guidelines, there is growing concern that social media may be a contributing factor for today’s teenagers,” the researchers write.Heather Woods, a psychologist at Glasgow, analysed data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative survey that aims to explore the impact of home life on child and adolescent development. The study focused on data from nearly 12,000 children aged 13 to 15 from across the UK.Those who hardly used social media were least likely to fall asleep late or oversleep in the morning, suggesting that minimal use was best for a good night’s rest.Similarly, the trend for the heaviest social media users to go to sleep late may be down to teenagers who naturally fall asleep late using social media in bed until they feel tired. But the activity may also drive sleep loss, particularly on school nights, when it has to be crammed into night-time hours, and when routine tasks such as homework get done later because people are busy checking social media.Holly Scott of the University of Glasgow, first author of the study, said: “We found that teenagers who spent more time using social media were more likely to fall asleep late on school nights. Although they also tended to wake up later, school start times meant they still were unlikely to get the hours of sleep they need on school nights.”Other experts also raised concerns. “Given that on school days, young people tend to wake up by 8am, those who fall asleep later are more likely to have experienced fewer hours of sleep, and there is clear evidence that lack of sleep is related to physical and psychological issues,” said Bob Patton, a lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Surrey. “The disturbed sleep experienced by those using social media for five or more hours a day will compound this further.”But Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the findings did not justify new restrictions on social media use. “The effects aren’t huge. A kid who is on Instagram for eight hours a day gets about half an hour less sleep than one who’s not using it,” he said. “This research is really good raw material for scientists to consider when we design studies, but it is not sufficient to change course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904876723ec9346f151184b5c96394a65d47f0a2/0_126_5130_3079/master/5130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cddc5243095f97c51d7395f8450d94f","title":"lets move cromer norfolk tom dyckhoff","story":"The crab, the pier, the fishermen’s cottages… but it’s a long way from anywhere but NorfolkWhat’s going for it?

We’re in a position to do something about this. And I spoke to Joe Coscarelli, who was one of the authors of the New York Times’s Ryan Adams report, and he said that, they sometimes lack the resources to do that kind of story, and most mainstream newspapers don’t consider music a news item. I thought, we have to be the people who consider these stories a news item and go after them.MW: What you’re saying, Laura, is exactly right. People slag off music journalism and say it’s not as good as it used to be, but for me, it’s better than it’s ever been and it’s getting to more people than ever before.MH: Our relationship, for example – there was a time when I said something wrong, just outright misinformed. I apologised for it publicly because I just said something that was a bit ignorant. Laura called me out on it and we had a dialogue behind closed doors about it. It seems that there’s part of this relationship where if you accept that if you’ve not done anything wrong, you’ve not got anything to be scared of, and you shouldn’t avoid criticism from those who have objectively different experiences than you do in things that probably you’ll be less informed on. What’s cool is that we’ve established this dialogue where we’re kinda like mates, but we’d hold each other accountable for stuff.MW: The other important thing that I wanted to say to you guys, Chris and Matty, is I think we need more musicians taking a stand and using their platform to get this message across. That doesn’t really happen enough, in my opinion.MH: Chris is the ultimate example of it.MW: Also you’re so eloquent when you talk, you have great ideas. They’re normal ideas that everybody really should have, but you put them across very, very openly. As do you, Matty.Chris: I think also the violence is systemic. As a musician myself, I encountered many, many, many moments of misogyny, also because some of the key technical places were occupied by men who couldn’t see me, for example, as a producer. My whole career is made of moments where I had to fight five times more than maybe a man to say, “Actually, I can use my own computer, actually I am writing the tracks and I can produce them.” I think it’s really exhausting when you’re a female trying to navigate in that reality, and I think sometimes it can be scary to take a stand, especially at first, when there were very few women talking about that, because then you’re immediately pinpointed as, “Ugh, she’s going to be the bitchy one who always opens her mouth.” And then you’re reduced again and you’re made to maybe shut up more. So I think that the great thing is that with more allies that can actually help make this a problem for everybody in the industry, not just women, it gets more and more comfortable to speak about those things because it becomes more a safe space for everybody to express themselves.MW: This is what I mean by the #MeToo thing happening in music – even if I look back to your original article, Laura, in 2015 that came out, that was a different world back then. Things have moved on, it seems like we’re in a better place now. We’re not there.MH: It so speaks volumes, doesn’t it, that everybody, woke Twitter, everybody gets together on this statement that’s very now and part of hopefully propping up some movement. But you’ve been saying this for four years!LS: I’ve been saying this for 10 years. Something I wrote about in that Ryan Adams piece: on one hand you’ve got #MeToo-related issues and you’ve got sexual harassment and direct examples of misogyny in the industry, but then you’ve got all the systems that prop it up. I was saying these things nine years ago in my first job, and they didn’t make me popular. You would point out that a bloke that we were potentially going to cover had a dodgy reputation, and you’d be the person in trouble. We would still continue to cover the guy, and you’d be more than in trouble.C: That’s the problem, also.LS: And the thing that I really worry about at the moment is, the Brits is patting itself on the back over the fact that it’s got 50-50 gender representation in its nominations and they seem to think that’s enough. But it’s not. If you look at the Brits last night, most of the women who were nominated, especially in singles categories, were guest vocalists on male producers’ songs. And you have Calvin Harris who’s winning best producer – in the entire 27-year history of that prize, only two women have ever been nominated for it and, obviously, they’ve never won. It’s great that we have representation and gender equality but we have to think about the behind-the-scenes roles and how women are actually being allowed to use their voices. Spotify has made it so that this trope of the male producer track with the female guest vocalist on it – that’s what pop music is now, and so it’s refashioned A\u0026ampR, and that’s what people want, it’s what labels want, it’s what female artists are being forced to do and it means that their voices are being heard, but they’re only ever an adjunct to men. It stifles creativity, and it’s demoralising, I think. For artists, I’m sure, as well as listeners.MH: And my point, also, is that women need to be listened to. If it requires men to say it outright, that that behaviour is not tolerated, then there you go. It’s not alright.C: It becomes everybody’s problem. It was great yesterday because of that. It was a real subject for everybody in the room, which was perfect, and the fact that you quoted the exact words of Laura was also respecting the original source of the voice, so it was the right thing. I think it felt right for many women in the room.• This conversation has been edited and abridged.• With thanks to Matt Wilkinson on Beats 1 on Apple’s Beats 1.

But along the way, she has exasperated just about every Tory MP.Those who know May well say that holding together the party she loves has been her guiding principle as she has navigated Brexit.Over and again, she has flatly refused to seek the cross-party consensus the EU27 had hoped to see emerge.Instead, she has focused on containing the contending forces on her own backbenches, believing the public didn’t vote for the “politicians’ Brexit” that would result if she tacked towards a Norway-style deal to bring more Labour votes on board.The former foreign secretary consistently tops polls of party members, but will have to get on the final shortlist of two from which they get to pick. He is less popular in Westminster than around the country, and moderate MPs will try to prevent him making the final round. There are questions over whether he can attract centre-ground voters. Johnson is the politician most associated with Brexit, and a hard Brexit at that.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 35Johnson’s replacement as foreign secretary was once seen as the ultimate safe pair of hands after his long stint at health. But his reputation took a serious knock at the party’s conference with an over-the-top comparison between the EU and the Soviet Union. An increasingly Eurosceptic party will remember Hunt supported remain in the referendum – and even briefly suggested the UK could negotiate a Norway-style Brexit deal, subject to a second referendum.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 45The work and pensions secretary has wasted little time on her return to government, a few months after quitting as home secretary over the Windrush scandal. A leading remainer in 2016, she has become the principal opponent of a no-deal Brexit, indicating she would support a backbench amendment to extend article 50 if Theresa May cannot get her deal through parliament. This may not endear her to Eurosceptics.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 35The home secretary has sought to demonstrate his credentials by espousing a law and order agenda. He has not been afraid to take on May, either, demanding the police make more use of stop-and-search powers. But while this may play well in Tory circles, Javid can push too far to the right: stripping Shamima Begum of her citizenship has damaged credibility among BAME voters.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 45The former Brexit secretary has courted the right of the party since he resigned last November, and hopes to position himself as an alternative to Johnson. Raab has the advantage of being a longstanding Brexiter. But his actions will be scrutinised, not least his comment in 2011 that feminists were “among the most obnoxious bigots”.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 15The energetic environment minister’s torpedoing of Johnson’s leadership campaign in 2016 has not been forgotten. But Gove has tried to be loyal since. While some have struggled under the weight of Brexit, Gove has sought to reboot his image by pushing centre-ground issues, with a war on plastics that has won praise from environmentalists.\u0026nbspPlausibility rating 25After the general election of 2017, when her majority was wiped out and George Osborne described her as a “dead woman walking”, she could have succumbed to the logic of the newly hung parliament and announced a change of tack.Instead, she ploughed doggedly on. Her allies argue that she could not have trusted Jeremy Corbyn to consistently deliver the bloc of supportive votes she needed to get a deal through.But she could have given parliament some role in setting the parameters, in the way she is now promising to do for the next stage of the Brexit negotiations.Instead, she scrupulously balanced Brexiters and remainers in her cabinet, spent months on an ultimately doomed attempt to keep Boris Johnson and David Davis on board and infuriated Brussels by endlessly declining to set out what future relationship Britain actually wanted.At one point the cabinet were so ided, they were sent off into breakout groups to work on the two rival approaches to post-Brexit customs checks.Like Corbyn, May can be tantalisingly inscrutable. Just as some Labour supporters fervently hoped Corbyn’s repeated professions of determination to honour the referendum result masked a secret desire to stop Brexit, a few moderate Tories continued to believe May was secretly a soft Brexiter, who would eventually succumb to the parliamentary logic and pivot to a customs union. But also like Corbyn, May is deeply tribal, and perhaps ultimately somewhat inflexible.The result has been a masterclass in ducking confrontation, changing the subject and running down the clock.Colleagues say the prime minister still retains a desire to leave her mark on domestic policy beyond Brexit, by returning to those “burning injustices” she spoke about in Downing Street.But even if the “three amigos” are not joined by more colleagues, the mistrust sown by May’s handling of Brexit, and her catastrophic campaign in 2017, means she’s unlikely to be given the chance.And the sad irony of her approach is that far from containing the warring factions in her party over Europe, she has overseen what is at best a splintering, but if the next few days and weeks go badly, could ultimately become a much wider split, in her party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113809b84f5ada7fb7b5e1309bf60bfa9e7cb9b7/463_0_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96dd59b84534c8cbdf8032c8801b5e6d","title":"michel barnier says there is high chance of accidental no deal brexit","story":"EU’s chief negotiator says UK needs to make faster decisions with deadline looming in five weeksMichel Barnier has said he is more concerned than ever after a week of talks with Theresa May and the British negotiators that has left Brussels fearing an accidental no-deal Brexit in five weeks .As the British prime minister heads to Egypt for an EU-Arab summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, the bloc’s chief negotiator publicly said he believed there remained “a chance” of ratifying the deal.But he told a French radio channel: “Today I am more worried than before” over the talks, adding that the UK needed to make decisions fast.The EU official also told ambassadors privately, after the negotiations with the UK’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and a visit by May to Brussels, that the chances of an “accidental” no-deal Brexit were high.Barnier said the UK’s attorney-general, Geoffrey Cox, was looking for a legal assurance in addition to the withdrawal agreement that could allow him to advise MPs, as the government’s chief legal adviser, that the Irish backstop would be only temporary.Cox wants to set out what conditions would need to be met for the backstop, if it were triggered, to be superseded by other arrangements, such as a technological fix. It is hoped this could be part of winning round MPs to May’s deal.The British side now privately admit that a timelimit or unilateral exit mechanism on the backstop will not be accepted by the EU.Barnier added that May had the option of threatening the Brexiters with an extension of article 50, and a delay to the 29 March Brexit day, to win them round to her deal, EU sources said.The Commons is expected to vote on an amendment next week on whether to force May to request an extension by mid-March if a deal is not agreed by MPs.But with the political situation in London volatile, the EU capitals have been warned by Barnier to be ready for the UK to crash out.“He is very concerned indeed – we are so close,” said one diplomat.May is to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, but both sides are playing down talk of a breakthrough.“There will be no deal in the desert,” a senior EU official said. Noting that the EU already had a full agenda for the summit and that at least four EU leaders were not expected to take part: the official said: “Even if we wanted to we couldn’t, but thirdly we don’t want to.”Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, on Friday described a no-deal scenario as a “lose lose lose” option for the EU, the UK and Ireland and a “major shock for the Irish economy”.He was commenting as the Irish government published omnibus emergency legislation on Friday on 15 areas that would be affected.“This special law enables us to mitigate against some of the worst effects of no deal by protecting citizens’ rights, security, and facilitating extra support for vulnerable businesses and employers,” said the prime minister, Leo Varadkar.The Irish government plans to fast-track the bill through Ireland’s parliament before Brexit day.Coveney said his “only desire” was “to see this legislation sit on the shelf” but that it had to be pushed through in the event of no deal happening by design or accident.He said it was extraordinary that with just 36 days to go, there was no clarity on what Britain wanted.The Irish government has already been in talks about EU emergency funding for vulnerable businesses, especially those in the agriculture and food sector.There is alarm over an announcement by the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, earlier this week that tariffs would be imposed on imports to protect British farmers.However , it is understood that generous quotas could apply to prevent a “shock” to prices and supply of beef and other products to the UK.The EU, which will impose tariffs at midnight on 29 March, under a no-deal scenario, has already had discussions with Ireland about emergency aid to compensate farmers for losses as a result of Brexit.Ireland has been to keen to avoid talking publicly about how it could opt out of mandatory EU checks on animal, food and plant-based products coming in from Northern Ireland, and Coveney was pressed on why the British would agree a “backstop 2.0” in a no -deal scenario.“That is a good question. In the context of a no-deal Brexit there are questions that will need answers,” he said.“The method to do that would be regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the republic, a position that is opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party which sees any regulator ergence between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a threat to the region’s place in the United Kingdom.”He said there would have to be emergency talks with the UK and the government would be sticking May to her promises.“The prime minister has come to Northern Ireland in the last few weeks and made commitments that she would do everything to ensure that we would not see return of borders of the past.”He said it was not credible to think that “all of a sudden” the Good Friday Agreement is worth nothing because there isn’t a deal on the broader issues of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69b1ba45602fecdde49ae57dabba244e4eecdf29/0_129_4022_2414/master/4022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b00adb2b4d006ac79ec5013c0b32851","title":"theresa may must go in three months cabinet ministers say","story":"Senior Conservatives to make clear PM should give way to new leader for next phase of BrexitCabinet ministers will make it clear they believe Theresa May should step down after the local elections in May and allow a new leader to deliver the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, the  understands.Senior figures in government have suggested they want the prime minister to leave shortly after the first phase of the Brexit negotiations finishes – or risk being defeated in a vote of no confidence at the end of the year.May wants to stay in place for long enough after Brexit to secure a political legacy beyond the fraught negotiations. But some ministers believe she should announce the timeline for her departure “on a high” after the local election results, paving the way for a Conservative leadership contest over the summer.Brexiters in the cabinet are keen to see a new leader take over for the next stage of the negotiations with the EU, which May has already pledged will involve more active involvement for politicians rather than advisers.The former foreign secretary consistently tops polls of party members, but will have to get on the final shortlist of two from which they get to pick.

Any extension to article 50 beyond 29 March would be likely to scupper the preferred timeline.May pledged to Conservative MPs before the confidence vote in December that she would stand aside before 2022, though later made it clear she intended to stand should there be a snap election.Cabinet ministers had hinted they would not like to see May take charge of the spending review later this year – which would set the direction of departmental spending until the next election.The prime minister has a year’s grace before another confidence vote could be called. Should she refuse to go this year, at least one cabinet minister has said they believe she would be ousted by another confidence vote if one were called at the end of the year. Her position could become untenable sooner if enough senior colleagues were to resign or publicly express their dissatisfaction with her leadership.Although Brexiters inside and outside of the cabinet, as well as former remainers who have now enthusiastically embraced leaving, believe new leadership is needed for the next phase of negotiations, it is unlikely that they will coalesce around a single candidate.Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt, as well as Boris Johnson, David Davis, and Dominic Raab are all likely to want to test their support bases among MPs, whereas Tories from the softer wing of the party are more likely to coalesce around one name, Amber Rudd. However, a Brexiter is likely to be far more popular with the membership.If a leader with the backing of the hard Brexit-supporting European Research Group were to take charge, there are concerns that MPs on the left of the party could defect to TIG.May is understood to have taken some convincing that she needed to pledge to step down in order to defeat the confidence vote held before Christmas and is keen to undertake a “domestic reset”.However, the legislation involved for parliament’s second session view makes it difficult for the prime minister to make significant changes, with much of the domestic agenda already announced, including May’s flagship legislation on domestic violence.The prime minister faces potential defeat in parliament next Wednesday, with scores of backbenchers and up to 25 ministers prepared to vote for an amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and aimed at securing an extension to article 50. May has promised to table a motion in the House of Commons on Wednesday – which MPs will be able to amend – if she has not been able to put a revised withdrawal agreement to parliament by then.She will fly to an EU-Middle East summit on Sunday, where she will hold bilateral meetings with senior figures including the European council president, Donald Tusk, as part of attempts to secure “legally binding” changes to the backstop.Downing Street said the prime minister had spoken to 26 of the EU’s 27 leaders in the past fortnight, as she tries to convince them to make changes she can sell to MPs.“She will have a period of engagement again, on Sunday, Monday, with EU leaders,” a spokesman for the prime minister said. “She has said it is not easy”.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox – whose legal advice on the backstop is critical to convincing Brexiters to support the deal – will return to Brussels on Monday, as technical talks between the two sides continue.Privately, though, senior government sources played down the likelihood of any deal being be reached in the next few days that May could put before MPs.A spokeswoman for May said: “We are working very hard to bring it back as soon as possible … Work is continuing at pace to achieve the changes we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00daf24cdd6296268fbafa3ea45d23e54a2cb52b/1_0_3700_2221/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f0ca2b2028148ebc5725f99d0fba75","title":"haris rauf pakistan cricket speed demon cinderella man","story":"The ballad of Haris Rauf is interesting to an English cricket fan. Mainly because it just couldn’t happen here at the momentGutted for Pitbull. It has been a hard week for the Miami-based chart ace, sport’s own king of the tournament opening ceremony. Pitbull was booked to perform at the opening of the Pakistan Super League at the Dubai Cricket Stadium last weekend.This was of course a hugely exciting prospect. As anyone who witnessed his set at the Brazil 2014 World Cup will be aware, Pitbull gives great opening ceremony, a style of performance that doesn’t really involve singing or rapping, but is more a matter of standing on a lighted plinth looking purposeful and occasionally pointing at things.Sadly there would be no reprise this time. Pitbull had to cancel after the plane he was due to board fell apart on the runway. But he did leave a message on social media thanking everyone for everything.And while no one would ever want to place Pitbull in danger, or take any pleasure from the image of a white-suited Pitbull plunging, parachute fluttering, still glazed and baffled behind his tinted specs, into the jagged terrain of the remote Kashmir mountains, the good news is that things went pretty well in his absence.The opening ceremony was excellent. Boney M filled the gap as headliners. A marching band in gold-trimmed jackets played a muzak arrangement of Europe’s The Final Countdown. And most important of all, the tournament has already found its first star, and in the best possible way.All hail Haris Rauf, sensation of the opening week of PSL3. Rauf had been a rumour until now, a raggedy 150kmh quick, a 23-year-old raised on tape-ball games and glimpsed briefly in the Abu Dhabi Cup doing horrible things to the toes of the South African Test player Heino Kuhn.We have been here before of course. It is a well-worn Pakistan cricket trope, the urban foundling wandering out of gully-cricket and straight on to our TV screens. We want this to be true, want Haris to be the real deal, a ready-made speed-demon blooming right up out of the soil, the kind of presence whose emergence chimes with so many things that are vital to Pakistan cricket and to our concept of sport generally.This is of course a bit of a myth in itself, and an unhelpful one, casting an air of noble primitivism on Pakistan cricket. In reality Rauf is hardly an urchin. He attended Islamabad University. But he fits the story in other ways. He’s naturally quick (148-150kmh on the gun). He’s also entirely self-taught, playing in the streets of Rawalpindi against the wishes of his strict-sounding family, walking the city whirling his arms, working out the mechanics of his own action.Eventually he turned up at the open “talent hunt” trials, bowled 92mph in the nets and was snapped up immediately by Lahore Qalandars. The moment of ignition came this week with a breakneck four-for against the Karachi Kings in Dubai.He looked the part too, ambling in off an easy run and sending down a mix of yorkers and lifters. His arms cross over as he bowls. He doesn’t really bound, but unwinds in a slingshot, pivoting his shoulders and then violently flexing his lower back. Let’s face it, he probably wouldn’t get through the Under-13s in this country bowling like that. We’d soon have him working on being lined up, protecting his hinges and bowling like a fast-medium mass-production humanoid.For now Haris has been told he can put on another 5kmh with a little tinkering. And if he’s still in one piece at the end of it he has an outside chance of making it to the World Cup in England, Pakistan’s latest Cinderella man.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsAt which point it is probably time to take a step back. A week in the life of a prodigy: these are excitable times. But then this is a story all sport loves to tell itself, a story about talent and opportunity and the health of nations.It’s there in the mythology of American baseball and in Australian cricket, with its deep attachment to those fond, happy sandy-haired figures out there in all that lush Australian green. It was there in English sport too during its own much mythologised Golden Age of cobble-street urchins and mine shafts crammed with World Cup winning centre-halves.This is a story of social mobility too, of sport as dream factory, there to scoop up and transform whatever blooms out of the soil. It is from this perspective the ballad of Haris Rauf is interesting to an English cricket fan. Mainly because it just couldn’t happen here.There are still exceptions. Tymal Mills didn’t play club cricket until he was 14. But really, we have no Raufs. If you’re not already playing age-group cricket by your early teenage years, well that’s you pretty much done. And if you don’t go to a private school you’re disproportionately unlikely to get that far.The summer game has spent a generation walling itself up in its own shrinking square of green, a sport that is invisible in the inner cities, that exists among the pre-converted or those with the means to break in.Where to go from here? For all the inanities of the ECB’s The Hundred competition – something invented by and for people who don’t actually like cricket at all – there is at least an element of outreach. People who barely know the game exists will see it happen. Buried within it is an idea that perhaps this is place that is open to talent, a place those from outside could aim to break into.It is the only direction worth travelling. For now, and for all the wider, next-level problems of Pakistan cricket, we can only marvel a little enviously at the story of the kid from nowhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be8cef76711750072d473eaf9905364b54d1d2f/0_66_2812_1688/master/2812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c2d2ea73a58903f54c3bb9446ba3cc","title":"kyle sinckler england wales","story":"When I look at Kyle Sinckler and how he is performing I see someone who typifies this current England team. Abrasive, dynamic and full of energy and enthusiasm. He may have what I would call his “odd moments” every now and again but I can live with that if you get the rest of the package and that is what we are now seeing.If you’re Wales you will probably look at Kyle and maybe Ellis Genge and think you can rough them up. But I also think Kyle and Ellis both know that. If you know you’re going to be targeted you should be able to deal with it. Wales will be targeting all of England’s key players or leaders for different reasons all across the park. Warren Gatland has come out and called Kyle a “timebomb” but Warren is someone who knows Kyle pretty well from the Lions tour and he is someone who has never let him down.I remember speaking to the England coaches a few years ago and their concern about Kyle was his scrummaging. It was almost a case of hopefully he can survive in the scrum and then bring everything else that he brings around the pitch. He’s not just surviving in the scrums any more, he’s causing huge problems for opponents there and really importantly it is not sapping his legs, it is not detracting from all the other stuff he loves doing. I saw him the other day and told him I’ve never seen him looking so big. His response was: “Well, I’m not going to get any taller …” That appetite for improvement sums him up.I’m thrilled with how he’s developed physically, mentally and tactically as a player. He has nailed down that tighthead position, even though he would never feel like that he’s forever wanting to stay hungry and improve. He comes across as vocal on the pitch, but that’s just him wherever he is. His energy is so infectious. He’s one of those guys where when he’s in the room, whether or not you can see him, you know he’s in the room. He’s like that in the gym. Sometimes he does it for effect because he knows it’s infectious and it gives energy to people around him.You see that with a few of the guys in the England team. You see it with Maro Itoje the way that he almost over-celebrates those little moments. That’s not because he needs to do that for himself, he knows that animation and those big gestures are infectious and it has that waterfall effect on everyone else. Kyle does that really well. If he’s making a big hit he celebrates just as much as everyone else. If Mark Wilson is making a turnover he’ll be the first to congratulate him with a pat on the back. He’s exactly the same in training, he’s exactly the same in the gym. To an extent he’ll probably be like that in meeting rooms – he’s just that kind of character who people like spending time with and being around.Kyle talks a lot about the work he has done with Adam Jones at Harlequins and it is a great dynamic. Adam would look at Kyle and think he can do all the things that Adam couldn’t. But then Kyle would have been looking at Adam thinking: I want to have your reputation, your mindset and consistency at the scrum.If you look back to the 2016 England tour of Australia, Kyle – and Ellis for that matter – was perhaps a surprise inclusion in the squad, Kyle wasn’t expecting to go out and play. Eddie just wanted him to go out and be part of the environment. Just sit back, understand and have a look – these are the levels that we train at, this is how we prepare, this is what Test match rugby is about.To cut your teeth in Australia, to be part of that environment as an active spectator, because he would have done all the training and helped the team prepare – I think that was a masterstroke. Just look at Kyle’s development year on year. In 2016 he was a spectator in Australia, in 2017 he became a Test Lion, in 2018 he made the No 3 jersey his own and this year he has completely established himself as a Test player. It has been an incredible journey.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsThere is a bit of the unknown going into this game because we haven’t seen this English side massively tested. That’s a huge compliment to this England defence in terms of stopping the opposition playing but Ireland just weren’t as sharp as expected and we all know what happened with France at Twickenham.Wales cannot rely on the crowd and the passion – they’ll get it in spades but it’s like a team relying on the wind in the second half to get them out of trouble – it will aid you but don’t ever rely it. England, meanwhile, have to turn the negativity that will come their way into something positive. When you’re in the middle of the pitch and you’re in your circle it’s just us, no one else is going to do it for you.Everyone they need to win this match is right there in that circle. That’s so empowering, looking around at the quality, eyeballing one another and where Wales may look to the crowd and rely on it a little bit, England will be insular and look within the circle.It’s interesting, Eddie has said this is the greatest Welsh side but Warren disagrees. Having said that, Warren has described this as the strongest Wales squad he has ever had and Eddie did the same about England at the start of the Six Nations. Emotion is going to be a massive factor. We will see the best side of Wales but if we also see the best side of England then they will win.Ugo Monye played for England, the British \u0026amp Irish Lions and Harlequins and is now a pundit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5bbf76f1c29759e27f85f0a988992f05e7edc24/0_0_3654_4445/master/3654.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07aa5836f5c1c1e13ec6f0b884426879 700w","title":"desus and mero viceland showtime tv","story":"From their podcast to a Viceland show and now to a major new Showtime slot, the outspoken pair have found a way to make late-night TV feel fresh againLast year, when Amazon broke the news that Long Island City in Queens would host its new headquarters, New Yorkers cried foul over the head-spinning tax breaks and the irreparable harm its corporate presence would do to the area’s cultural identity. Not quite so bothered were Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost, who first suggested that Queens would be the harmful influence on Amazon and not the other way round (cut to graphic of a package dressed in leopard-print clothing).Jost then added: “Only New Yorkers could complain about getting 25,000 new jobs. All the cities who lost out must be like, ‘Shut up, you whiny bitches.’ New York basically won the lottery and thought, ‘Well, the subways will be more crowded.’”Desus and Mero exist for anyone enraged by the tone-deafness of the former president of the Harvard Lampoon telling working-class New Yorkers to suck it up and deal. The Twitter loudmouths and Bronx natives known as Desus Nice and The Kid Mero don’t consider their new series on Showtime to be part of the late-night landscape, but if it quacks like one, goes out at 11pm, and lampoons the week in pop culture and politics, it’s probably a late-night duck. No need to fear the label, though Desus and Mero fill a much-needed vacuum in the culture of TV by being sane, regular human beings with roots in a world viewers can recognize. As they have said before, Desus and Mero are for the people.Thursday night’s revival, following the team’s acrimonious split from their previous network home of Viceland, began with a group of schoolchildren roasting the hosts in a pre-taped segment. The kids ask the questions Desus and Mero anticipate from the wider audience Showtime would ostensibly bring. Why must they wear hats indoors? Why do you have a TV show if they’re not really famous? Aren’t they kind of ghetto for TV? They answer in the same way they respond to anyone who claims not to “get” their oft-mentioned brand: those are your problems.The sizable viewership known as the Bodega hive – named after the Bodega Boys podcast that initially launched the pair’s career as must-listen commentators – intuitively understands their style, their language, and their ideology. This is, in no small part, because Desus is African American and Mero is Latino, identities that inform their comedy in meaningful, palpable ways. Like so many Americans outside the entertainment industry’s upper crust, they think of Barack Obama as a rich person first and a black person second. (Obama gets playfully raked over the coals for a recent, grandad-esque speech in which he denounced hip-hop’s material excesses while flanked by the “swaggerless” Steph Curry.)They cover the new propaganda video from Vladimir Putin, a viral ad from a soulless fentanyl company, and rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine’s snitch bargain without the setup-punchline structure endemic to late-night, instead freely riffing on a theme and following the laugh. Their technique has origins in sports-shouting programs like Pardon the Interruption and the 24-hour diss contest that is Twitter, where clowning has been elevated to an art form. On Viceland, Desus and Mero worked without any assistance from a writers’ room, and taking on Josh Gondelman as head writer for the show’s new incarnation hasn’t changed the foundation of their comedy. Aside from the occasional Photoshopped graphic, they’re not tinkering with the formula for success.As Desus and Mero continue to grow in a showbiz economy that sorely needs them, the challenge will be to not join the ranks of the rich and detached that they’ve always mocked. When the kids in the opening accuse Desus and Mero of being nobodies, they’re eager to point out that they can FaceTime with Nick Cannon whenever they want. They now face the same test as any artist pinning their sense of self on authenticity – of getting too big for their own good. But anyone with the temerity to question Desus and Mero’s ability to keep it real should consider themselves forewarned. They could very well be the next object of on-air ridicule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8069db6d586df6a4a45c5060f8862e8ab2cdae78/211_599_5658_3395/master/5658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50d505d82dac7049f48823e117e73323","title":"roma star yalitza aparicio hometown mexico success story oscars","story":"Residents of Tlaxiaco say Yalitza Aparicio, up for best actress at the Oscars this weekend, has given indigenous Mexicans renewed sense of prideA couple of young flautists are practising scales in a small windowless room at Tlaxiaco’s Casa de Cultura. The rest of the town band are rehearsing a competition routine with a troop of young folkloric dancers – including Yalitza Aparicio’s two younger brothers – in the grand courtyard, decorated with murals depicting the town’s pre-Hiic Mixtec warriors and artists.Aparicio is nominated for best actress at the Oscars, taking place on Sunday, for her astonishing portrayal of a nanny in Alfonso Cuarón’s acclaimed film  Roma. If successful, the 25-year-old Mexican, who worked as a teacher before she was discovered almost by accident at a casting call held at the cultural centre, will be the first indigenous winner of the award.The novice actor is up against established stars including Glenn Close and Lady Gaga. But in her home town, known formally as the Heroic City of Tlaxiaco in honour of a battle waged there during the 1862–67 French invasion of Mexico, Aparicio is already a hero.“Yalitza from Tlaxiaco in Hollywood, that’s just wow! She’s such an inspiration to me,” says 16-year-old Arleth Velasco, who was very excited about watching the Oscars ceremony on a big screen in the main square this weekend.Tlaxiaco is a bustling city of 60,000 people in the mountainous south-west state of Oaxaca, surrounded by small indigenous villages where Spanish is normally the second language. Aparicio is of mixed ancestry: her mother is Triqui and her father Mixteco. She had to learn Mixtec to play the role of Cleo, whose character is based on Cuarón’s nanny.“The film shows everyday life of our community, it is a reality that Mexicans who criticise Roma don’t want to accept,” says Velasco, referring to a racial slur used by a soap opera star to denigrate Aparicio. “Yalitza’s triumph shows that people like me with few resources, us ‘indios’, can be someone.”Aparicio’s unprecedented success has generated an outpouring of pride and joy in Mexico’s indigenous communities, which continue to suffer endemic rates of poverty and exclusion. Aparicio’s mother was employed as a domestic worker, her father a street vendor selling CDs. The modest family home, located up a hilly dirt road on the southern edge of town, is constructed of metal sheets, rocks and concrete blocks.“To see a Triqui sister in a film at this level gives pride and dignity to my ethnic group,” says Eduardo Gonzalez, a 42-year-old shoeshiner who said he had experienced racism. “I’m so happy that’s she nominated. It doesn’t matter if she wins, Yalitza’s where she’s meant to be.”Aparicio is the latest in a long line of artists to emerge from Tlaxiaco, including the Grammy winner Lila Downs and the cartoonist Héctor Ramírez Bolaños.“Art, music and dance is part of the community’s history,” says Miguel Angel Martinez, the cultural centre’s director. “Look at the murals of our ancestors, it’s in our genes. Now, Yalitza’s success has woken up an interest in young people for acting.”Martinez was approached in early 2016 by the film’s casting director, who was scouring communities looking for a young woman with dark eyes, black hair and dark brown skin. The casting agents came to Tlaxiaco because of the town’s participation in the famous Guelaguetza indigenous dance and cultural festival, held in the state capital, Oaxaca.A hundred or so young women turned up, and after three days the casting agents had 28 earmarked for a callback, but wanted two more. Martinez persuaded Edith Aparicio, a locally renowned singer, to audition. She in turn persuaded her sister, Yalitza, to join her.Yalitza, who had no intention of becoming an actor, wowed the casting agents. After three more auditions, she was offered the role. Cuarón has said  it took a couple of weeks to persuade her to take it.Some in Mexico have argued that Aparicio’s success was down to luck, but her brothers’ dance teacher disagrees. “This is a rare family, which without having any contact with the arts through their parents, has produced four artists,” says Uriel Aguilar. “All have natural born talent.”Javier Guerrero, the radio presenter who conducted the interview, thinks winning is a long shot against such stiff competition. “In our hearts we hope she wins, but whether they give or don’t give her the statue, to see her name and image on the screen is a huge success for her and this community. She’s a winner to us already.”The cultural centre is situated opposite an imposing 16th-century church on the edge of Tlaxiaco’s fir-lined main square, which bustles with musicians, salsa dancers and market stall vendors touting everything from traditional blouses to cream cakes and Aparicio’s favourite snack, chicharrón, topped with cream, cheese, cabbage, ham, tomatoes and salsa.She always stops by for a chicharrón fix, say the husband and wife vendors Jeronimo Ortiz and Rocio Reyes. They first met Aparicio when she was selling Christmas piñatas with her sister in the market. “She hasn’t changed at all, she’s a simple person,” says Reyes.Win or lose on Sunday, Aparicio appears destined for further stardom. There are rumours of a new project with the Mexican-American singer and actor Diego Boneta.“She’s an example to us all,” says Ariadna Fabiola, the director of the kindergarten where Aparicio taught until February last year. “You have to take risks and not worry about failing. Her life has completely changed, and we’re very proud of her.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3802078.1550776466!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paisley expects eu to pressure ireland to move aside in brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP MP for North Antrim Ian Paisley. File photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire. European leaders will soon put pressure on Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Government to “move aside” from the Brexit process so the EU and the UK can strike a deal, DUP MP Ian Paisley has suggested.The North Antrim MP said he believed that EU businesspeople and leaders such as German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron would now be anxious to achieve a deal that is mutually satisfactory to the EU and the UK.“If I was the German chancellor or the French president I would be saying to Mr Varadkar, ‘Listen mate, you have had enough fun with the politics of this it is now time to get on with the real deal’,” Mr Paisley told The . The Brexiteer MP was expanding on comments he made earlier this week to Russia Today in relation to Mr Varadkar’s insistence that there could be no change in the backstop designed to avoid a hard border, and that the EU was firmly behind him on this position.ShiftMr Paisley predicted there would be a shift to facilitate a deal. “This whole negotiation, frankly, for the last two years has been wrongheaded because it’s been pointed at a political arrangement to suit domestic Irish politics as opposed to looking at the greater good of a negotiation on trade that would suit everyone in Europe, ” he told RT UK .“Sooner or later, the Germans and the French and other member states will say to the Irish, ‘You’ve had a good enough run of messing about with your domestic politics. This is now frustrating us getting a deal with the United Kingdom. Move aside and let’s get that deal’.”Elaborating on those comments on Thursday, Mr Paisley said “the art of any deal is to give both sides the ability to walk away thinking they have got enough”. “That has to be surely on everyone’s radar at the moment that the European negotiators have to feel that not only have they given enough but that they have got enough to satisfy themselves and all their partners.”Awesome responsibilityHe added: “They have also got to appreciate that we have an awesome responsibility to satisfy 17.5 million people and their desire to leave the EU, and also to satisfy parliament’s desire not to have a backstop that locks Northern Ireland into something different forever.”Mr Paisley said that with the proper will “all the ingredients are there to make a deal” but as his colleagues had stated, it was also time “to dial down the rhetoric”.He said he was not being “pejorative” about Mr Varadkar “but that German industrialists and others are now bound to recognise that one thing that mainstay Europe wants out of Britain leaving is a good trade relationship with the fifth largest economy in the world”.“I think they are bound to now say, ‘OK Leo, you have had enough with the politics here, you’re people as much as our people now need a deal, let’s get on to that’.“If that sobers minds then hopefully we can get a trade deal and we can get this sorted.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: TwitterContingency plans are in place to recall Ministers travelling abroad for the St Patrick’s Day celebrations, in light of ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, the Taoiseach has said.But Mr Varadkar said he himself was making “quite a short trip” to Washington and Chicago and believed it was actually an important time to go.“We have put in place contingency planning to recall Ministers from overseas if we need to. We have a backup plan,” he said. “But the trip is going ahead. I think it is actually an important time to go to Washington, because we need to really make our case in Washington DC and we have some very strong supporters in Congress.”He said people in Washington had been saying very loudly and clearly that the US is opposed to a hard border on the island of Ireland and that support from the Irish caucus in Congress was very important.The Taoiseach was speaking in Co Sligo where he and Minister for Transport Shane Ross were turning the sod on a €150 million road upgrade between Castlebaldwin and Collooney, a stretch of roadway on which 30 people have died.The notorious 14km stretch where campaigners erected 30 white crosses to commemorate each life lost, has been likened to a graveyard. It will now be upgraded to dual carriageway standard. A second road project, the €18 million Western Distributor Road, which was also unveiled on Friday will open up access to the IDA’s new industrial park at Oakfield. Sligo county council’s chief executive Ciarán Hayes said the new projects would be “transformative” .Mr Varadkar said the project was really important because so many lives had been lost there.It was also because it was a key feature of Project Ireland 2040 and would open up Sligo for more investment, more jobs and increased population, he added.‘Bittersweet’Mr Ross said it was particularly important because of all the tragedies there. “The most important reason we are doing this is because we hope to save lives,” he added.The ceremony was attended by members of the N4 Action Group who have spent 15 years campaigning to have the road upgraded. “It’s a bittersweet day because we are thinking of all those who died on that stretch of road,” said spokesman Bernard Mulhern.Asked if he was more or less optimistic about the Brexit negotiations following this week’s turmoil in British politics, the Taoiseach said: “I suppose I am no more nor less optimistic. Part of the problem for the last two years is that British politics has been negotiating among themselves. They made a decision to leave the EU, we respect that decision but it is more and more evident that there was not a consensus on what Brexit would really mean”. He said this had made negotiations difficult .“I think it is evident to everyone that the political situation in the UK and Westminster is very unstable,” he said. “Both of the main parties, the Conservatives and Labour are losing MPs and there may be more in the days ahead”.The Taoiseach added: “The lack of political stability, the lack of certainty, the ision in Westminster makes the situation very difficult.” But he said Ireland was very much sticking by its position, defending the withdrawal agreement, the protocol on Ireland, and also the backstop which is in that. He said the legislation on Brexit published by the Tánaiste on Friday was really important preparing us “as much as we can to mitigate some of the harms from a no-deal Brexit that may occur at the end of March”. He said it was designed to ensure that citizens rights were protected around healthcare, around education, while giving additional powers to support and intervene and back businesses which may be vulnerable in the event of no deal. PrepareQuestioned about the likelihood of the legislation being passed on time, the Taoiseach said the Omnibus Brexit Bill required the co-operation of the Opposition parties “but in fairness to the vast majority of the Opposition they have been co-operative to date on issues such as this”. He said the legislation was about making sure we protect the Common Travel Area so people can continue to travel freely between Britain and Ireland, about protecting the right to work in Britain and Ireland, and protecting people’s student grants, their welfare and pension entitlements, and giving extra powers to detain criminals that are wanted in the UK. “So I can’t imagine why anyone would be against this legislation or would try to hold it up.”Mr Varadkar said his preference would be to see a withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol ratified by the European Council meeting on March 22nd.

Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesSenior members of British prime minister Theresa May’s cabinet want her to step down after the local elections in May and allow a new leader to deliver the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, it has been reported.Leading ministers have suggested they want the prime minister to leave shortly after the first phase of the Brexit negotiations finishes – or risk being defeated in a vote of no confidence at the end of the year.Mrs May wants to stay in place for long enough after Brexit to secure a political legacy beyond the negotiations. But some ministers believe she should announce the timeline for her departure “on a high” after the local election results, paving the way for a Conservative leadership contest over the summer.Brexiteers in her cabinet are keen to see a new leader take over for the next stage of the negotiations with the EU, which Mrs May has already pledged will involve more active involvement for politicians rather than advisers.The hardening mood among cabinet ministers on the timeline for her departure will place further pressure on Mrs May before a critical week of Brexit talks and votes amid a febrile climate in Westminster.Ministers who want her to go are confident that if Brexit can be delivered on time on March 29th, the party should be able to secure some promising results in the local elections that would provide a face-saving context for her early departure.Year’s graceMrs May pledged to Conservative MPs before the confidence vote in December that she would stand aside before 2022, though later made it clear she intended to stand should there be a snap election.The prime minister has a year’s grace before another confidence vote could be called. Should she refuse to go this year, at least one cabinet minister has said they believe she would be ousted by another confidence vote if one were called at the end of the year.Her position could become untenable sooner if enough senior colleagues were to resign or publicly express their dissatisfaction with her leadership.Although Brexiteers inside and outside of the cabinet, as well as former remainers who have now embraced leaving, believe new leadership is needed for the next phase of negotiations, it is unlikely they will coalesce around a single candidate.Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt, as well as Boris Johnson, David Davis and Dominic Raab are all likely to want to test their support bases among MPs, whereas Tories from the softer wing of the party are more likely to coalesce around one name, Amber Rudd. However, a Brexiteer is likely to be far more popular with the membership. –  News and Media"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3803270.1550867641!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit is a lose lose lose says coveney","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney at the publication of no-deal Brexit legislation. Photograph: Nick BradshawA disorderly Brexit would be a “lose, lose, lose” for the UK, the EU and Ireland, Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned as he published emergency legislation to prepare for such a scenario.The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he hoped the Government would “never have to use” the omnibus Bill, which covers citizens’ rights and supports businesses, jobs, healthcare, transport, education and energy.The Government’s preference is for the withdrawal deal, which has been rejected by the House of Commons, to be ratified.“My only desire is to see this legislation sit on the shelf,” said Mr Coveney.The country potentially faces “an emergency situation,” he said, and that the new legislation was “the most important thing” the Government needs to do between now and the end of March when the UK leaves the EU.The Tánaiste told reporters that a hard Brexit would be “a major shock” to the economies of EU member states, “none more so than the UK”.The UK could still avoid it, he added. “Westminster remains the only place that can take a no-deal Brexit off the table.”Mr Coveney said the legislation intended to maintain “the things that work so well today”.“We cannot offset all of the damage that it will do but we are doing everything we can through legislation, through preparation, through investment, through information and through support of the multiple sectors and the multiple numbers of people that will be impacted by that worst-case scenario.”Hard borderThe landmark legislation, which runs to 70 pages, is aimed at protecting Irish citizens, supporting businesses and jobs and securing continued access to essential services and products.The Government hopes to have the legislation ready to be passed by the middle of March. The Bill will be debated in the Dáil next week and then before parliamentary committees the following week.Mr Coveney told a press conference in Dublin he believed a hard border could be avoided in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit through North-South “regulatory alignment, if no other mechanism works”.He said he hoped this would result in farmers in Northern Ireland being given “preferential treatment” so that it does not result in the imposition of tariffs or any food and animal health checks on the cross-Border trade.“That is doable we do it today,” he said. “Even within the European Union, Northern Ireland from an animal health perspective has been treated as an all-island responsibility.”‘Really extraordinary’The single omnibus Bill comprises 15 parts relating to matters within the remits of nine Government Ministers.Mr Coveney said it was “still too early to say” how much financial support would be provided to companies affected by a no-deal Brexit.“Until we know – or have more detail about what a no-deal Brexit looks like from a British perspective, in the context of trading environment as regards the application of tariffs or not, then it is hard to anticipate what this might cost to support a business, to allow them to survive through a very difficult transition period,” he said.He described it as “really extraordinary”, with 35 days until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29th, that “we don’t have clarity” around that.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It also called for “regular but limited” elephant culling. It suggested meat from culled animals could be canned for pet food. We recommend ... a legal framework that will enable the growth of a safari hunting industry and manage the country\u0027s elephant population within the historic range, said Frans Van Der Westhuizen, who chaired the committee. President Masisi said he would present the report to his cabinet before making a decision. . A white paper will follow and it will be shared with the public, he told the BBC.The decision comes amid growing tensions between Mr Masisi and Mr Khama, who stepped down last year. Mr Masisi has pursued several policies seen as dismantling his predecessor\u0027s legacy. Mr Khama, a champion of conservation, publicly criticised Mr Masisi for disarming wildlife rangers last year after conservationists said they had found evidence of a surge of elephant poaching.The Botswanan government has denied poaching is on the increase in the country. Charlie Mayhew, CEO of Tusk, the Duke of Cambridge\u0027s conservation charity, said Botswana\u0027s decision to review the hunting ban a huge disappointment.It flies in the face of international efforts, including their own leadership of the Elephant Protections Initiative, to protest so many other populations that have been decimated by poaching across Africa, he said.  I am sure many people and visitors to Botswana will be horrified.Conservationists are ided on the justification for big game hunting, however.While some say it contributes to species loss, others argue it creates an economic incentive for rural populations to protect their local wildlife from poachers. Elephants have few natural predators to control their numbers. An elephant conservationist who works with the Botswanan government called the suggested cull and hunting short sighted.Botswana does have too many elephants, and there is huge elephant human conflict, said the conservationist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But this is not economically viable and it doesn\u0027t take into account the reputational damage to the country. Better exploitation of sustainable tourism is a far better model. The announcement came as Zambia’s government said it would push ahead with a controversial cull of hippos on the Luangwa river.  Tourism Permanent Secretary Howard Sikwela told Reuters that the cull would begin when the hunting season opens in May. Zambia says its population of 12,200 hippos is unsustainable given the water levels of the river and that they present an anthrax risk. It wants to kill up to 2000 of the animals over the next five years, despite opposition from environmentalists. Howard Jones, CEO of the Born Free Foundation, called the decision to go ahead with the cull “extraordinary, perverse and grotesque.”Ian Austin MP quits \u0026#39broken\u0026#39 Labour Party after becoming \u0026#39ashamed\u0026#39 of Jeremy Corbyn Michael Jackson estate sues HBO for $100 million over Leaving Neverland documentaryComment: Brexiteers must now hold their nerve against Remain\u0026#39s desperate last standBrexit latest news: Theresa May must quit in three months, cabinet ministers warnCheshire Police found guilty of discrimination after rejecting white heterosexual man for jobRoyal Navy warship seizes £9m of heroin during Gulf patrolJihadi Jack, the Briton accused of fighting for Isil: \u0026#39I miss my mum, pasties and Doctor Who - I want to go home\u0026#39I took on a tiger at tug-of-war... and lostComment: It\u0026#39s the Left\u0026#39s fault we can\u0026#39t try Begum in BritainWife of Stannah Stairlifts MD spared jail after killing motorcyclist during school runIndian Supreme Court orders eviction of 1 million tribal forest dwellersItalian MPs demand explanation from Matteo Salvini over claims his party sought funding from RussiaCouncillor who moved 400 miles away from ward to quit one role as he is confronted at new homeAustralian man jailed for life over Melbourne car rampage that killed sixEmpire executives suspend Jussie Smollett and say his character Jamal will not appear in final two episodesEmpire actor Jussie Smollett’s ‘faked’ racial attack: what really happened?Time\u0026#39s Up chief resigns after assault allegation against her sonPensioner claims his privacy has been invaded by neighbour\u0026#39s children bouncing on trampolineIndigenous woman shot dead, a dozen injured, in border clashes with Venezuelan security forces\u0026#39There will be no election for me\u0026#39: Week-long delay leaves many Nigerian voters in wrong place to cast their ballotWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 22 february 2019","story":"An 11-foot structure created using 168,000 to highlight the world\u0027s plastic waste problem.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard’s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero.The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who’d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn\u0027t one of them.Courtesy of BFINicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history.  Richard Kelly’s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest.1047 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)It wouldn’t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy.

Leaders of retail bodies said reverting to World Trade Organisation tariffs could make the cost of making fresh food and drink available to consumers increase by as much as 45 per cent – which is likely to be passed on to customers. The warning comes days after Birds Eye boss Wayne Hudson said food prices were likely to rise by up to 20 per cent “virtually immediately”\u0026nbspdue to new tariffs.Food and drink production will be made more expensive due to a combination of higher tariffs and new regulatory checks, according to Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Thomas Burke, director of Retail Ireland and William Bain, the British Retail Consortium Europe and international policy adviser.Mr Bain said people in Great Britain will see the price of goods from Ireland and Northern Ireland rise.“Our supply chains are highly integrated, with food ingredients coming from both Ireland and the EU, and 60 per cent of the £2bn of Northern Ireland agri-food bound for Great Britain crosses the Irish sea via Dublin,” he said.Created with Sketch.

A no-deal Brexit will hit us first and hit us hardest. This is not acceptable.”“A hard Brexit means a hard border and the disintegration of supply chains that have been built up over 40 years of EU membership. This is not a binary choice for Northern Ireland between trade with the UK and trade with the EU.”Mr Burke, of Retail Ireland, said that a crash Brexit would have devastating economic consequences.He added: “However, regardless of the type of Brexit agreed over the coming weeks, retailers will see an increase in their operating costs arising from checks at ports and other supply chain disruption.“In the current operating environment, these additional costs simply cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.“Our members continue to work hard to plan for all possible eventualities, but the ongoing uncertainty is damaging our industry and impacting our customers.”Additional reporting by agenciesWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Leaders of retail bodies said reverting to World Trade Organisation tariffs could make the cost of making fresh food and drink available to consumers increase by as much as 45 per cent – which is likely to be passed on to customers. The warning comes days after Birds Eye boss Wayne Hudson said food prices were likely to rise by up to 20 per cent “virtually immediately”\u0026nbspdue to new tariffs.Food and drink production will be made more expensive due to a combination of higher tariffs and new regulatory checks, according to Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Thomas Burke, director of Retail Ireland and William Bain, the British Retail Consortium Europe and international policy adviser.Mr Bain said people in Great Britain will see the price of goods from Ireland and Northern Ireland rise.“Our supply chains are highly integrated, with food ingredients coming from both Ireland and the EU, and 60 per cent of the £2bn of Northern Ireland agri-food bound for Great Britain crosses the Irish sea via Dublin,” he said.Created with Sketch.

A no-deal Brexit will hit us first and hit us hardest. This is not acceptable.”“A hard Brexit means a hard border and the disintegration of supply chains that have been built up over 40 years of EU membership. This is not a binary choice for Northern Ireland between trade with the UK and trade with the EU.”Mr Burke, of Retail Ireland, said that a crash Brexit would have devastating economic consequences.He added: “However, regardless of the type of Brexit agreed over the coming weeks, retailers will see an increase in their operating costs arising from checks at ports and other supply chain disruption.“In the current operating environment, these additional costs simply cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.“Our members continue to work hard to plan for all possible eventualities, but the ongoing uncertainty is damaging our industry and impacting our customers.”Additional reporting by agenciesWe’ll tell you what’s true.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The watchdog said\u0026nbspSolarplicity’s\u0026nbspcustomer\u0026nbspservice “has been poor for a number of months”.Between March and September last year\u0026nbspthere was an unacceptably high proportion of calls abandoned and unacceptably long call waiting times, Ofgem said.Although call handling has improved, the regulator said it “has not seen the required improvements elsewhere”.Created with Sketch.Solar powered bulbs light the way in the developing world Show all 3Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Measures Ofgem has recommended include ensuring customer contact channels are improved, managed and maintained, with queries and issues being resolved in a timely manner, and making sure the switching process goes smoothly, with switches completed within the required timescales. Mary Starks, executive director of consumers and markets at Ofgem, said: “We have taken action against Solarplicity to protect its customers from experiencing further detriment. “Solarplicity must get its house in order and provide a level of service that its customers expect.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Jennifer Lopez, Awkwafina, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Brie Larson, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Amandla Stenberg, Charlize Theron, Tessa Thompson\u0026nbspand Constance Wu will be handing out the statuettes.The show is also expected to focus on\u0026nbspwhat has been a strong year for music in film, with Best Actress hopeful\u0026nbspLady Gaga down to perform “Shallow” from the third remake of\u0026nbspA Star is\u0026nbspBorn\u0026nbspwith director and co-star Bradley Cooper.Gillian Welch and David Rawlings\u0026nbspwill perform “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings” from the Coen Brothers’s The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u0026nbspand Jennifer Hudson will sing “I’ll Fight” from the documentary RBG.\u0026nbspProducer Donna Gigliotti\u0026nbspand director Glenn Weiss have meanwhile been tasked with bringing off a leaner show this time around, running under three hours for the first time since 1973.To achieve this, some of the lower-profile awards will be handed out while the broadcast is in commercial breaks, saving almost an hour after 2018’s telecast staggered on for a gruelling\u0026nbspthree hours and 53 minutes.Which films have been nominated\u0026nbspfor the top prizes?Yorgos Lanthimos’s period drama The Favourite and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma secured 10 nominations each.Both films are have been shortlisted\u0026nbspfor the prestigious Best Picture award, along with Black Panther (a popular choice), BlacKkKlansman, Bohemian Rhapsody, Green Book, A Star is Born\u0026nbspand Vice.The Oscar nominations prove change is coming – but not fast enoughThe Favourite‘s Olivia Colman is in pole position to land Best Actress for her superb performance as Queen Anne while co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will continue their ficitonal rivalry in the Best Supporting Actress category.Christian Bale is hotly-tipped to win Best Actor for his role as former vice-president Dick Cheney in Adam McKay’s satire while the Best Supporting Actor category drew contrasting responses from a delighted Richard E Grant and a very droll Sam Elliott (“It’s about f***ing time”).The Academy has been criticised for again failing to list a female filmmaker in the Best Director category while fans of Timothee Chalamet were disappointed his performance as a drug addict in\u0026nbspFelix Van Groeningen’s Beautfiul Boy was overlooked.You can read a complete list of the nominations here\u0026nbspand an overview of the\u0026nbspbiggest talking points from the announcement here.What happened to the\u0026nbspBest Popular Film category?The new award was announced in August but withdrawn a month later on the strength of the hostile reception it received.Critics and fans argued the category would be used as a means of sidelining crowd-pleasing blockbusters like Black Panther, keeping Best Film free for the “prestige” pictures that usually dominate.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has said it “will examine and seek additional input regarding the new category” and has not ruled out its future revival.The Academy announced in June 2018 it had invited 928 new members of the filmmaking profession to join its ranks.Part of a new initiative commenced under former Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the measure is intended to address the shocking revelation in 2016 that 92 per cent of membership was white and 75 per cent male.Invitations were extended to actors including Amy Schumer, Kumail Nanjiani, Dave Chappelle, Sarah Silverman and\u0026nbspJada Pinkett Smith as well as a host technicians, directors and executives in a bid to improve ersity and offer a broader representation of opinion.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the opportunity to bring new technology and a new approach to the sector,” she said.Craig Donaldson, CEO of  Bank, said the grant “allows us to accelerate our plans to revolutionise banking for SMEs”. “It will help us bring much needed competition to the underserved SME hotspots in the north, while investing in our digital capabilities and creating new jobs,” he added.ClearBank, the first clearing bank to launch in Britain for 250 years, teamed up with SME specialist platform Tide to apply for the grant.Tide\u0027s chief executive Oliver Prill said the grant will help the company grow market share and that it will match the grant with further investment of its own.Additional reporting by wiresWe’ll tell you what’s true.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn fact the iPhone X and XS use the flexibility to remove the bezel at the bottom of the phone: Inside the iPhone, the OLED screen is bent back on itself.Of course, that was only half the answer: The display sits below another layer on a phone, usually glass. It was only when a flexible cover layer was developed that folding phones could happen.The Fold has a 4.7in screen when it\u0027s closed, looking like a regular smartphone, if a bit thicker. Then, it opens up to reveal a second screen inside, which measure 7.3-inches. To put that in context, many smaller tablets on the market boast 7-inch displays.So, how convenient, no need to carry two gadgets any more but still have the joys of the big screen. But, from seeing the new device, I have some initial reservations.First, the bigger display has a weird screen ratio. It\u0027s not quite square but at 4.2:3 is noticeably squarer than many tablets. Samsung displayed a Netflix movie on it, which looked great except that quite a lot of the screen was black bars on either side, which reduced the effect. I suspect it would have looked better on the smaller front display, where it would fill it entirely.This shape means you can display three apps at once, like a YouTube feed, Instagram and a web page. The YouTube element, even in the biggest window, only had a tiny video element, which also wasn\u0027t that appealing.These are early days, though, and there may well be a combination of apps which will work well together.Second, the display didn\u0027t look sensational. Although it opens perfectly flat and images can run across the two with no sense of a join, as the Fold tilted in the light, a straight line that looked like a crease was visible. Perhaps this was because it was an early sample and when the phone is released (26 April in the US, 3 May in Europe) this will have been sorted.Third, can it really justify the cost? In the US, the price starts at $1,980 and in Europe, $2,000. No UK price was given though expect it to be around £1,600 or more. For that money you could buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and a 9.7in iPad and have a lot of cash left over.But you wouldn\u0027t have the convenience of the two-devices-in-one that the Galaxy Fold turns out to be.\u0026nbsp And in terms of innovation, a folding phone is the most exciting development in phone design for years.Samsung Galaxy S10: Best network deals in the UKThe other phones look rather more ordinary in comparison, but offer noticeable upgrades from the current Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ handsets.Both the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ feature a pretty exciting innovation, a fingerprint sensor buried in the display itself that\u0026nbspallows\u0026nbspthe screen to stretch across the whole of the front of the phone. Well, almost.There\u0027s a tiny punch-hole in the S10 screen, a bigger one on the S10+, where the front-facing camera (or cameras on the larger phone) sit.Samsung says that the technology it\u0027s used, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, is the most advanced around and in my brief use of it, it\u0027s very fast indeed and in a day or so\u0027s use recognised my thumbprint 100 per cent of the time –\u0026nbspa little better than rival in-screen sensors from Huawei and others.There is a downside to this tech: It won\u0027t work through thick screen protectors, so check before you buy a protector for your phone.Both cameras also adopt triple camera units on the rear with two 12-megapixel sensors offering wide and super-wide lenses. The wide lens has an automatically adjusting aperture to allow more light in when there\u0027s not much there. The third sensor, backed by a 16-megapixel sensor, is an ultra-wide lens with a field of view which Samsung says matches that of the human eye.The new phones also have two-way wireless charging so that you can place a friend\u0027s wireless-compatible phone against the S10 or S10+ and charge it from the Samsung. Testing it with an iPhone XS Max, it worked instantly and is a very satisfying feeling. Huawei had this feature first, but it\u0027s something every phone should have.The S10e offered some of the S10\u0027s features in a smaller form, so every hand size may find something that fits. But you\u0027ll need big mitts to encompass the final phone release of the evening, the S10 5G. The difference here is, can you guess, it works on 5G networks. It\u0027ll be released in May and has a 6.7in display, the biggest Galaxy S phone yet.The Fold on its own puts Samsung out there when it comes to innovation, but the new Galaxy S10 range –\u0026nbspyou know, the ones most of us will consider buying –\u0026nbspoffer enough choice and a big step forward from last year\u0027s S9 range. The addition of the super-cool inscreen fingerprint sensor on the S10 and S10+ along with the new triple cameras will be enough to tempt many.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within an hour of liftoff, Beresheet was already sending back data and had successfully deployed its landing legs, according to SpaceIL.\u0026nbsp“We’ll keep analysing the data, but bottom line is we entered the very exclusive group of countries that have launched a spacecraft to the moon,” said Yigal Harel, head of SpaceIL’s spacecraft programme.\u0026nbspElon Musk’s SpaceX to have launches reviewed by PentagonElon Musk reveals price of a ticket to Mars on board SpaceX flightsPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was watching the launch live from the Israeli control centre in Yehud, near Tel Aviv.\u0026nbsp“This is a big step for Israel, but a giant step for Israeli technology,” he said.The four-legged Beresheet, barely the size of a washing machine, will circle Earth in ever bigger loops until it’s captured by lunar gravity and goes into orbit around the moon. Touchdown would be 11 April\u0026nbspat the Sea of Serenity.\u0026nbspNasa’s Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s took about three days to get astronauts to the moon, but they used monstrous Saturn V rockets.The $100m (£78m)\u0026nbspBeresheet mission could not\u0026nbspafford its own rocket – even a little one – so the organisers opted for a ride share. That makes for a much longer trip the moon\u0026nbspis currently nearly 230,000 miles\u0026nbspaway.\u0026nbsp“This is Uber-style space exploration, so we’re riding shotgun on the rocket,” Mr Winetraub explained at a news conference on the eve of launch.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspAir Force also has a small research spacecraft aboard the rocket, for a one-year mission in orbit around Earth.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Soviet Union was the first to put a spacecraft on the moon, Luna 2, in 1959. Nasa\u0026nbspfollowed with the Ranger 4 spacecraft in 1962. Last month, China became the first country to land on the far side of the moon.\u0026nbspApollo 11 astronaut\u0026nbspBuzz Aldrin quickly offered congratulations following Thursday’s launch. So did Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine, who called it “a historic step for all nations and commercial space as we look to extend our collaborations beyond low-Earth orbit and on to the moon”.\u0026nbspNasa\u0026nbsphas a laser reflector aboard Beresheet and is offering its Deep Space Network for communication.\u0026nbsp“All the best to @TeamSpaceIL as it starts its journey tonight on a @SpaceX #Falcon9 from Florida to my old stomping ground ... the moon,” Aldrin tweeted.\u0026nbspThe Beresheet mission originally was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even made the final cut before the contest ended last year without a winner. The organisers decided to press ahead on their own, with donations from billionaires as well as schoolchildren.\u0026nbspLunar surface operations are meant to last just two days. Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing site, and send back data and pictures. A time capsule is aboard the lander — which includes a picture of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003 — as well as a lunar library containing 30 million pages on a disk from the US-based Arch Mission Foundation.\u0026nbspRamon’s widow, Rona, was a big supporter of Beresheet she died of cancer in December.\u0026nbspFollowing liftoff, SpaceX recovered the first-stage booster, which flew twice last year. The booster landed smoothly on an offshore ocean platform, after the hottest re-entry yet, according to SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk. Sparks from burning metal were visible in the landing video.\u0026nbspMr Musk said the booster will fly a fourth time in April, during a launch abort test of the new crew Dragon capsule. No one will be aboard.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by APBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Having to say bye to my dad when he’s in handcuffs just hurts my heart. It’s like immigration doesn’t want my family to succeed.”During a meeting at the Jamaican High Commission, the child –\u0026nbspsurrounded by her three sisters, the youngest just a toddler, and mother – delivered a moving testimony that shed light on the impact of immigration control on families.The meeting took place two weeks after\u0026nbspa charter flight taking 29 iniduals from the UK to Jamaica prompted outrage in the wake of the Windrush scandal. Commissioner Seth George Ramocan organised the gathering in the hope that it would\u0026nbsphelp\u0026nbspinform discussions about how they cooperate with the Home Office on future deportations.But there was little discussion about policy or intergovernmental cooperation. From the outset, the meeting was highly charged with emotion, with\u0026nbsprelatives giving\u0026nbspheart-rending accounts of having their loved ones “snatched” from them and sent against their will to a country that, often, they barely knew or remembered.The mother of one man who was on the charter flight – after coming to the UK aged 11 –\u0026nbspexplained how her son had arrived in Jamaica with no one to care for him, and made a passionate plea that “all of our children who came here when they were young should be here. This is degrading. Our children need to come back.”With so many relatives already driven to despair and desperation over the Home Office’s treatment of their loved ones, there was little the commissioner could say to temper them. It was clear that they had little faith in anything he said.This comes as no\u0026nbspsurprise when you consider that many of these people have suffered years of fear and hopelessness at the hands of the British government, despite never being subjected to immigration control themselves.We can debate the use of\u0026nbspcharter flights\u0026nbspand the wider\u0026nbsphostile environment as forms of immigration control,\u0026nbspbut whether\u0026nbspenough attention is paid to the indirect devastation this has on their loved ones is another question.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The same can be said for an unusually high number of gazebos on College Green – the patch of grass outside the House of Lords from which journalists broadcast to the nation.This week an aerial view of the Palace of Westminster was beamed into living rooms across the country as another dramatic week in British politics unfolded.At 10am on Monday, seven MPs quit Jeremy Corbyn‘s Labour Party with a withering assessment of his leadership – the biggest schism in the party since the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 1980s.May eyes potential route out of Brexit deadlock in BrusselsPost-Brexit Britain won’t have any trade links left at this rateEU’s Juncker says he is not optimistic about avoiding no-deal BrexitBarclays sets aside £150m to prepare for Brexit falloutThe following evening, an eighth MP left Labour’s ranks and on Wednesday – an hour before prime minister’s questions – Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen left the Conservative Party to join the opposition benches.Together, the 11 MPs have formed the Independent Group in the House of Commons and, though they have not yet formed a political party, the group has more MPs than the Democratic Unionist Party and the same number as the Liberal Democrats.It means Theresa May‘s effective majority in the chamber has been reduced to eight, making her reliance on the DUP to prop up the government ever more important.While this week has undoubtedly increased the instability at Westminster, the parliamentary arithmetic for Brexit hasn’t shifted a great deal.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Labour split: the reaction on Twitter Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The prime minister still faces the mammoth task of getting her deal through the Commons and, regardless of which side of the Commons the three ex-Tory MPs are sitting on, it is unlikely they will suddenly drop their opposition to Ms May’s deal.Support for a fresh referendum still does not appear to command a majority in the chamber, and the likelihood of the prime minister declaring her support for a customs union (one of Labour’s red lines) remains slim at best.But the current turmoil will inevitably have a considerable impact on the debate. The hardline Brexiteer Conservative MPs in the European Research Group – wary of the effect more defections from the party could have – may provide the prime minister with a temporary show of unity as she continues to negotiate with Brussels.And with just 36 days\u0026nbspuntil Brexit, wavering Labour MPs wanting to avoid a no-deal scenario may feel more inclined to back Ms May’s proposals.

Further votes may take place the following day.However many, including Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, believe Ms May\u0026nbspis planning to delay the meaningul vote until after the European Council meeting on 21 and 22 March, even if an extension to the Article 50 deadline of 29 March\u0026nbspis offered.Labour MP David Lammy said: “It is in those final days that we have the biggest chance to convince MPs to give this decision back to the public.”What will the march be demanding?The key demand is that\u0026nbspany Brexit deal should be put to a public vote for final approval.“Instead of letting Theresa May kick the can down the road until the March 29 deadline, hundreds of thousands of people will march on parliament offering a solution to a crisis that threatens our rights, our living standards and our environment,” said former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas.One proposal for avoiding a no-deal Brexit and securing a second referendum involves tabling\u0026nbspan amendment\u0026nbspin the last week before 29 March.MPs would then approve her deal only if it was subject to a public vote.Where\u0026nbspwill the march take place?The march is set to begin at 12pm, or “high noon”, on Saturday 23 March, on London’s Park Lane.Organisers from the People’s Vote campaign\u0026nbsphave not yet released full details of the route but the march is due to end at Parliament Square with a “mass rally and keynote speeches”.Who will be joining the march?Several leading politicians\u0026nbspincluding Caroline Lucas,\u0026nbspDavid Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Conservative MP Anna Soubry, and the leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in Westminster, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, have already confirmed their support.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspis supporting the march and encouraging readers to attend.The organisers are hoping to widen their appeal beyond those who have previously supported the People’s Vote and Final Say campaigns.\u0026nbspThe Independent‘s petition calling on the prime minister to give the people a final say on Brexit has attracted well over 1.1 million sigantures.“The only way forward out of this Brexit mess is through a People’s Vote,” said Sir Vince.For more details about the Put It To The People march\u0026nbsp– and to sign up – please visit\u0026nbsppeoples-vote.ukmarchFor updates on what’s going on with Brexit, you can register here to receive our new Brexit in Brief newsletter and other benefits.

I don\u0027t believe that it exists on a wide scale. Where there is bad behaviour, we deal with it. Where there is a problem, we deal with it.Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn\u0026nbsprejected claims by deputy leader Tom Watson that bullying was an issue in the party.The news has been dominated today by Ian Austin\u0027s decision to quit the Labour Party over antisemitism. Here\u0027s a helpful profile of the Dudley North MP by PA.Ian\u0026nbspAustin\u0027s long-running battle with Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism in the Labour Party has been shaped by his background as the adopted son of a Jewish father forced to flee the Nazis.Before being elected as MP for Dudley North in 2005, he was an adviser to then-chancellor Gordon Brown.His alliance with Mr Brown continued when he entered parliament, becoming his ministerial aide and then a minister for West Midlands regional affairs.The close political relationship led Tory leader David Cameron to brand him one of Mr Brown\u0027s boot boys.Mr\u0026nbspAustin, 53, also served on the opposition front benches under Ed Miliband.He was never likely to see eye-to-eye with Mr Corbyn, a leader from the left of the party who made no secret of his discontent with the Blair-Brown New Labour era.The issue of antisemitism, which has dogged Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, was the main focus of tensions between the pair.Mr\u0026nbspAustin\u0027s Jewish father Fred was 10 when the Nazis marched into Ostrava in what was then\u0026nbspCzechoslovakia.Four days later he was put on a train to England - the only member of his family able to leave - and he never saw them again.He grew up to become a headmaster and adopted four children - including Mr\u0026nbspAustin.This background had a profound influence on Mr\u0026nbspAustin\u0026nbspand was cited as his main reason for quitting LabourI grew up listening to my dad - a refugee from the Holocaust - teaching me about the evils of hatred and prejudice, he said.One of the main reasons I joined the Labour Party as a teenager here in Dudley more than 35 years ago was to fight racism, and I could never have believed that I\u0027d be leaving because of racism, too.His relationship with the Labour leadership was strained for months before he took the decision to quit.In 2018, Mr\u0026nbspAustin\u0026nbspfound himself facing an internal investigation over alleged abusive behaviour during the party\u0027s anti-Semitism crisis.The probe into the heated discussion he had with party chairman\u0026nbspIan\u0026nbspLavery was eventually dropped.Tory rebel Dominic Grieve is among the Conservatives threatening to quit if the prime minister pursues a no-deal Brexit.He told the BBC: I can\u0027t predict where I might be if the party goes completely off the rails - that\u0027s another matter.The government which I am supporting implementing a no-deal Brexit - what would I do? I would not be able to maintain my support of the government. I would have to leave the party.Jeremy Corbyn in Brussels on Thursday (Reuters)Jeremy Corbyn will lay out his Brexit plans at a meeting of the Party of European Socialists in Madrid.\u0026nbspThe labour leader is expected to hold talks with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez at the event.\u0026nbsp“The damaging deadlock on Brexit must be broken and following my discussions with European Union leaders and officials, I am in no doubt that Labour\u0027s alternative plan is credible and could be negotiated with the EU,” Mr Corbyn said.Please allow a moment for the live stream\u0026nbspto loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

If the government’s official forecasts follow a similar path, £5bn will be added to the deficit in the medium-term.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor is on track for below-target borrowing of £22bn this year but was not entirely optimistic.“Even in spite of today’s good news ...\u0026nbspthere could be tricky fiscal arithmetic for the chancellor as he considers how best to respond to uncertainty around Brexit and how much money to make available to departments at this year’s spending review,” the IFS said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY ITEM Club, said: “A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March.“With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement.“It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) at least for the near term with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

There’s up to...”Mr McDonnell tweeted:\u0026nbsp”Here’s the moment China’s censors pull the BBC World TV feed this morning as I’m speaking about the visiting crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the possibility of him raising the mass extra-judicial detention camps holding many hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uighurs.”However another replay an hour later was not affected and ran straight through.“Maybe they were off making a cup of tea or fell asleep next to the big red censor button,” Mr McDonnell said.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Heres the latest on how its affecting your cash.On February  the pound is trading at . against the euro.The British currency rose off three-week lows against the dollar on Tuesday as Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would seek to speed up ratication of its Brexit withdrawal deal with the European Uniontime gets too tight.Lee Hardman, currencies analyst at MUFG said: The recent bigger picture is still that market participants are actively pursuing downside protection.He said that sterling markets remained relatively calm, with the spot price reflecting more confidence that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the EU. But as the clock ticks down, that optimism is likely to fade, Hardman noted.Before the EU referendum in June  a pound was trading for around €.. Sterling fell around  per cent after the result.The highest rate in recent years was €. in November .Foreign exchangemarkets allow currencies to be bought and sold around the world.They are necessary for international commerce but are also opportunities for traders to make a profit by effectively gambling on whether rates go up or down.As in any market, rates are determined by the price that buyers and sellers are willing to accept.If more people are buying than selling the price will go up, and vice versa.Traders confidence in a countrys economic health is the biggest factor shaping forex markets.Reports and forecasts on GDP growth, inflation, employment, retail sales and manufacturing can prompt traders to buy or sell a countrys currency.Other factors that sway forex markets include interest rate decisions by central banks , and news such as the signing of a trade deal or a natural disaster.Movements in global capital markets, bond markets and stock markets can also influence forex trading.Banks and money changers who sell holiday cash broadly follow foreign exchange markets in the rates they offer the public.The buy and sell price for each currency is usually a few percentage points either side of the true rate so they can make a profit eventhere is no commission.Unstable and unpredictable government events can also negatively impact the pounds strength in trading.Following the resignations of Theresa Mays Cabinet in response to her draft Brexit proposal on Thursday, the pound plummeted to its lowest value in over a year.Euros can be bought at supermarkets, such as Marks  Spencer, as well as the Post Office and currency specialists – but rates y massively.The best rates can often be found at specialist online outlets, such as Travelex, which will deliver cash directly to your home.Travellers can use comparison sites, like MoneySavingExperts TravelMoneyMax, to find the best rate.If you order in advance and pick up the cash then you’ll most likely get a better rate thanyou walk into a bureau de change.Alternatively, providers such as FairFX and WeSwap offer currency cards that can load up at a good rate and then use abroad like a debit card without transaction fees on each purchase.You can always buy last-minute currency at the airport or withdraw cash at your destination, but its almost always cheaper to buy before you go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.On February , , seven MPs held a press conference to announce they were quitting the Labour party.It was the most signicant breakaway since the formation of the Social Democratic Party in the early s.On February  a ninth MP also quit and joined their group.The rebels are:They are furious at Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance and his handling of the anti-Semitism scandal that still dogs the party.Jewish MP Luciana Berger - who has faced vicious abuse from left-wingers - said: I cannot remain in a party that I have come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.Chris Leslie said the party had been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.And Mr Gapes blasted: I am sickened that the Labour Party is now a racist and anti-Semitic party.The seven rebels from the centrist wing of the Labour party have called themselves The Independent Group.It already has a website although it had no content at the time of the announcement.Its Twitter account racked up more than , followers in the first hour after it was opened.It is thought they will sit as independents in the House of Commons, rather than forming an official party at this stage.Mr Umunna, seen as the most likely leader of the group, said: Fundamental change is needed.The established parties are not up to this change. They can’t be the change as they have become the problem.On February  Joan Ryan, chairman of Labour Friends of Israel, also quit the party over Jeremy Corbyns failure to deal with face of evil anti-Semitism.She slammed the Labour leader and the Stalinist clique that surrounds him and said he was not fit to be prime minister.Rumours of a pending split in the Labour party have swirled since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in .And speculation reached a frenzy over the weekend amid reports a group of MPs would finally stage a walkout and launch a breakaway party.The confirmation by the seven rebels came after reports Labour moderates had reached breaking point over Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance, particularly his refusal to back a second referendum.Former frontbencher Chuka Umunna said on Thursday he did not “give a damn... about keeping any party together” when compared to the overriding priority of the national interest in avoiding a No Deal Brexit.And ex-shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told the House of Commons Labour supporters are being “played for fools” by the leadership.On Friday, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said MPs were being pushed to the brink.Mr Murray refused to sign a provocative pledge shared on social media as part of efforts to shore up party unity, insisting his loyalty was not in question.He insisted his loyalty to Labour was not in question.On Sunday shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned a split would cost seats like the SDP breakaway in , which installed Mrs Thatcher in power for a decade.He told the BBC: I dont think any of the people whove even been mentioned about this split would want that.Former party deputy chairman Michael Dugher revealed in the Sun on Sunday on February  he was quitting Labour after  years because of anti-Semitism.He said: “It pains me to see what the Labour party has become.I can no longer justy paying subs to a party which I now regard as institutionally anti-Semitic.Mr Dugher stood down as an MP at the last election, but current MPs have long been said to be close to quitting and Brexit could be the tipping point for some.Up to  current MPs fear they will fall victim to a massive purge by new left-wing activists who have flooded the party.Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper are among those said to be at risk of deselection.Some may decide to jump before they are pushed, switching to a new centrist party that has long been touted in Westminster.Moderates and Remainers have called on the Labour leader to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.Until Feb , fed-up MPs have shied away from quitting but the decision threw the party leadership into fresh turmoil.One of the potential splitters has reportedly told colleagues thatthey walk away they want to “burn the house down” on their way out.They will hope backbench colleagues will follow them out the door, Westminster watchers say.Another crunch point could come ahead of a Commons vote on February  on Theresa Mays Brexit plans.Some backbenchers are reportedly planning to submit an amendment calling for a Peoples Vote, which is not sanctioned by the party leadership.Sources claim ten more Labour MPs are ready to quit and join The Independent Group, plus six Tories could join them.One senior Labour figure said: “It’s a matter of time before others go.“I think you’ll see another ten at least leave Labour in a matter of weeks.“The Independents could be the fourth biggest political party by Easter Sunday.”One insider added that he also expected Labour peers Waheed Alli, Margaret McDonagh, John Reid to sit as Independents in the Lords.In a sign of Labour’s sht under Mr Corbyn, it separately emerged on Monday, February , that s militant Derek Hatton was back as a Labour party member after a  year exile.If Labour splitters started their own party, it would likely aim for the centre-left ground formerly occupied by Tony Blairs New Labour.They would pursue social democratic policies and would be against a hard Brexit, and possibly hoping to reverse Brexit altogether.As well as Labour MPs, the breakaway party would hope to attract Lib Dems and pro-EU Tories.But they would face a struggle to make an impact as the electoral odds are against smaller and less established parties.Part of the reason is the first-past-the-post voting system in general elections, which favours the two biggest parties.In  an alliance of the SDP - formed by breakaway Labour politicians - and the old Liberal party won more than  per cent of votes nationally but only  seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have dumped both.They cannot argue Britain needs another referendum without accepting that their own constituencies have a far more urgent claim for a second vote on them.All that said, we did not disagree with a word as they tore apart Corbyn, his Communist acolytes and the vicious hard-Left sycophants whose sanctimonious hatred pollutes public debate.Labour is now a racist party. Its deranged economics would reduce us to hardship beyond Britain’s experience.It loathes the West and sides instinctively with our enemies, even terrorists.But The Sun has said all this from the moment Corbyn became leader in .Why did it take Brexit for the Seven to finally walk  How could they stomach the rest of it so long That goes tenfold for the scores of Corbyn-hating “moderates” still left.

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004700235452.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jane moore jihadi bride shamima begum","story":"Why  Religious indoctrination played its part but undoubtedly, so too did the romantic ideals of a -year-old girl who watched a couple of IS propaganda videos featuring fired-up jihadi fighters and naively flew off to wed one.Within ten days of landing, she was married to Dutch-born Yago Riedijk, then , who’d been brought up in a “lovely” middle-class family in Arnhem before converting to Islam and joining IS.Tellingly, Shamima says he treated her “really well”, that she still loves him, and “I wouldn’t have found someone like him back in the UK.”In other words, in her deluded young head, a convicted terrorist was quite a catch.But fast-forward to now, and by her own admission, -year-old Shamima is “not the same silly little -year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago.”She says that the whole experience — including losing her first two children and seeing a decapitated head in a bin — has “made me tougher, stronger”.And as we know from her unrepentant interviews, she feels she has done nothing wrong, displays a breathtaking sense of entitlement when demanding our sympathy, and, most heinously of all, feels that the Manchester terror attack was “fair justication” for the women and children killed in the Islamic State.So, as the “tougher, stronger” adult she now is, she must be treated as such and left where she is.Revoking her British citizenship, as Home Secretary Sajid Javid did, is a good start.But the letter sent to her parents has made it clear that her family has the right to appeal and all early indications are that they will.But in the meantime, what of her newborn son He’s an innocent and as, by law, his mother — who reportedly has dual Bangladeshi nationality — was still classed as British at the time of his birth, is he entitled to UK citizenship  Or indeed Dutch If so, given that we routinely remove children from homes where their welfare is under serious threat, we should have no qualms in removing a baby from a mother who is wilfully displaying terrorist sympathies, has lost two children already — one to malnutrition — and is currently living in squalor.AndShamima is as concerned about her baby son’s wellbeing as she claims she is, then she should willingly hand him over to either the UK or Dutch authorities for fostering with a family where love, rather than hate, is the norm.MODEL Abbey Clancy

that, after years of buying The Bloke beautul cashmere sweaters that went unworn, I thought, ‘I’ll teach him’, and bought him a £ laminating machine for Christmas.But he genuinely loved it and set

None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If arrested, their young age means there is little police can do.Constantly monitored by a gang member, they are moved around to avoid detection and given multiple fake identities, while being housed in the most appalling conditions - grotty, over-crowded rooms where they sleep on the floor and food is scarce.They never go to school andthey resist, they are beaten.Police also believe the gang deliberately mutilated some of the children sent to beg and steal to increase their earning potential as disabled children are more likely to evoke pity.For the girls, worse is yet to come as when they reach puberty, they will be forced into prostitution, made to have sex with more than  clients a day in prison-like brothels.These children are modern-day slaves, often sold by their impoverished parents for up to £,, along with the  promise of them having a better le in Britain.According to police, the children are told their families will be at riskthey try to escape, while their relatives are warned their children will be harmedcomplaints are made to the authorities.And nowhere are the profits of these crimes - of money being stolen from Britain through the horror of child exploitation - more visible than on the streets of Tandarei.For most of the , residents of Tandarei, which lies  miles from the capital Bucharest, le is a daily grind of poverty and drudgery.In sharp contrast to the million pound mansions on their doorstep - dubbed the Tandarei palaces - their homes are ramshackle huts without running water and transport is a horse drawn cart along pot-holed roads.Yet it was this growing wealth which first raised suspicions and led to the joint operation between British, Romanian and European police forces which led to  arrests and and the discovery of  trafficked Roma children during raids in Ilford, Essex, with a possible further , victims.Operation Golf was one of the biggest ever crackdowns on human trafficking, which resulted in  criminals being jailed in Britain -  from the Tandarei network alone.Some of those convicted in Britain include mother and father Speranta, , and Gheorghe, , Mihai, Romas with links to Tandarei, who lived in Slough and took their seven children, aged between two and , begging and stealing across south-east England.They pleaded guilty in July  to child cruelty, benefit and tax fraud and money laundering and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years. Reading Crown Court heard they had swindled £, in benefits.When police raided their home, they found the children, infested with head lice and in urgent need of medical treatment, sleeping on the floor and the fridge empty.One of the youngest had scars from where they had been burned by cigarettes. None were in school.During dawn raids on  fortied properties in Tandarei, officers found a shocking cache of weapons, including AKs, powerful hunting rles, knives, pistols and ammunition, along with gold bullion and enormous bundles of cash containing hundreds of thousands of pounds.There were also hundreds of fake British passports, birth certicates and forged Home Office documents for children, which allowed them to fly their victims to Britain with impunity.In the face of such damning evidence, it is surprising to say the least that the case against them has been dropped, their assets ed - meaning for the poor children of Tandarei, it is business as usual.Retired British Superintendent Bernie Gravett says: “They are proper gangsters. These are not just a few people making a few bob, this is an international organised crime ring - one of the largest.“We recovered hundreds of thousands of British pounds, euros, dollars, Romanian lei, . kilograms of gold, AKs, and all of these guys had huge houses, BMWs and Audis.”Bernie’s role in bringing the case to court was pivotal and resulted in a groundbreaking change in the law after he presented a case to the European Parliament in , which meant children could be classed as being trafficked to beg and steal.Before this, trafficking only applied to sexual exploitation, forced labour and organ harvesting.Today, all his hard work is hanging by a thread and with the evidence pointing towards corruption.“These guys have millions and we knew at the outset this was a risk,” he says.For eight years, the criminal case has dragged on. It was postponed during an astonishing  dferent hearings.Over the years, the first prosecutor was changed at the request of the UK over complaints of lack of co-operation and the second prosecutor chose not to use any of the evidence collected in Britain which showed children found in squalid conditions, their fake passports, bruised faces and countless testimonies of their exploitation.And in a telling sign of how things would turn out, prosecutors downgraded the legal status of the children from ‘victims’ to ‘witnesses’.In the final hearing at Harghita Court on February , the judge, at the request of the prosecutor, changed the charges from trafficking in human beings and transnational organised crime to money laundering.This meant the defendants, who have been on bail other than the first  months following their arrest, were all immediately acquitted because of the statute of limitation for this lesser charge.One of the defendants, leader Constantin Radu, who is in his s and is nicknamed ‘Titi the Burglar’, is estimated to have amassed millions through his criminal enterprise.Incidentally, his son Adrian Radu and daughter-in-law, Claudia, were jailed in England in  for  months and six months respectively in a benefits fraud case that cost the UK taxpayer £,.Romania’s Judicial Inspectorate says it will investigate how this happened, but for now, not one person in Tandarei has faced justice in the Romanian courts.Meanwhile, many of the  child victims are missing.There is mounting anger over what has happened, with a spokesman for the NSPCC saying: “Trafficking is a form of child abuse and these desperately vulnerable children need our help, and perpetrators tracked down and brought to justice.“No child should be subjected to ruthless treatment from such gangs which are organised and do not care about the safety of vulnerable children. It is a vile trade and children need to be protected from these predators.”And this week,  international and Romanian NGOs and human rights groups signed a letter calling for the case to be reopened “to make Romania responsible for its specic obligations under the international conventions against organised crime and human trafficking that it is part of.”The letter, sent to around a dozen organisations including the UN, the Vatican, Parliament and the Council of Europe, is headlined: “Call to action…Organised criminals let off in Romania! Organised crime wins as the Romanian Justice System lets off a network of human traffickers the UK and Romanian police were funded to entrap.”It continues: “The UK authorities estimated that for each exploited child the network’s profit was £, per year. Victims identied in UK were exploited for at least two years, with the youngest being only a few months old.“Based on these facts and many other similar cases that are not effectively handled by the Romanian authorities.”Human trafficking expert Silvia Tabusca, from the European Centre for Legal Education and Research, helped organise the letter with Bernie because of her “shock and disappointment” with the way the case has been handled.“The network is still working, everyone knows it,” she says.“Many of the victims are missing now, we couldn’t identy any of them.“We have a huge amount of evidence from the UK. We have videos, testimonials, we have a lot that was not used by the prosecutor and the court.”She explains how many of the child victims were sent back to Romania with no protection, which meant they changed the statements given to British Police as they no longer felt in a safe position to tell the truth.She adds: “When the victims were repatriated in Romania they had no protection at all, so they were placed back in their families and when the victims were heard again by the prosecutor, they changed their testimonials.“Back in Romania, many of the trafficked children reversed their UK statements, and claimed they were well looked after rather than victims of abuse. Evidence from the UK of empty fridges and poor living conditions suggested neglect.“I’ve never understood why the prosecutor took into consideration the second testimonial of the victims when the British police had a specic procedure to ensure the testimonials taken in the UK can be used in the courts in Romania.”Tragically for the town’s children, the exploitation continues, with Germany being the new favoured destination for trafficked minors, although Britain remains a hot-spot.Meanwhile, Romania is classed as the main country of origin for all trafficked people, according to Europol.Back in Tandarei, town hall inspector Constantin Vladila, says the Roma gypsy gangsters have become very rich thanks to the money they receive from their crimes.“With the money they receive abroad they build these villas,” he says. They show off their Gucci shoes and gold necklaces.”Yet not only are they rich, these are hardened, weaponised and ruthless criminals who are not afraid to use violence to exert their iron grip on the town, which is permeated by a culture of fear.The gangs have people watching, called “lookers” on street corners, making sure everyone keeps in line and during one of the raids on the villas, police found a chair bolted to the floor with ankle and wrist straps, which chillingly shows the fate of anyone who doesn’t.As one Tandarei political insider, who was afraid to be named for fear of his reprisals, says: “The gangs even speak proudly about what theyre doing abroad. Here they have the law in their hands.”On the snow-covered streets of Tandarei, locals keep their heads down and refuse to speak or tell their names when approached. Nor will they answer questions as to what is happening to the town’s children.But with the threat of violence looming almost as large as the monstrous mansions paid for by the proceeds of such evil, it is little wonder why.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery.

I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction.

It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography.The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been.And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.She proposed annual meetings between the British and Irish governments after Brexit to ensure the two countries work closely together.She promised to lobby Mrs May on the issue when they hold talks in Belfast on February .She said: We will be reiterating our opposition to the current backstop. And the fact that Parliament has now backed that position means that she has a clear mandate to go back to Brussels.The current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.May also had dinner with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar after her meeting in Brussels to try and break the deadlock in negotiations.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will hold talks in the Irish capital with his Irish counterpart, Seamus Woulfe.Cox has been leading work within Whitehall on providing either a time limit on the backstop or giving the UK an exit mechanism from it.Both proposals have received a dusty response from Dublin, which insists the backstop cannot be time limitedit is to provide an effective insurance policy against theof a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats why The Independent Group is polling in third place just  days after it launched. For those fundamentalists who insist dreamland is the best place to stay, its also appealing to blame the TIGgers for an impending lack of unicorns. But TIG is not the answer to our problems. Oh, its great for providing an escape route to all those who like to complain but have no idea what to do. If youre a Corbynista, Brexit headbanger or raging anti-Semite, the appearance of traitors proves all your conspiracy theories true: it was definitely THEIR fault. And for the average voter - the one whos seen a referendum turn to dust while sleep-deprived toddlers bitchslap each other around Westminster like a kindergarten whose teacher has just stepped outside for three years - it looks a lot like the grown-ups have arrived, offering a coherent, mature, alternative to extremist chaos. Its indisputable TIGs appearance was an attention-grabbing thwack of the Parliamentary blackboard. Unfortunately, its  members have not got a Scooby Doo what to do next. They have told the class to shut up and listen. But they dont know what to say.  If you look at the voting records of its members, TIG agrees wholeheartedly with itself that Britain needed austerity as well as spending. It wants to tax the rich more and less, and wants gays to have both more and fewer rights. It wants more private healthcare and to protect the NHS, to lower and raise welfare benefits, and it simultaneously supports and rejects university tuition fees, mass surveillance, and immigration controls. Its only centristyou add all that up and ide it by the Lib Dems. There are just two topics its members seem to agree on - Remaining, and the smoking ban. Thats not enough common ground to stand on for more than  minutes, never mind a -year Parliamentary term. If their unity couldnt survive a conversation in the pub, what can they achieve  Last month a string of crunch votes on Brexit produced majorities of between just  and  votes. The Brady Amendment which threw Theresa May a leline passed with just , putting our  TIGgers in a strong position to sway Brexit. If they combine with the  Lib Dems and  Scots nationalists - never mind potentially hundreds of dissenters in the main parties - they might command a majority to bring down Brexit, the government, or both. So its a damned shame theyve said they wont.  Well, *they* havent - one of the TIGgers, Gavin Shuker, has said he would prop up the government infor a soft Brexit and second referendum. And theres the problem writ large: theyre independent of each other, as well. They have chosen not to pay the pound Electoral Commission fee to register a new party. Theyve instead rented a room above a Spoons and paid pound to register at Companies House as a limited company, which doesnt exactly look like theyre aiming for Downing Street. Chuka Umunna, who is closest to being the leader the TIGgers dont have, says British politics is broken and urged those from other parties to join them. But when put on the spot hes been unable to name a single current Labour policy he disagrees with, or clearly explain what, exactly, TIG wants. The defection press conferences were aimed not at the electorate but their parties - the equivalent of hurling abuse over your shoulder before slamming the door on your way out. None of it, so far, has included an idea about a better or dferent party.  That hasnt stopped anyone referring to the non-party as a party. It hasnt stopped % of the electorate deciding to vote for the non-electable non-party with no policies. Not knowing quite what they stand for hasnt stopped their enemies decrying what they stand for. And the fact they cant agree on how to deal with % of our problems hasnt stopped any of us hoping they can, nevertheless, fix them. They are the first MPs to recognise and reflect the fact that most British people want Labours economic policies - tax the rich, spend on services, regulate the banks - AND a Tory brake on social change - immigration controls, crime crackdowns, and let Shamima Begum rot . The will of the people is clear, and utterly incomprehensible. So you can hardly blame TIG for incoherent babbling, because the rest of us are frankly no better. Chuka calls them a movement, but it doesnt move us any further on and has yet to find the messiah it needs to drive any meaningful change. Instead, the TIGgers have each picked an enemy of reason - Brexit, anti-Semitism, entryism, tribal politics, Jacob Rees-Mogg - and vowed to smash it.  Any tiger with a spring in its tail would get publicity and public support but  of them, winding up the racists and safe-spacers alike, can expect exactly the degree of hero-worship theyre getting. Thats why theyre not a party. And its why they dont want by-elections. Their aim is not to be a government-in-waiting, but to break the extremist grip which is choking the le out of both main parties. It is worth noting that  by-elections would force these MPs to absent themselves from Parliament at just the point that they could wreak the most havoc on Brexit and those shouting loudest for by-elections are very Brexity. But when May and Corbyns puppeteers have their strings cut, Brexit is delayed or trashed and were looking for new leaders in the wasteland on the other side of March , what is right, and what will be left  TIG is not the answer. It is posing a question those on all sides know must be asked - where do we go next   The TIGgers do not know. They just like to bounce - bounce the voters out of despair, the main parties out of entrail-gnawing complacency. They have no plan for what to do next, because one TIGger couldnt agree with himself, never mind  more. They are not your great, centrist, hope. They are  wrecking balls, hoping to clear the decks for something . That something has yet to manest, and the thing that will decide whether it is populist or popular will depend largely what sort of messiah we get. The first of those two options that gets a charismatic and inspiring leader will be the one to turn our heads. Remember: TIGgers dont roar. Enjoy the bouncing, and lets just hope that when the king of the jungle turns up, its Mufasa and not Scar.

The pledge from the Department for Work and Pensionscomes after campaigners demanded action to close the bizarre and unfair loophole last month. The problem hits council and social housing tenants who pay rent once a week.Many will make  rent payments in   because the financial year has  Mondays. Yet they are due the same amount of Universal Credit asthey paid  weeks, because the six-in-one benefit is calculated dferently.DWP officials at first insisted there are no plans to change the system because it would be too complicated. But now, in a newsletter to landlords, the DWP has said: We are currently considering whether this formulation around weekly rents, and potentially other weekly amounts in theUCcalculation, should be amended.   A DWP spokesman confirmed: “While our policy has not changed, we continue to listen to feedback about Universal Credit and work with claimants and landlords to review how the system is working.”The problem, raised by the NHF and first reported by Inside Housing, is expected to affect Universal Credit claimants who pay weekly rent once every six years.The NHF says that because UC is paid monthly, it is calculated using a formula that effectively takes  of a claimants weekly rent payments and ides the total by . But there are  weeks plus one day in each year. That means every six years or so, a tenant has to make  rent payments, not . Housing associations say the issue will come to a head in   because rent day is usually Monday, and the year has  Mondays. Rochdale Boroughwide Housing expects , tenants to lose out by an average of pound each, while Bolton at Home expects , to lose out by pound each. The DWP admitted in its newsletter: The Department has recognised that there is [an] issue with regards to the way the calculation in the Universal Credit regulations converts a weekly liability into a monthly allowance. The conversion is achieved by multiplying the weekly rent by  and then iding by . This effectively means one day’s rent a yearare not covered byUC. Catherine Ryder, Head of Policy at the National Housing Federation, told the Mirror last month: It’s a really serious situation. This whole mess is entirely avoidable.

The woman, who said she works with MS sufferers, confronted Treasury minister Mel Stride over the long wait for appeals. And she blamed Tory austerity for a system where people wait more than a year for appeals in absolute poverty.It came hours after the BBC revealed people who are denied Personal Independence Paymentsnow wait an average of  days for an appeal.More than two thirds of full tribunal appeals overturn the original decision - but claimants say the system, where assessments and reconsiderations are overseen by the DWP and tribunals by the Ministry of Justice, is struggling to cope.  One in  disabled people have to wait more than  months for an appeal, the BBC reported. The woman told the BBCs flagship debate show: For you to sit there and say the Tories are looking after the most vulnerable in society is absolutely appalling. Every day in my job I see people who are vulnerable, who are being made iller because of the PIP process. They are people who are very very unwell. The PIP process is making them even more unwell, it takes over a year to get to a tribunal then the decisions are usually overturned. In the meantime theyre left without their mobility cars, they cant travel, theyre living in absolute poverty. And that is all because of austerity and the Tory government.  Following the BBCs story yesterday, the DWP said it was committed to ensuring disabled people get the support they need. Assessments work well for the majority of people, but one persons poor experience is one too many, and were committed to continuously improving the process for people so that they get the support they need, a spokesperson said. Under PIP in Wales, % of people are getting a higher rate of support than they were previously getting under DLA. .m PIP decisions have been made, and of these % have been appealed and % have been overturned.

Campbell, , snatched little Alesha from her bed as she visited her dad and grandparents on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, in July last year. He brutally attacked and raped the ft ins youngster before dumping her body in woodland on the scenic and sparsely populated island. Smiley Alesha, who loved watching Peppa Pig and baking cakes, was later found facedown and naked by a member of the public. She had  separate injuries - including catastrophic ones. Campbell, who lived on the island, was yesterday found guilty of her abduction, rape and murder by jurors at Glasgows High Court. And this afternoon, he could be identied for the first time after a judge allowed his name and images of him to be published. Lting a ban on identying the boy, Judge Lord Matthews said: I cant think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion. But who is Campbell and what is his background  Below, we reveal everything we know so far about the monster.  What did Campbell do  Campbell abducted, raped and murdered Alesha, who was staying at the home her dad shared with her grandparents on Bute. The little girl, who was on a three-week summer break, had been put to bed with a Peppa Pig DVD on the night of July , . But the next morning, she was found to have vanished. The High Court later heard Campbell had snatched the girl from the bed where she was sleeping, before inflicting horric injuries on her. He then dumped her body in a woodland area on the island. Alesha was reported missing from her bed at .am on July , with Police Scotland launching a large-scale search to find her. At around am, her naked body was devastatingly found on the grounds of the islands former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel.  A post-mortem found she died from pressure to neck and face. Within days of Aleshas death, Campbell had been arrested and charged. During his trial, the court heard graphic details of Aleshas injuries, with a pathologist saying: Its extremely dficult to give an accurate time of death. When askedthe injuries observed were something he had witnessed before in his years of forensic experience, Dr John Williams replied: No. Yesterday, Lord Matthews told Campbell he had committed some of the wickedest, most evil crimes the High Court had ever heard. Who is Campbell  Campbell was a -year-old cannabis smoker, living on Bute. He had moved to the island with his family as a child, and lived with his mum, dad and younger sister in a traditional stone-built home. He had been born on the mainland, but his family had brought him to the island believing it would give him a secure upbringing. His mum told the Daily Mail: I wanted him to grow up in a safe place, a peaceful environment, and get a good education.  She added that her very normal son was doing an engineering course one day a week and had plans to go to university. Known to pals as a harmless joker with a dark sense of humour, Campbell had started regularly buying cannabis at the age of . He would drink at weekends with friends and had a girlfriend, who is reported to be standing by him despite his brutal crime. He also liked to practice parkour, which involves moving rapidly through areas and jumping from buildings, the Daily Record reports. And he was a fitness fan who enjoyed boxing and lting weights. A video of Campbell, posted on his YouTube channel the year before Aleshas murder, shows him doing carefree flips on a trampoline. He brags he recently went from doing front flip s to front flip .  Had he shown signs of violence  Campbells mum has said he wasnt a violent boy. But reports have claimed he was a “serial killercaught on his first murder” who was obsessed with the horror character Slender Man. He is alleged to have been obsessed with gore and violence. A police source told The Sun: “Slender Man searches were found and it chilled seasoned investigators to the bone. Some of the circumstances between what this character does and what happened to Alesha were carbon copies.” The teenager was filmed playing violent video games, and officers found evidence he had searched online for the Slender Man. In one clip, he can reportedly be heard shouting stab and shank. In another, he yells: That is Slender Man right there.” Slender Man is a fictional character that began le as an Internet meme before growing into something much darker.  He has long arms, which he uses to prey on children, and is portrayed as a black and white image on the periphery of photos. Campbell is also alleged to have nearly drowned a dferent young girl at a leisure centre pool years before Aleshas murder. He was just six or seven when he held the youngsters head under the water for so long she feared she would drown, Bute locals claimed. And the killer is said to have slaughtered and skinned cats in his younger teens, apparently burying two feline corpses in his garden. One neighbour also claimed Campbell had become a local nuisance on Bute and was once caught trying to set fire to buildings. None of the stories, including the near-drowning, have been corroborated, but they have been making the rounds on the island. However, his mum insisted to the Mail: He wasn’t a violent boy. He smoked cannabis, but it’s re among kids on this island.  What did Campbell tell pals  After Alesha vanished, Campbell chipped in with speculation and rumours about what may have happened on a Snapchat group chat. He even sent a video of himself to pals on the group and said: Found the guy whos done it - something a friend thought was a bad joke. The teenager also sent friends a chilling Facebook message saying he might kill one day for the letime experience, his trial heard. The court was told he exchanged messages about killing with a pal. The female friend asked him the chances of getting away with murder with a good plan, to which he said: Wellit was a gd plan then %. She later messaged: Im glad Im not at the top of your hit list. In response, he was alleged to have said: No one is. The witness agreed these were theoretical exchanges where she brought up the subject of murder and at the time caused her no concern. She said they both had a dark sense of humour. And she agreed the conversation was not serious and just rubbish.  What did Campbell claim about the murder  After police were led to Campbell by his own mum, the monster told ious lies about what he did on the night Alesha vanished. Sickeningly, he even tried to blame Mr MacPhails innocent partner, Toni McLachlan, for the crime and claimed hed had an affair with her. On his trials first day, he lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Ms McLachlan as the person responsible for the killing. However, jurors heard DNA matching Campbell was pretty well all over Aleshas body and clothes, and he had told police a pack of lies. Giving evidence in court himself, the teenager told the jury hed never do something like that in reference to the attack last summer. He claimed that he never met Alesha MacPhail in person. Askedhe brutalised the girl, he said: Its not me, absolutely not. I would never do something like that.  But when jurors were out of the courtroom, he is said to have been spotted smirking. The teenager, described as an adrenaline junkie, also told the court he and Ms McLachlan had met up and had sex early on July . He claimed he did not want to tell police this as he feared it would get back to Mr MacPhail and he would hurt Ms McLachlan. But addressing the jury on Wednesday, advocate depute Iain McSporran QC, prosecuting, said the teenager was telling a pack of lies then [to the police] and a pack of lies in the witness box. During his closing speech, Mr McSporran put it to jurors that they had heard no evidence implicating Ms McLachlan in the crime but a mountain of evidence linking the accused to it. He also said a claim by Campbell - that Ms McLachlan had taken the condom the two allegedly used on July , gone back to the house where she had been staying with her partner, Alesha and the girls grandparents, abducted the schoolgirl, carried her to the woods, smothered her to death and then planted the accuseds semen inside her - was a preposterous story. However, the teenagers defence lawyer, Brian McConnachie QC, urged the jury to acquit his client, questioning why he would abduct, rape and murder the youngster having never met her in his le.  What was he convicted of  Yesterday, justice was finally served as Campbell was unanimously convicted of abduction, rape and murder by jurors. Another charge against him - defeating the ends of justice - had been dropped by the prosecution on the eighth day of proceedings. The killer - who now faces le behind bars - had denied all charges. Aleshas loved ones broke down in tears as the verdict was ed. Campbell will be sentenced next month. Why couldnt Campbell be identied  During his nine-day trial for Aleshas murder, the teenager could not be identied for legal reasons because he is aged under .

In late , after suffering for around  months, Kara ditched her heavy foundation and courageously shared slap-free photos on Instagram, attracting praise and thousands of followers. Kara said: “It is scary to put myself out there, hitting that send button is a big thing. “I used to edit all my photos, but then I stopped and thought, ‘No, you’re putting this out there for a reason – to show your real skin. “On Instagram especially, everything is so flawless and filtered that I knew there was a gap that needed to be filled for people to embrace their insecurities.”   Growing up, Kara never had any problems with her skin. But all that changed around three years ago, when she stopped taking the contraceptive pill. She said: “I believe it was down to the imbalanced hormones in my body. I went to the doctor, and was placed on a dferent type of pill, but all that did was mask my symptoms. “As soon as I stopped taking it, my skin flared up again, even worse than before.”  At first, Kara thought her skin would settle back down once her body adjusted to the hormonal changes. But after around three months, there were no signs of improvement and so she ed to the doctor and was given antibiotics, which had little effect. So, taking to the internet, she began to read up about cystic acne, and became convinced it was what she had. “It was a real knock, confidence-wise,” she said. “I wouldn’t even leave the house without make-up on. I’d cake it on evenI was just popping to the shop. I’d even wear it in the gym, which, looking back, I know is ridiculous.  “Thankfully, nobody ever said anything nasty, but I would get stared at, and I could tell what people were thinking.” Though she initially attempted to treat her acne with topical medication, Kara decided in  to opt for a more natural approach instead. After taking an intolerance test she ordered online, she realised she had been unknowingly eating things that were making her skin worse. So, she overhauled her diet, eliminating dairy and gluten, and cutting right down on sugar.  “At first, I didn’t see an immediate effect, so it was hard to stick to,” she said. “But after around six weeks, my skin started to improve, and so that spurred me on.” Also introducing supplements and vitamins to her daily regime, Kara, who only uses natural, organic products as harsh chemicals can have an adverse affect on her skin, ditched medication for good. Keen to use her experiences to help others, she has set up an Instagram where she shares tips and advice, as well as candid photos of her airbrush-free skin. She explained: “I am also a trained make-up artist, so wanted to start a beauty blog, but give it my own inidual spin so started posting a lot about my skin, and DIY healing.  “The more I shared, the more messages I got, mainly from others in the acne community wanting to knowsomething I was trying had worked. “Now, I have a really loyal following – we’re more like a group of friends.” By speaking out, Kara, who hailed her boyfriend of three years for supporting her, hopes to encourage others to embrace their insecurities and see past the filtered, edited world of Instagram. And, while she admits that she still feels nervous about uploading her bare-faced selfies, she said that banning herself from editing her perceived imperfections has helped her to accept them.  “The only way to build confidence is be true to yourself. If you carry on hiding away or editing a part of yourself, you’ll never accept it,” she said. “I upload my photos for all those people who don’t have the confidence, or feel they can’t among all those flawless Instagram pictures. “I still have peaks and troughs with my skin, but I have learnt not to compare myself to other people.” Speaking of the link between acne and the contraceptive pill, Dr Zenon Andreou, GP at Zava, Europe’s largest online doctor, said: The combined contraceptive pill is sometimes prescribed as a way of treating and controlling acne, as it can stabilise fluctuating hormone levels which can lead to skin inflammation, spots and in some cases, acne. Coming off the combined contraceptive pill can cause changes to your skin and its not uncommon for women to experience an acne flare up. If your skin hasn’t settled down after a month or two of coming off the pill, orthe flare up is extensive, speak to your doctor to find an alternative acne treatment. It’s worth noting that the progesterone only pills and the contraceptive implants can sometimes worsen acne, so do consider this when looking at contraceptive options.

Speaking on her TV show Dr Lee said: The biggest challenge is maintaining Joses hairline. I need to repair this area so that the hair grows in a normal way. On the operating table Dr Lee uses her hands to dig out most of the lipoma while pushing and pulling at Joses head.   It was a huge challenge as it was very fibrous and wouldnt simply pop out of Joses head. Dr Lee had to laboriously take out piece by piece, cutting each part away. I know it might look barbaric for me to use my fingers, but it is much better to use my fingers than to use something sharp. She eventually managed to take the entire tumour away before delicately recreating his hairline.

Brian Gaze, The Weather Outlook forecaster, said: It will be warm enough for some to break out the BBQs this weekend, with incredible winter temperatures and sunshine. Highs could challenge the .C record in coming days.  Ben Rich, BBC weather presenter, said: The jet stream has picked up really, really warm air from close to the Caribbean and is bringing it in our direction. It is essentially tropical air. Wales and the Midlands will enjoy the best of the sunshine this weekend, forecasters said.  The plumes of tropical air is moving in from the west and so eastern and southern areas are likely to bask in the warmest temperatures early into the week. The Met Office added: A flow of air from the Canary Islands is bringing highs potentially -C above average, with very, very nice conditions and extended sunshine. It stays mild into next week. There is a big area of high pressure moving across the UK, so it will be nice and sunny too.

David and Louise Tuprin have pleaded guilty to  charges, including abusing minor and adult children, reports The State.They also confessed to imprisoning them in their house. Police raided the Turpins home in Perris in January last year, after an emaciated -year-old girl escaped through a window and called . Officers found the girls  brothers and sisters - ranging in age from  to  - trapped inside the darkened, foul-smelling house, with some even chained to beds.   The siblings, suffering from malnourishment, muscle wasting, stunted growth and other signs of severe abuse, were taken into protective custody and their parents were arrested. Prosecutors said the victims were deprived of food, basic hygiene and medical care. It has also been claimed the children were harshly punished for trivial reasons, such as wasting water by washing their hands above the wrist, and even taunted with food they were forbidden to eat. Defence lawyers are yet to offer an explanation for the circumstances alleged by authorites.  Described as a deeply religious couple, the Turpins home-schooled their children and made them memorise Bible scripture, according to Davids parents, James and Betty Turpin. One of the siblings, a -year-old, alerted authorities after they had escaped in a harrowing  call.

But the main factor you have to consider when selecting a baby name, is whether both you and your partner will be happy with it.An expectant mum has picked out the perfect name for her son, including a middle name that means a lot to her, but theres just one problem with it.The name she wants to use is special because it belonged to her ex-boyfriend who passed away, and its fair to say her current boyfriend isnt feeling all that good about it.  In a post on Reddit, the dad-to-be, asked the good people of the internet whether he was an a**hole* for not wanting to name his son after his girlfriends ex.He wrote: My girlfriend and I are expecting our first born son. The other night when discussing names, she said she would like his middle name to be that of her ex, who died. Saying further that it would mean a lot to his family who she is still close with. The unnamed man said the name would make him really uncomfortable and he didnt want to do it, but his partner didnt see a problem with it.  He continued: I dont want to tell people, especially my son, that he is partly named after another man who his mum loved before me. She said, Why cant you say he is named after my friend who died  We werent even together when he died. To make matters more complicated, the ex died of a drug overdose, and the dad doesnt want to have to tell his child that fact either. He finished his post by saying he felt it was pretty s***** of his girlfriend to ask him to do this in the first place.   And many people agreed with him - with over  people commenting on his post. One person replied: Thats weird. You dont like the name for obvious reasons, and your girlfriend should respect that. A second agreed: Its a useless gesture anyway. Itll make her feel better for five minutes and then it will fade. Seems like a super immature request. Anytime someone asks about the middle name its going to make you feel terrible, added a third.

He also boasts stunning shots of himself standing before the Caribbean pink salt pans in Bonaire and at the foot of Chichen Itza in Mexico.  Alina and Andrei, an ex-Finance Manager in a multinational company and a dentist respectively, said they wanted to travel with their son because he spent too much time with other people. Erics mother Alina, , said: We always loved traveling and tried to visit new places each holiday. Having a kid wasnt a reason to change our lestyle, we just adjusted our travel plans. We started with short trips when he was a new born and then a three week road trip through Italy after he turned  months.  We had great moments traveling together, which encouraged us to continue. We were sick of the same routine and hated the fact that our son was spending more time with other people than with us. We had the chance to take a break and took advantage of it. There was no better use of our time than to spend it together, visiting beautul places. Starting this journey was the best decision weve ever made.  During their latest adventure only, the Cechlans have been through four continents and  countries.

The family uses public transport and eat in whenever they can.  Despite the struggle of being constantly on the go, Alina said seeing what the world has to offer to her son is invaluable The most dficult part is not having any free time just for ourselves, she admitted. Theres no daycare, nanny, grandparents or friends to watch the kid from time to time.  We are together   and only have free moments during his nap time. We sometimes miss a relaxing dinner for two or an evening out with friends. That said, nothing compares to seeing the world through your kids eyes or spending so much quality time as a family. We are amazed at how many things he remembers and the associations hes already making. You get the chance to see how little you need in terms of material possessions, including for the child. He had a pile of toys back home and he never seems to miss that now that he only has two or three.  At present, the family are in Singaporea child friendly but very expensive cityand plan on carrying on with their travels until Eric starts school. Alina said she wants to encourage other families to go travelling with their kids, no matter how young they may be. There are lots of misconceptions that it is dficult, or dangerous, or not worth the trouble because they wont remember anything. You cant understand the huge positive impact travel has on the little ones and on the whole family until you see it with your own eyes.

Petr Augustyumln manages Fauna Park, a sanctuary that houses more  dferent species, from monkeys and meerkats to cougars. With the help of his family in Lipovaacute, Czech Republic, the -year-old has been working with dangerous animals for the last  years. Describing the animals as the ‘centre of his le’, Petr interacts closely with tiger Diego. Petr said: “My favourite moment is when I go in with the animals. It’s an incredible feeling, that the animal perceives you as an equal.   “They want to cuddle you and show their love to you. It’s indescribable. “It’s a kind of adrenalin rush, the respect, but mainly there’s love.” Petr’s first animal encounter was with two parrots more than  years ago and his love grew from there. “First I had parrots, then I added monkeys and enlarged my iety to tigers and big cats,” Petr said. “Eight years ago, I bought my first puma called Babu. She is a female. “And then, three and a half years ago, I bought Diego when he was just eight weeks old. He is my tiger. “Diego was with me a lot until he was nine months old. He even shared my bed. He spent a lot of time with me and animals are grateful for this kind of interaction.”   Petr allows the tiger cubs to interact with his family and live inside their home until they reach a certain age and size. Tomas Augustyumln, Petr’s son, helps to take care of the ground maintenance at the park and to feed the animals - the big cats eat around kg of meat per day. But Petr is quick to admit the potential dangers that strangers would facethey were to ever enter the animal enclosures. He said: “My family works with me in the Fauna Park. It’s me, my we, my son and daughter. “And we have three other employees that the animals are used to. “Now, I can recognise what mood they’re in, when I go into the cage and look into their eyes. “The animal tells you with its behaviour and its gestures,it’s in the mood to play with you or not. “If it’s a snoring sound for instance, it’s good, you can enter. The worst case is when the tiger is lying down, with his ears backwards.   “They’ve never attacked me. If a stranger entered however, it wouldn’t end the same way. If it’s someone they don’t know, I don’t think it would end well. “These animals were born in captivity – and this environment is their safety. “I think in the wild, that hunger would force them to find some food, but it would be very dangerous. These animals are used to humans. Any contact could be fatal.” Petr dedicates his le to his animals and is now looking forward to adding more species to his ever-growing collection. Petr said: “I don’t have a favourite animal, I love them all equally. It’s not about one being better than the other. “I love them all the same, simple as that. “These animals are my le. I’d even say my whole family’s le. “I think that the care and love that they get here, they could never get anywhere .” "},{"url":null,"title":"model who sold virginity 2m","story":"NewsModel who sold virginity for £m to be rented by politician for £k a monthMahbuba Mammadzada, , is yet to meet or speak to the man she will have sex with, and has only seen a photograph of himShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsMs Mammadzada, is registered with the agency under the nickname of Maria \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A model who sold her virginity for more than poundmillion will reportedly then rent herself out to the man as a girlfriend - in exchange for a pound, allowance.The person who will have sex with Mahbuba Mammadzada, , for the first time is a politician from Tokyo. But Mahbuba, who goes by the name of Maria, says she is yet to speak to him and has only seen a photograph of him. The consummation will reportedly take place at a hotel in Germany, where selling sex is legal. Maria will then continue to meet up with the millionaire politician as she plans to rent herself to him as a girlfriend for a monthly pound, allowance, on top of the fee for her virginity, according to reports. She told the Daily Star: Although I have to meet with him more often , I like the idea of being ‘rented as a girlfriend’a man financially supports me monthly with a generous budget.  Maria, whose second highest bidder was a famous footballer, said: I feel great. I am excited and looking forward to it. It will certainly be a wonderful experience. Even though I am already very successful with modelling, earning so much money in such a short time is a dream come true. Maria added: We havent spoken. But the agency told me he thinks Im hot. I just think being the first one is special for a man. And since Im an international model, Im sure he sees me as a status symbol. I can deal with it.

I have always been overweight from a young age, Eimer, who used to live on take-outs and processed food, she said. I used food as a coping mechanism for being bullied which spiralled into my adult le. I was very unhappy within myself and day to day things felt like a struggle for me.  Eimer, who described herself as a typical yo-yo dieter, joined slimming groups and tried a iety of diets.But because of her arthritis requiring weekly steroid injections that are known to increase hunger, she would struggle to stick to them in the long run.The mum said she finally resolved to shed weight after seeing pictures of her daughters christening five years ago at st lb and a UK size . She said she started studying nutrition and that worked for me. Thanks to more exercise and a healthier diet, Eimer is now st lb and a UK size .  Now I feel great, I am a big believer in having a little bit of everything within your diet. I follow a well-balanced plan so it is sustainable, she added. Planning and preparation of food is key. I also joined the gym three days a week which is hard to manage now with my psoriatic arthritis, but I keep active with walking and hoping to work my way back to the gym. Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that develops in some people with the skin condition psoriasis. It causes joints to become swollen, stf and painful. It is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse but with the correct treatment and diagnosis this can be slowed down.  Before her weight loss, Eimer would skip breakfast and have a breakfast roll as a mid-morning snack, lunch of a sandwich, crisps and fizzy drink, dinner of an oven pizza, microwaveable meal or takeaway and would snack on chocolate, crisps and sweets. Now, she has porridge with almond milk and fruit syrup for breakfast, a lunch of homemade soup and a -calorie wrap filled with chicken salad, and chicken curry and pasta bolognaise for dinner, made from scratch with her slow cooker. She snacks on -calorie chocolates and rice cakes with natural peanut butter and strawberries  .  For Eimer, the most dficult thing about her weight loss was managing her appetite while taking the injections. The medication I am on can increase appetite so that was one problem I had and mainly keeping my head in the game as they say. You need to be strict but also not to deprive yourself, she said. People are very positive about my weight loss, wanting to know how I did it, was it hard and how I maintain the weight loss. If its what you really want make the first step, whether its to join a group, get help from a professional oryou are in the right mind frame anything can be achieved.  Three words I use frequently when helping people would be: balance, you need a good balance of food to keep you interested and satiated habit, over a period of timeyou keep at it, it will turn into more of a habit than a struggle and lastly routine,its in your le, you practice and keep going with it, it can be a routine where it becomes a lot more manageable.

If they score I am happy andwe keep winning I am happier!“I just have to be patient and enjoy being part of this team.“It’s been good so far.“In the last year I’ve not played a lot of football so now I’m just enjoying training and being part of the team.“I played for a month or so at MK Dons before I came here but it’s all good.“I am feeling better and better every day, every day is a step in the right direction and I just need to play more and more football.“I am happy as long as we keep winning.”Sow scored  goals for Hearts as they won the Championship back in  so he knows exactly what is required to go all the way and get back to the top flight.The - victory at Palmerston at the weekend was a dficult afternoon, particularly in the second half when the  men of Queens put the United rearguard under pressure.Sow, though, is only worried about one thing – racking up another win to move a step closer to their goal.He said: “At the end of the day, it’s the three points that matter.“Palmerston is a tough place to go to but we managed to see the game out and we’re pleased with it.“Everybody is happy, it’s all about winning the games and, as long as we keep getting the three points, it’s good.“It is dficult to win any league, to get promoted from any league no matter where.“It is about making the most of every day and not getting ahead of ourselves.“We need to train well every day and then win on Saturdays.”After working with the striker in his time as Jambos manager, United boss Robbie Neilson was quick to take him south with him when he took the reins at English League One side MK Dons.That didn’t work out in the end for either but that’s not stopped Robbie moving again for the -year-old.And that repeated backing of his ability gives Sow enormous confidence – a backing he is keen to repay as soon as he can by helping the Tangerines to the Premiership.He added: “Definitely, I enjoy working with him and Dundee United are a good club who deserve to be in the top ision so it all felt good.“I’m here now and it’s about taking every day at a time and trying to get over the line to where we want to be.“I enjoy the manager’s way of working and his football and I believe in what he is doing.“Definitely it gives me confidence that he’s signed me and I’m just trying to give back to him.”And Sow hopes he can begin to do that against Falkirk this coming weekend.“I’ll see what happens for the Falkirk game but the most important thing is we keep winning and the time will come for me to play my part.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c6d2bf518b7c8.40011629.jpg ","title":"tom duthie deeiy sos then dundee boss jim mcintyre is the man to call","story":"Rather understandably, no one has asked Jim McIntyrehe’s a fan of the hit BBC show DIY SOS.Perhaps we should, becausehe leads Dundee to safety this season he might just be able to lay claim to being the Scottish Premiership’s version of its presenter Nick Knowles.For those lucky enough to watch only football on the box, it’s the one where Knowles and a team of tradesmen step in to help families or groups with building projects they don’t have the knowhow or resources to complete on their own. To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"scotswoman-of-the-year-the-sweet-story-of-kimbles-in-glasgow","story":"CHILLI jam and green tea jostle for position on the deli shelves, ladies lunch in the bright cafeacute, chatting over chicken and avocado sandwiches and a cheeky glass of fizz."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potholes-20000-craters-rack-up-more-than-1m-in-repairs-in-2018","story":"MORE than pound, was paid out to Glasgow drivers for damage caused by potholes last year, new figures show."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-comes-together-to-give-west-end-youngster-confident-boost-over-her-new-glasses","story":"A YOUNG girl from Glasgow has won the hearts of the internet this week after the city came together to make her feel less ldquoashamed about her new glasses."},{"url":null,"title":"epilepsy-scotland-des-clarke-among-names-for-fundraiser-comedy-night","story":"EPILEPSY Scotland is warming up ahead of its third annual Patter Merchants Comedy Clash."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"how-celtic-rated-as-they-salvage-pride-but-head-out-of-europe-after-valencia-defeat","story":"BAIN: Two fine saves in the latter stages of the opening period the first was a cracking fingertip save to knock Daniel Parejorsquos netbound effort over the bar.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14036524.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_swr_ayp_130219hospice2.jpg","title":"ayrshire hospice marks 30th birthday","story":"NewsAyrshire Hospice marks th birthday as staff and volunteers reflect on three decades of serviceThe milestone birthday has been marked with a series of events and celebrations.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor  years it has touched the lives of thousands in Ayrshire and far beyond.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane february 15 2019","story":"Maths and science teacher and latterly computer programmer, Roger Breckenridge, from Minnesota, USA told the Courier: #As far as I am aware the last Breckenridge to live in Campbeltown, was James Breakenridge who died in .#I have finished my own Breckenridge genealogy and have traced my Breckenridge lineage back to Glencraigs, just a couple of miles north of Campbeltown, along the Tarbert Road.#My ancestors were tenant farmers at Glencraigs, then called Craigs in the early to mid s.#Some of his ancestors are buried at Kilkerran cemetery and he specically knows there are graves for Andrew Breckenridge and his we Janet Finlay.In one posting, on the Courier#s Facebook page, Mr Breckenridge has askedany readers know where the Breckenridge#s rest and whether it would be possible to have photographs emailed.He is also looking for a very old place-name, possibly Glenreavoll,  concerning a Breckenridge family.Mr Breckenridge said: #All I know is that Glenreavoll must have been located somewhere in Scotland but not necessarily in Argyll or Kintyre.#A Breckenridge family lived at Glenreavoll in the year .#I have no idea what Glenreavoll was or where it was located.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Activities will be relocated where in Musselburgh.A spokesman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe building on Bridge Street, which currently houses the cafeacute, is used for a small number of hours each week. The initiative was launched in  when internet access was less readily available at home, school or in other settings.ldquoIn recent years, visits to the building have tended to be for generic youth activities. There is limited space for such activities within the building which can be accommodated where, enabling access to a wider range of activities and resources. This will allow us to make increasingly effective use of assets in a challenging financial climate.Turning to the MECLC, he stressed that the centre, a council building managed on its behalf by FES, would not close and there would be no displacement of current activities. It was, he added, about ldquomaximising use of the building in the delivery of services.The spokesman explained: ldquoIt is proposed that a small number of CLD staff who currently work out of office facilities within the Musselburgh East Community Learning Centre, relocate to office facilities at an alternative location. These staff are not involved with the day-to-day running of the building or the activities which take place there, as it is managed by FES under a separate contract. This arrangement continues.ldquoWe are always keen to maximise the use of community buildings and are exploring whether it might be possible to establish additional provision within the building in the future.

Relocation of staff will not have any effect on activities that are run from or at the centre. The management group will continue to work with and support East Lothian staff with projects and activities.Councillor Stuart Currie, a Musselburgh member and leader of the SNP Group, said: ldquoThe whole point of the Inter.Esk Cafe was to provide facilities for young people in a safe place.

He added that Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council or the wider community had not been consulted.He described the decision to relocate CLD staff as a ldquocash grab.Mr Currie said: ldquoMy concern is that the centre was built in the heart of the community and the whole point of having people working for the council is that they should be based in the community.

Relocating the CLD staff from MECLC allows other options for this building to be considered including use by East Lothian Council departments or sub-let to a third sector organisation.Councillor John Williamson, SNP, commented on the closure of the Inter.Esk Cafe, saying: ldquoFor the sake of pound, a year the Inter.Esk Cafe is going to close following decisions made by Labour and Conservative councillors at the East Lothian Council budget meeting on Tuesday. The cafeacute provides a safe place for young people aged - to meet, have access to computers, make friends and get support for any issues they are having to deal with.ldquoIt is centrally located in Musselburgh and on a main bus route so is easily accessible to users.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-spending-your-wedding-anniversary-with-nicola-sturgeon","story":"SOMEHOW we stumbled into stories about ringing for service in pubs, and Bob Cameron recalls: \"In a pub near Glasgow Yoonie in the sixties a group of students spotted a bell on the wall.

In his excellent history of the foundation of the SDP, Claret and Chips, Hugh Stephenson made the telling point that, though the party often claimed to be ldquobreaking the mould of British politics, it was doing no such thing. Slightly left-of-centre social democracy had, in fact, been the policy of all post-war UK governments until the arrival of Margaret Thatcher. It was her ldquoconviction politics that shted what was regarded as the political centre Labour party in the late s, which in turn led to the SDPrsquos foundation.Arguably, we have since had a sort of slightly right-of-centre market capitalism as the policy of all governments, made in part by Tony Blairrsquos creation of New Labour in the mould of, well, the SDP, and then David Cameronrsquos rebranding of the Conservatives as, well, New Labour.Read more:Who are The Independence Group  Former Labour MPs form breakaway partyWe can argue about the extent to which parties actually live up to their rhetoric: the welfare state grew under Mrs Thatcher, for example, while tax revenues fell during Gordon Brownrsquos premiership . But itrsquos the rhetoric that marks whatrsquos usually called the Overton Window ndash political ideas which are currently accepted as ldquosensible or ldquopopular, and thus stand a chance of becoming policy. Ideas characterised as ldquounthinkable, ldquoradical orldquocourageous are outside it.Every economist in the universe, for example, no matter how left-wing, thinks Donald Trumprsquos steel tarfs are a bad idea. But they are politically popular with his supporters. Similarly, Jeremy Corbynrsquos plans for rail renationalisation enjoy widespread support, even though it would cost a bomb, the bit that is nationalised already is where most of the problems are, and therersquos no explanation of how nationalising the rest of it would improve things. The Tories, meanwhile, have introduced all sorts of legislation, from stamp duty rises to the sugar tax, which most conservativesregard as profoundly unConservative.Butevery party needs a political narrative ndash evenits actions contradict it ndash what is the story with The Independent Group   When it formed on Monday night, there seemed to be a story of sorts. It was that Mr Corbyn and his supporters are unfit to govern, partly because of their readiness to condone anti-Semitism and all manner of terrorist groups, provided they are anti-Western, and partly because his economic ideas are too left-wing.This narrative was lent extra credence by the readmission to the Labour Party the same day of Derek Hatton. So far, so SDP, which also began as a revolt by Labour MPs against Bennite dominance which rendered the party unelectable for years .But then the story got confused, when three Conservative MPsjoined them. This, it might be thought, ought actually to help Mr Corbyn, by undermining Mrs May. The new group, after all, has one more member than the DUP, which is currently shoring up the government.Read more:Change or more MPs will follow warn new Independent Group membersYet, other than their dislike of their respective partiesrsquo positions on Brexit ndash which all the MPs concerned originally backed, by voting for Article  ndash itrsquos dficult to see what ideas the group has in common. And,there are any, can anyone explain how they might dfer from the policies of the Liberal Democrats There are by chance several other MPs who have become independent either by resigning from their parties or by having the whip withdrawnwho are not in this new group, and show no signs of wanting to join it. And itrsquos not yet clear whether the Independent Group will become a party at all.Assuming that is their intention, however, there are several hard questions for them. And the hardest is not ldquoWhat do you all believe in  or even ldquoHow do you dfer from the Lib Dems  but ldquoWhy do so few people vote for the Lib Dems at the moment  For this is one of the great puzzles of our time.Given that  per cent of the population voted Remain, and that the LibDems are the only UK-wide party to continue to oppose Brexit, you would expect them to be storming the polls. But theyrsquove even managed to lose one of their  MPs . Unsurprisingly, Sir Vince Cable is making ldquocome hither eyes at the new group, but he must also be wondering why none of them considered defecting to his party in the first place.The problem seems to be that the popular appetite for centrism in politics exists largely in the imagination of politicians. Insofar as it exists, judging by the models of Mr Blair and Mr Cameron, as well as the gradual dissolving of the LibDem vote, itrsquos as a desire for one of the two main parties to tack to the centre, rather than an urge to find some new centrist party.Scotland is, of course, in a dferent position because of the SNP which ndash leaving aside its dferent sort of independence ndash governs in the slightly left-of-centre social democratic tradition to which the new group appears to be aligned, and with much the same attitude towards Brexit.As it happens, none of the new grouprsquos MPs represents a Scottish seat. But it would be interesting to know what kind of market there is for a Unionist, anti-Brexit but essentially Blairite kind of party. Instinctively, one imagines that there would be quite a lot of support for such a group. The reality, however, seems to be dferent when the electorate gets into the polling booth. Amazingly, almost  years after its foundation, the SDP still officially exists, separately from the Liberal Democrats. But yoursquod hardly know it.

And, of course, in all of the UKrsquos wearied democratic institutions most notably here at Westminster.The Prime Minister has lost no fewer than  ministers because of it, including two Brexit Secretaries, as well as several others from government and party positions.Labour is not immune.

The official line is that this is not a European Council and Brexit is not formally on the agenda.But it will be on the PMrsquos agenda indeed, it is the only thing on her agenda.The most important conversations she will have will not be with her Arabian counterparts but with the EU powerbrokers also in the Red Sea resort: Germanyrsquos Angela Merkel and the European Councilrsquos Donald Tusk.Mrs May will be hoping, as the Brexit soap opera reaches its nail-biting climax, the Chancellor and the President will help her snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and finally put a Brexit-wearied nation out of its misery."},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

Accessible and affordable transport is a leline for many rural residents, connecting people to opportunities for socialising, working, learning and healthcare. The research in Inverurie will seek to understand the needs of the community in a rural Scottish location, including residents and local businesses and see how current transport services are meeting those needs.Findings will be used to develop and design new services that can be trialled in rural areas.Jenny Milne, from JLM said: “This project provides a great opportunity to understand the challenges travelling to, in and around Inverurie. By working with the community, it will help to understand what transport services are needed, and what steps can then be taken to improve existing routes around the town. “The project also hopes to engage the villages around Inverurie.“By using focus groups and asking the local community about their ideas, it will help to shape rural transport to the benefit of those living in the area.”The project also has support from Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon: “I would urge local residents and businesses in the Inverurie area to take part in this project and make their views known.“Many people depend upon public transport in rural areas – to get to work, to socialise or to keep appointments at local GP and dental surgeries.“We are fortunate in Inverurie to have a train station connecting the town with Aberdeen and Inverness and there has recently been major investment in the line. “However, in more remote parts of Aberdeenshire, public transport is less reliable and frequent.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks. But none of the bombs exploded although they cause a major spillage of oil.Mrs Brown said she understood there were plans to remove some tanks to build houses. She said: ldquoBut it takes time for these sites to be decontaminated from their former industrial uses.In , flats built in Joss Street had to be demolished because the site, which had been formerly used as a gas works, hadnrsquot been properly decontaminated.What do you think  Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupFriday  Feb  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This positioning means that Invergordon receives more cruise passengers than any other port in Scotland, generating over pound million in tourist spend and hundreds of jobs within the wider Highland economy in .

Eyes being the window to the soul and all that. I like to feel the cut of an inidual’s gib before I truly get to know and trust them. None more so that with politicians. But, the opportunity to meet them just does not happen very often. Especially, the more high-profile types where their attendance is all a bit stage managed.However, as I write this piece today you can be assured that I am talking straight from empirical past experience. Over a five-year period, I was exposed –that is the correct term to describe it – to a number of high-profile politicians and their entourage.During these, on many an occasion, intimate affairs, I got to see close up the man or the woman who I had seen on TV the day before or would see tomorrow on TV. Therefore seeing Chuka Umunna and Jeremy Corbyn this week on TV brought back some interesting and emotive memories, as I met them both and spent quite a bit of time with them.“Coffee with Corbyn” can come at a later date as it is Mr Umunna who occupies my thoughts for now. I sat on a  with Chuka. It was a big event at the Glasgow Exhibition Centre. As usual, I arrived early. I like to do this to get a feel for the event, those exhibiting and those who have turned up to hear the speakers. I had a five-minute slot on stage and would then be part of the discussion . It was the headline event. But, just to be clear, it was not a party political event. Chuka Umunna arrived and was brought through to the “green room” where the speakers were kept away from the crowds. It was just me and him for a brief period. He is not what I would call a big man, but he’s fairly athletic and looked like he kept himself pretty fit. He was wearing a sharp, tailored suit, crisp white shirt and he was clean shaven. In fact, it is fair to say he was immaculate. I said hello and shook his hand as he sat down beside me.: Ian Murray: Leadership of our party has pushed too many people to the brinkRushing through my mind and forcing its way into my thoughts, despite my best attempts to block it out, was my deep held perception that he was one of Tony Blair’s boys. In short, a Blairite.And in my book, that did not wash well as ‘Mr Bliar’ – as he is referred to in the George Galloway documentary, the Killing of Tony Blair – was most certainly not on my Christmas card list.But, I did try hard not to let this colour my thinking. We blethered about his journey up from England, then the  presenter, a well-known TV pundit, popped her head in and started gushing. Chuka this and Chuka that. It was like Alan Partridge drooling over a ‘gorgeous blonde’ guest on his clever s satirical talk show, Knowing me, Knowing you.Anyway, by this time, I was most certainly playing second fiddle to Chuka, who with great charm and acceptance, gushed back at the TV pundit. And at this moment, I went off him. Despite being the friendly face who had chatted with him, I was now “in the background” as he ramped up his persona for his keynote and the  discussion.Suffice to say, it all went swimmingly well, the audience seemed happy enough and Chuka and me never saw each other again.But, from that experience and then Chuka’s inept and cringeworthy go at throwing himself in the ring for the Labour Party leadership, I considered him spineless and just a slick-talking young politician who was just like his role model, Teflon Tony. My view of him was as one of those Westminster politicians who lived in the bubble and would stay there safe and secure for years, building up newspaper columns, books and slots on the speaking circuit.Until this week... Bloody Well Done Chuka Umunna!: David Mundell: SNP backing no-deal Brexit to break up UKGranted it has taken you some time to fall out of love with yourself and the Labour Party. But, never say never and it’s never too late to change.Watching Chuka walk out with his fellow Labour MPs, affirming their credentials and being brave, made me stop and think for a while. If I’m being honest, as I watched the live TV broadcast, I felt a bit emotional and wanted to throw my fist in the air with cry of “yes, yes”. Not in any way, shape or form because  MPs had decided Labour was no longer for them or that Westminster politics was “broken”.No, I wanted to fist-pump as I had seen the young and bordering on arrogant politician I sat with, now grown up and being true to himself. I think amazing things could happen now. Chuka Amunna is clever, educated, considerate, experienced and a first-class communicator. But, what is more powerful and signicant is that he can now unleash all of this, in his own way, unbridled by the party whip. Years of frustration and figuring out who he is will now lead to a clear vision of what he truly wants his country and British politics to be like. But, don’t expect it overnight. It will take time and he needs to be supported, challenged and mentored. Notwithstanding, he is now ready and I bet fully prepared and focused on the task that lies ahead of him and his new colleagues.Your father Ben Umunna is not alive Chuka, buthe was here today, I’m sure he’d say one thing.

In fact, this week’s drama has had little,anything, to do with Scotland. The Tory defectors who joined this week talked about the one-nation Tory ideal, but so far, the Independent Group only represents one nation: England.All its MPs are from English constituencies – although the ex-Labour member for Stockport, Ann Coffey, was born in Inverness – and when you ask its members, breathless from endlessly talking about themselves, they don’t have much to say about Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Fair enough: they aren’t a political party, they don’t have any policies, and they haven’t been around for a week yet.Butthe MPs quitting their parties are tapping into something real – a yearning for that cliché of a “dferent kind of politics” – should Scotland be left out Let’s take the Independent Group at face value: part of the motivation for the breakaway is MPs saying “enough” to unrestrained, extreme views in their parties.On that basis, Scotland could do with an Independent Group – according to its own parliamentarians. Many SNP MPs are privately scathing about “zoomers” in their own party, “some of whom have letters after their name”, as one put it. Another suggested they would welcome an early Scottish election as a chance to take on those demanding an immediate independence referendum, and “get them out of the party”. It’s easy to imagine, in the first months of an independent Scotland, a parallel centrist breakaway from the SNP – and the ‘Gang of Seven’ who would lead it.Scottish Labour isn’t a happy political family, either. Some of its most senior figures – Kezia Dugdale, Ian Murray, Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie – are shut out. Listen to the Scottish Tory Paul Masterton talk about a no-deal Brexit and it’s clear he’s as fed up with the ERG, too.: Paris Gourtsoyannis: Breakaway Labour MPs hope for Macron-style rise to powerLet’s be clear: it isn’t going to happen. At least not right away. Constitutional politics and tribalism go hand in hand Scotland knew this before the UK even joined the EU. Both are forces that generally keep people wearing the colours they already have pinned on – and when they do change, the falling out is only bigger.Murray and Sarwar were brought up in Labour, and would only consider leaving in the direst of circumstances. At Westminster, the Scottish Tories are almost all just in the door and several are on track for ministerial jobs. At Holyrood, isions and uneven quality are smoothed over by Ruth Davidson’s brand and the possibility of power.The collapse of Scottish Labour means that for many, the beneficiaries in the Tories and particularly the SNP already fill the role of the insurgent ‘TIG’, as people are calling The Independent Group. Tellingly, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen said: “I didn’t leave the party, it left me.” Identical to Mhairi Black’s words about Labour.Contrary to what outraged Corbyn outriders claim on social media, there has been scrutiny of the contradictions in the Independent Group – we know Anna Soubry thinks George Osborne’s economic policy was “absolutely necessary” because a journalist asked her. Andthere’s a sense of energy, optimism and timeliness around it, it’s inherent in what they’re doing.Listen to Allen and Luciana Berger speak and you can hear repressed anger, hurt and alienation finally being given a voice. Imagine quitting a rubbish job with lots of abusive clients and a senior management that hate you. It’s liberating to escape that kind of unhappiness.: Brexit exposes failings of UK’s political elite – Paris GourtsoyannisWhether they succeed or fail on whatever terms they eventually set themselves, the Independent Group have tapped into something essential about politics today. Voters are less loyal and more sceptical towards establishment politicians and parties – part of the reason why Corbyn is Labour leader at all.In unstable times, people want greater ersity and independence of thought, something reflected in the fragmentation of political groupings across the Western world – a trend that the UK still lags behind in. Part of that is down to the UK’s voting system and constitution on the continent, there is far more experience of coalition-building and cross-party working, which is why the UK’s Brexit deadlock looks so weird viewed from Brussels.Political parties are all coalitions to some extent. Is it really more dficult to imagine a party that unites Anna Soubry and Chris Leslie than one that includes Soubry and Jacob Rees-Mogg  If the Independent Group ends up as a new party, I suspect it will be easier than many predict to develop a policy  that satisfies two branches of continuity Blairism: the former front benches of Ed Miliband and David Cameron.Question their motives, political backgrounds and effectiveness, but the basic principles of the Independent Group are venerable and sound. No less an architect of modern democracy than George Washington warned in his  presidential farewell address that party loyalty would “distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration” and “agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and  alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection”.Look at the state of debate in the country he helped found and the one it split from, and it’s hard to argue.Scotland’s political landscape is already crowded – but it used to be even more so, with room for the Scottish Socialistsand even the Senior Citizens’ Party. In Dennis Canavan and the late, irreplaceable Margo MacDonald, it has also had some of the UK’s most effective independent parliamentarians. When the time comes, Scotland ought to take a good look at independents.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"balallan goalie rachael flies the flag for western isles as part of scotland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Western Isles has a proud footballing heritage, but it#s doubtful that the area has ever featured in a list which also includes Manchester United, Rangers, Celtic, Hibs and Dundee United.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"major road closed following serious collision","story":"Motorists are advised to avoid the Drumcroon Road, Coleraine following a serious two vehicle collision.A PSNI spokesman said ersions are in place.Road closedMotorists are asked to seek an alternative routepossible.Larne Port sponsors well-being business award Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CFER | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CFER | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties.

It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast flight lands safely after declaring midair emergency","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Travelling and residing in the CTAIf you are an Irish citizen living in the UK or a British citizen living in Ireland the Common Travel Areaarrangements allow you to travel freely within the CTA without seeking permission from the authorities.British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in the UK have long held a special status under each country’s national law. If you are an Irish citizen in the UK, you are treated asyou have permanent immigration permission to remain in the UK. This is the sameyou are a British citizen in Ireland: you do not need a visa, any form of residence permit or employment permit. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this continues after the UK leaves the EU.Other nationalities travelling within the CTA remain subject to national immigration requirements. Iniduals arriving in the UK from Ireland should ensure they meet UK immigration requirements. . Working in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen, you can work in either country, including on a self-employed basis, without needing any permission from the authorities.In support of this, the UK Government is committed to ensuring that, after the UK leaves the EU, appropriate and comprehensive provisions continue to be in place for the recognition of professional qualications obtained in Ireland. The Irish Government has also committed to working to ensure the provision of arrangements with the UK to recognise professional qualications. . Accessing education in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen you have the right to access all levels of education in either state on terms no less favourable than those available to the citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this continues after the UK leaves the EU.Both Governments have also committed to taking steps to ensure that British and Irish citizens pursuing further and higher education in the other state will continue to have the right to qualy for student loans and support under applicable schemes and eligibility conditions. . Accessing social security benefits in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen residing or working in the other’s state, working in both states or working across the border you are subject to only one state’s social security legislation at a time. You can access social security benefits and entitlements, including pensions, from whichever state you are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where you are living.When working in the CTA, you pay into only one state’s social security scheme at a time and are entitled, when in the other state, to the same social security rights, and are subject to the same obligations, as citizens of that state.You also have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of the state you are in. The UK and Irish Governments have concluded a bilateral agreement to ensure that these rights will continue to be protected after the UK leaves the EU. Further information about that agreement can be found here. . Accessing health care in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen you have the right to access health care in either state. When visiting you also have the right to access needs-arising health care during your stay. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue after the UK leaves the EU. . Accessing social housing support in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen residing in the other state you have the right to access social housing, including supported housing and homeless assistance, on the same basis as citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue after the UK leaves the EU. . Voting rights in the CTAIf you are a British or Irish citizen living in the other state you are entitled to register to vote with the relevant authorities for local and national parliamentary elections in that state on the same basis as citizens of that state. Upon reaching voting age, you are entitled to vote in those elections on the same basis as citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to ensuring that these arrangements will continue after the UK leaves the EU. . a. Irish citizens and the EU Settlement SchemeIf you are an Irish citizen in the UK you do not need to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme but you may do soyou wish.You do not need to do anything to protect your status in the UK, either before or after the UK leaves the EU. You will continue to be able to enter and reside in the UK and to enjoy your existing rights as provided for by the CTA arrangements.If you are an Irish citizen and want to support an application from existing non-Irish and non-UK family members who want to remain in the UK with you, or who wish to join you in the future, you will need to be able to prove that you were resident in the UK prior to  December . There will be many ways to do this without you applying to the Settlement Scheme, but a grant of status under the Scheme would constitute such evidence. . b. Irish citizens with non-Irish non-British family membersThe arrangements for existing close family membersto remain in the UK with, or join EU citizens resident in the UK in future, are not provided for by the CTA arrangements but rather under the draft Withdrawal Agreement.Non-Irish and non-British citizen family members of Irish citizens who wish to remain in the UK with, or join an Irish citizen in the UK in future, will be required to apply for a status under the EU Settlement Scheme. The Scheme allows eligible family members to obtain a status even where the Irish citizen has chosen not to do so. In those circumstances, the family member simply needs to provide evidence of the Irish citizen’s identity and nationality, of their relationship to the Irish citizen and of their continuous residence in the UK.If you are an Irish citizen and choose to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme, the application process is the same as for any other EU citizen applicant.If you do not apply to the EU Settlement Scheme you will still be able to draw on the protection of the draft Withdrawal Agreement to be joined in the UK by close family members of another nationality. You might wish to consider retaining documents such as payslips, bank statements, utility bills, tenancy agreements or other dated documents which display your UK address, as these are the types of evidence that will be required in support of a future application to be joined by a close family member."},{"url":null,"title":"opposition claims ireland not prepared for nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is not a satisfactory situation.Mr Billy McGivern, the Executiversquos area manager, admitted to councillors he was not happy with the situation in Ballynahinch and explained what had gone wrong with the Antrim Road site where  new homes were to have been built.ldquoWe did get planning permission for the site, he said. ldquoWe dug trial holes and the ground was satisfactory, but we were overtaken by discussions between the landowner and a private developer. The Housing Executive could not go through with a vesting order where a private developer is going ahead to build low cost housing.Mr McGivern promised that the Executive would press very strongly for sites in Ballynahinch and would be meeting with local planners in an attempt to come up with an answer.Ballynahinch councillor Mr Eddie McVeigh agreed there were problems obtaining sites, but he pointed out that the town was not scheduled for any new homes until - and he wanted other sites investigated as soon as possible.Cllr William Brown felt the now abandoned Antrim Road site was not all it was supposed to be anyway and it would have been foolish to proceed with a site which would have flooded, as it had done in the past.Cllr Francis Laverty wanted to know how the Executive could justy giving houses in Ballynahinch to people from Drumaness.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick firemen had another busy week, during which they attended several gorse fires and a chimney fire.On Saturday they were called to a gorse fire near Irish Street and the previous day they attended a Gorse Fire at Gallows Hill.On Thursday they were called out three times. The first was in the morning to St Johnrsquos Old Peoplersquos Home in Pound Lane, but they were not needed as the fire alarm had gone off accidentally.KILLOUGH mdash Killough Village Committee is pressing the Housing Executive to repair extensive storm damage caused to houses during the Christmas period.Damage caused to several of the new houses in the Castle Street area was one of the main problems discussed at a meeting of the committee recently.ldquoSerious storm damage to the roofs occurred, especially over the Christmas period, and this has not been fixed, the committee claims.ldquoLetters were sent to the Housing Executive and the contractor. The Executive sent a clerk of works to meet the contractorrsquos men at an arranged time, but they didnrsquot turn up, the committee said.ldquoThe occupants are very annoyed about this lack of interest and are now awaiting immediate action before dampness causes more serious damage.The committee has also hit out at the delay in truing to prove the ownership of the village harbour. They say it has ldquogone beyond a joke and intend sending a delegation to Down Council in a bid of finally resolve the ownership question.ldquoNothing can be done to start work on the sadly neglected harbour area until the present owner is contacted and public ownership is established. We firmly intend to pursue this matter until work has begun, the committee added.In the evening they attended a gorse fire on the Saul Road and several hours later they attended a chimney fire at Bobbie Hanveyrsquos photographic shop in Irish Street.ARDGLASS mdash Local planners have been asked to keep watch on a dredging operation currently underway at Ardglass harbour.The call has come from Down Council chairman Eddie McGrady, who is concerned not so much about the dredging but what is happening to the materials being taken from the harbour.Local councillor Dermot Curran is also concerned. He said that a tipping operation at the rear of the Seaview estate has not been properly maintained mdash much to the disgust of residents.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Three pupils from Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have won a Raleigh Boxer bicycle in a national lsquoWheels Projectrsquo open to Tufty Clubs.The bicycle, which will be used by the Tufty Club members at the school, was the top price in the - years section of the competition which was organised by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.Members of the schoolrsquos Tufty Club entered the competition, but it was the entries of Jason McKeown, Paul Beattie and Paul Chambers that clinched the top prize.COMBER mdash Comber police are investigating a number of thefts which took place in the town over the past week.Thieves entered the Rle Club in Railway Street and took away away a number of bottles of spirits on Wednesday evening.

We really are in need of fund raising from the public to help keep us going.Glebe House manager Diarmaid McGarrigle blames the rise in student overheads as one reason for the shortage of dedicated volunteers, calling it a ldquopoor indictment on our society.Mr McGarrigle said up until a few years ago Glebe House benefited from a ldquoteam of dedicated, driven and enthusiastic helpers.He said that is no longer the case because students were now having to seek paid employment to cover tuition fees and other costs.ldquoIt is a shame because young groups need volunteers from their own peer group to relate to, he explained.ldquoWe can offer volunteers a wide iety of skills to choose from as we have  acres of farm land, animals to look after and an environment to plan and maintain. We also run lots of arts and crafts, cookery and games-centred projects.ldquoAll we are looking for in a volunteer is someone who is dedicated to the aims and objectives of Glebe House and its projects.ldquoInthey will receive training in which ever area they choose to work, a lot of camaraderie and the opportunity to meet new friends.ldquoOne of the most rewarding aspects of working at Glebe House for me is seeing children we have helped come back as volunteers years later.

The centrepiece of the celebrations was a specially baked cake.Mrs Hilman has seen huge changes over the past four decades, including progressing from a manual typewriter and maintaing a hand written register to a state-of-the art computer system with touch-type keyboards and scanners.However, one thing that remains the same is the children, who are as much an inspiration today as they were when she first walked into the school.Mrs Hilman began working as secretary in  when Mr James McIlhinney was the principal.

He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well.

He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago.

He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

You canrsquot keep putting everything in the same place.ldquoThe Welsh Government seem hell bent with concreting every last bit of land in the whole of Wales.ldquoWe canrsquot keep swamping the same areas that canrsquot cope with the traffic and lack of services with house after house.ldquoItrsquos sheer madness.Asbri Planning, which is drawing up the plans along with Austin Smith: Lord Architects, has applied to the Vale council for a scoping opinion as to whether the new homes would have a signicant impact on the environment, and therefore need an environmental impact assessment.Councillor Jonathan Bird, Vale of Glamorgan Council cabinet member for regeneration and planning, said:ldquoNo planning application has yet been submitted, rather there have been screening and scoping submissions. These will be considered in accordance with the relevant legislation and guidance, part of which specically relates to the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment.ldquoShould a planning application follow, it will be considered in exactly the same way as any other of its type. In order to gain approval, among other factors, it will need to satisfy national and local policies, including those contained in the LDP, while members of the public will also have the opportunity to express their views before any decision is taken.Welsh Government and the architects have been contacted for comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.PSNI warn of children staggering about drunk or choking on their own vomit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.
