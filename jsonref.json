Voyager was cut in half and sunk with the loss of 82 lives.But Hagerty, now 71, has found the courage to reveal what he believes is crucial evidence of a cover-up of the true cause of Australia’s worst peacetime disaster.Hagerty believes the collision was caused by a faulty course-and-speed order given by the Voyager’s officer of the watch, Lt David Price, a British naval officer on secondment to the Royal Australian Navy. Price went down with the ship.After the collision, Hagerty says, he was was taken to Sydney’s naval base HMAS Watson and cowed into silence by its captain, British officer Capt Ian Easton, also on secondment. Hagerty maintains Easton systematically challenged his recollections and intimidated him into withholding evidence at the first royal commission into the disaster. Easton, now deceased, later attained the rank of admiral in the British navy and was knighted for his service.Hagerty was the only survivor of the three men in the wheelhouse of the ship who heard and responded to the final course-and-speed orders given to them in the seconds before the collision. Hagerty, a member of the HMAS Voyager Survivors Association, is the second survivor to talk to Guardian Australia. Radio operator Allan Hellier was motivated to clear the name of Captain Duncan Stephens, saying he had borne unfair criticism and could not defend himself because he died in the collision. The inquiry into the disaster heard that Stephens was frequently drunk and unfit to be in command of the ship, and on the night of the accident had ordered a triple brandy from his steward.Hellier revealed for the first time publicly that it was he who drank the triple brandy the captain had ordered for him 90 minutes before the collision because he thought it would help his upset stomach.When contacted by Guardian Australia, Hegarty also wanted to correct the record about his captain, and agreed he had been unfairly criticised.“The captain was a lovely skipper,” he said. “He was a good man. He was a fair man.”As the Melbourne struck the Voyager amidships, Hagerty was lucky to survive because the wheelhouse of Voyager was on the edge of the direct path of the Melbourne as she cut through the smaller vessel.The enormous force of the impact rolled the Voyager on to its side, forcing the wheelhouse suddenly under water. The three men in the wheelhouse were standing no more than a few feet apart but Hagerty does not know what happened to his fellow crewmen. Both died in the disaster.Hagerty’s memories are clear but recalling them and speaking about what happened still causes him to experience the feelings of the terrifying moment when he thought he would die.“I heard a bang,” Hagerty said. “The ship turned over. The lights in the wheel house went out. The wheelhouse was instantly full of water.“The ship was lying on its side and the wheelhouse was under water ... I had cut hands. It was dark, underwater. The ship must have been underwater quite a way for the wheelhouse to be flooded.”His legs were scratched on the back but he could swim. “I saw light above me while I was still under the water,” he said. “I went towards the light. “The next minute I was on the surface of the ocean. I don’t know how I got there.” A lifeboat from the Melbourne picked up Hagerty from the ocean and he was able to climb the boarding nets up the side of the aircraft carrier despite his injuries.Once he had showered and was given clothes, he was taken aside and asked to write down his recollection of what happened because he had been at an important location on the ship at the time of the collision.He was given a pen and paper to make notes within two hours of the disaster.The Daring-class destroyer was constructed with the wheelhouse in the centre of the ship under the bridge to protect the ship’s steering in case of enemy attack.Sailors in the wheelhouse therefore had no windows and those at the helm had no situational awareness of the vessel on the ocean and had to rely on instructions spoken down a voice tube from the bridge of the ship. In addition, the ship’s radar was in the operations room on the floor above the wheelhouse, so there was no electronic indication of their position in relation to other ships. “In the wheelhouse you do what you are told from the bridge – you don’t ask. You can’t see,” Hagerty said. “In front of you is an instrument like a sun clock with an arrow and, as you turn the wheel, the arrow turns as well.“All I know was we were looking for a wind to come over the Melbourne’s bow so the planes could take off easier with the wind under their wings.”Hagerty’s notes document the names of the three men in the wheelhouse: himself (ordinary seaman Degenhardt, he has since taken his father’s surname, Hagerty) leading seaman Frank Sharkey and able seaman Stanley Hale.Hagerty noted the engine doing 160 revolutions per minute and that at 8.45pm Hale had the wheel and that “every minute” Hale was given orders to change the course and speed.Hagerty wrote that at 8.50pm they were given the order to steer 15 degrees to starboard and then, almost immediately, to steer 10 degrees to port.He then records there were no orders given for two or three minutes.Unbeknown to him the ships were closing in on each other. Hagerty then records that 10 seconds before the collision he heard the officer of the watch, British naval officer Price, “screaming out”.Hagerty then heard the captain call out “What the fuck’s he done now?” but he only wrote down the captain’s order: “Full ahead both. Both engines.” This recollection was verified by two other survivors who heard the captain’s words through the voice pipe connected to the wheelhouse.Survivors of the disaster were taken to Sydney on HMAS Melbourne and were given one week’s leave. Hagerty, 17, went home to Newcastle where he had grown up in the busy port city and had dreamed of a life at sea. Once he returned to duty the following week, Hagerty was assigned to the navy’s new hydrographic survey ship, HMAS Moresby, in preparation for her commissioning in March 1964.He was having nightmares about the disaster but was not given medical help. Instead, a sick-berth attendant told him to “go ashore and drink some beer” so he could sleep at night.Soon after Hagerty was separated from his fellow crewmen and posted to HMAS Watson, the royal Australian navy training base at South Head on Sydney harbour.Here the captain of HMAS Watson, British officer Easton, spoke to the 17-year-old each day, challenging his recollection of the events leading to the collision and putting to him a different scenario of events.Hagerty has told Guardian Australia that he was angry that his evidence was challenged.Hagerty said when he appeared at the royal commission his version of events was brought into question by the government barrister who had knowledge of his conversations with Easton. The 17-year-old capitulated under duress. He was not called to give evidence at the second royal commission.Hagerty was discharged medically unfit from the navy at the age of 20 and given an invalid pension.More than 50 years on, Hagerty wants his Voyager captain exonerated.“I want the blame put where it belongs,” he said.Hagerty believes Price’s inexperience partially led to the disaster.Price had joined the Royal navy in 1952 working on minesweepers and small vessels and had experience of manoeuvres in which vessels turn together but he had not worked on a destroyer. He joined Voyager’s crew on 2 January 1964, less than five weeks before the collision. Hagerty believes Easton deliberately intimidated him to deflect blame for the disaster from a fellow British officer.Although he survived the disaster, Hagerty says the trauma he experienced has affected him throughout his life.“I’m alive but I didn’t survive,” he said. “The lucky ones are the ones who died that night because they’ve not had 54 years of survivor guilt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"patient x the case book of ryunosuke akutagawa review","story":"‘The Case-Book of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa’ presents 12 scenes from the life of the writer known as the father of the Japanese short storyWe expect biographies to portray events in the real lives of real people we expect novels to portray imaginary events in the lives of imaginary people. David Peace is not a writer who obeys the usual conventions and assumptions: his work defies expectations.Peace is best known for the Red Riding quartet, his ferocious series of novels set against the backdrop of the Yorkshire Ripper murders, and for his football novel The Damned Utd, the only truly great novel ever likely to be written about Brian Clough. He has lived for most of his adult life in Tokyo and several of his most recent works have been about post-second world war Japan. His new book engages with Japan in an entirely new and unexpected way. Patient X: The Case-Book of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is a novel composed of 12 stories which retell incidents from the life and work of the writer who lived from 1892 to 1927 and is often referred to as the father of the Japanese short story he is renowned in the west as the author of “In a Grove”, which was the basis for Akira Kurosawa’s film Rashōmon.As a portrait of a very particular kind of artist – the tormented genius, obsessed with the nature of the self and the impossibility of true self-knowledge and self-depiction – the book is accurate and profoundly revealing. Raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother’s mental breakdown, Akutagawa grows up timid and afraid – “Afraid of the doors, afraid of the floors” – and becomes a bookish teenager inhabiting a “secondhand world of words”, with a life that is “always, already secondhand, secondhand”. He seeks out friendships and relationships with other Japanese writers – Jun’ichirō Tanizaki, Natsume Sōseki – and becomes immersed in the literatures of both east and west, drawn towards doppelgangers and figures of uncanny, unexplained encounters. (In his introduction to Jay Rubin’s standard English translation of Akutagawa’s work, Rashōmon and Seventeen Other Stories, published in 2006, Haruki Murakami pays tribute to Akutagawa’s work, which has clearly influenced his own.)One of the most complex and memorable stories in the book, the phantasmagoric “Jack the Ripper’s Bedroom”, is an imagining of Sōseki’s famously miserable time spent in London, as retold to Akutagawa. Dense with literary allusions, the story reads like something by Edgar Allan Poe set in Edwardian London with a Japanese protagonist, and concludes with a nod and a wink to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. With Patient X, one begins to see that Peace’s achievement is not merely as an English prose stylist, or as someone who merges genres, or indeed even as a political writer challenging what appears to be the natural order, but as a transnational figure challenging all categories of containment.To buy Patient X for £12.74 go to guardianbookshop.com."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d35cceb0a400420be0a1881b521c322df19193/0_282_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=58f9c6abfcf34fea33c60c9997951993 1240w","title":"bestway jobs deal bargain booze owner conviviality","story":"Wine Rack and Bargain Booze rescued from brink by wholesaler in £7m dealAbout 2,000 jobs are set to be saved with the buyout of retail chains Wine Rack and Bargain Booze in a £7m deal.The retail ision of troubled drinks group Conviviality has been acquired by grocery wholesaler Bestway in a pre-pack administration process, which allows the buyer to cherry pick a collapsed company’s best assets at a bargain price.The deal was completed just before midnight on Friday.Matthew Callaghan, partner at PwC, said: “This deal safeguards the jobs of more than 2,000 employees, ensures franchisees have the ability to continue to trade and creates some much-needed stability for business customers and the sector in general. “Alongside the sale of Conviviality’s Direct business earlier this week, the total number of staff whose jobs have been protected stands at more than 4,000.”Bestway, which was founded and is chaired by the billionaire Sir Anwar Pervez, is one of Britain’s biggest food wholesalers serving thousands of retailers it also owns the Well pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014.Conviviality announced its intention to appoint administrators last week after a string of profit warnings and the discovery of a £30m tax bill, putting more than 2,600 jobs at risk.On Wednesday, Magners owner C\u0026ampC bought Conviviality’s wholesale arm through a pre-pack administration. The Irish cider giant bought wholesalers Matthew Clark, Bibendum, Catalyst, Peppermint, Elastic and Walker \u0026amp Wodehouse for a nominal sum. Stella Artois and Budweiser maker AB InBev is also supporting the deal. PwC handled the sale and administration process.Conviviality’s retail arm operates more than 800 stores under brands including chains Select Convenience, Central Convenience and Wine Rack as well as Bargain Booze, many of which are run by independent franchisees.The breakup of Conviviality marks the end of the firm after rapid demise over just a few weeks. The company blamed the first shock profit warning on a spreadsheet arithmetic error made by a member of its finance team and weakening profit margins and then admitted it had not budgeted for the £30m tax bill due at the end of March.Conviviality issued a third profit warning as it admitted it needed to ask investors for new funding of £125m to avoid going bust, but failed to convince them of its long-term future. Former investors in Conviviality are considering a lawsuit after raising questions over the company’s strategy in making a string of rapid acquisitions, including the recent purchase of more than 100 Central Convenience stores from the collapsed Palmer \u0026amp Harvey business.Meanwhile, the chair of parliament’s work and pensions committee, Frank Field, has questioned the role of the auditor KPMG."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f418d1af33e22942422b00d707fa39e63a471f15/0_2458_5191_3114/master/5191.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39bb8abb03b06700c946d5e8cabd0a57 1240w","title":"east end small business artist relocate eailway arch rent rise","story":"Spiralling rents are driving growing numbers of artists and small businesses out of London’s East End, with the problem expected to spread to other cities around the UK.In many cases, traders are being replaced by cafes and workspaces designed for people working on laptops.Of those that remain, many are struggling for survival, as business rates also went up substantially last year for the first time in seven years.Frances Northrop of the New Economics Foundation says: “Imagine London without the small businesses of Portobello Road, Brick Lane, Columbia Road and Chinatown. They are being driven out by the cold logic of ever-increasing rents.”Many small independent businesses are based in railway arches across London, often owned by Network Rail or Transport for London.Network Rail has almost 4,500 arches across the country, with two-thirds of those in London. Transport for London, meanwhile, owns about 2,000 commercial units across London.Derec Hickman of Chu’s Garage in Hackney, who runs the Guardians of the Arches, a group that is open to traders in the rest of the UK, says: “The action is spreading from London to other cities. What’s happening to us will happen to them.”Five of his neighbours are looking to leave, and one trader has already moved out of the arches due to the crippling rent increases.The EETG is proposing a London working rent: an affordable formula for small and micro-businesses akin to the London living rent, and has received backing from the mayors of Hackney and Tower Hamlets.The New Economics Foundation is in the process of working out a formula. Guardian Money spoke to a number of small businesses affected by the rent hikes.The bespoke furniture maker was one of the first tenants at Bayford Street Industrial Units in Hackney, built by the Greater London Council in the 1980s to attract local business and jobs to a then-run down area.This year, unable to meet the now private landlord’s demands to double the rent, Poetstyle, with its 15 furniture makers, moved to Hainault, on the border of London and Essex. Managing director Charlie Fox says it has just moved out of its second workshop in a railway arch in Hackney after facing a similar rent hike there.He says Network Rail originally asked for £31 per sq ft, which was then reduced to £18 until September, but going up to £24 thereafter. He was originally paying £14.“It’s not really viable,” he says. “It is tough, ever since Brexit, but I just can’t hike the price of a sofa because I’m up against cheap imports.”Sarah Haque and her son launched their company in 2004 in Cheshire Street, Shoreditch, to create and sell T-shirts and other products designed by London and UK-based artists.Their business rate has gone up from £1,100 to £16,000 a year, while the annual rent charged by their private landlord is rising to £29,000 plus VAT in a stepped five-year increase, compared with £8,500 in 2006. No improvements have been made to the space, she says.Haque says she had to reduce her staff from 10 to four. “It’s very, very sad because we’ve been here more than 10 years and it’ll be sad to leave. We can’t increase our business, we are late in paying the rent and late in paying salaries. It’s just a mess.”Best known for its laser-cut Perspex jewellery, Tatty Devine is run by Rosie Wolfenden and Harriet Vine, who founded the business together in 1999, and were awarded MBEs for services to the fashion industry in 2013.They opened a shop in London’s Brick Lane in 2000 – but Wolfenden says the shop rent has quadrupled since then.“It’s getting to the point where it’s unaffordable,” she says. “It’s driving out so many creatives from Hackney or Tower Hamlets. A lot have gone to Kent, to Margate.”She notes that there are lot of empty shops in east London.Wolfenden adds: “If we were to inflate our prices to match the rent and rate rises, we would go out of business.”She says the business is surviving because it includes retail, wholesale and e-commerce, and could not have been set up in the same location if she and Vine were starting it today.The MOT garage in a railway arch in London Fields, east London, was founded by Quang Chu 30 years ago.He is battling a rent increase from Network Rail, his landlord, which originally wanted to hike the rent from £18,000 to £38,000 (or £35,000 if the garage gave up its secured tenancy).Network Rail is now asking for a stepped increase to £26,500 in the first year, going up to £34,000 in the third year, says the firm.Ten other traders in the arches were put under the same pressure, says Derec Hickman, who married into the Vietnamese family that founded Chu’s Garage.The garage and one other trader are due to go to arbitration, where the rent will be set by independent assessors.What the owners sayOn the claim that it is hiking rents in order to pocket a bigger profit from the sale of property, it says “this is completely untrue. Any reviews are part of business-as-usual activity. The sale will be based on past performance and receipts of the estate over a number of years”.Transport for LondonGraeme Craig, director of commercial development, says: “We are committed to encouraging erse, small businesses as vital to London’s economy. Our leases are flexible … and we are working with Tower Hamlets and Hackney and the EETG to explore how we might change our policies to allow smaller businesses to continue to flourish on our estate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80f25e360f51a2c5b05cb2f08853ae42c1744d5/0_98_4614_2769/master/4614.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4dcb7daab55952ef35113ef36a5dcaa4 1240w","title":"fresh blow for airbus as boeing wins 12bn jet order from american airlines","story":"The deal for wide-bodied aircraft is the latest in a series of setbacks for the European manufacturer’s A330neo aircraftBoeing has won a crucial contest to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets to American Airlines, beating European rival Airbus for the highly coveted order of wide-body, long-haul aircraft.“This was a difficult decision between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 and A330neo and we thank both manufacturers for their aggressive efforts to earn more of American’s business. In the end, our goal to simplify our fleet made the 787 a more compelling choice,” American Airlines president Robert Isom said in a statement.The deal, at a list price of more than $12bn, is the latest in a series of blows to the Airbus A330neo. It comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines dropped an order for six of the jets in favor of the 787, leaving that variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers. “This new order is a powerful endorsement of the 787 family’s unique passenger appeal and unmatched ability to help airlines open new routes and grow profitably,” Boeing chief executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement. Reuters had previously reported that Boeing was primed to emerge triumphant in the hard-fought widebody contest, bringing along in its victory engine maker General Electric, whose engines are expected to power the Boeing aircraft.

Can the reopening of its famous gondola ride finally heal old wounds?Pazite, Snajper! – Beware, Sniper! – warned the signs along the Sarajevo street exposed to marksmen looking through their rifle viewfinders from the top of Mount Trebević. People would sprint from one side of “sniper’s alley” to the other to deliver supplies to family and friends – death hot on their heels. The hillside where tens of thousands used to spend their Saturdays before the 1992-1996 siege of Sarajevo soon became “a symbol of aggression”, recalls mountain guide Fikret Kahrovic. “Trebević was the only place to breathe fresh air when the city was engulfed in fumes, but that all changed and the mountain became our enemy.”Today – 26 years after the siege began and 73 years since the city’s second world war liberation – Sarajevo hopes to put much of that past to rest with the reopening of the Trebević gondola.The 33 cabins will variously sport the Bosnian flag and the colours of the Olympics, a reminder of the mountain’s role in the 1984 Winter Games. It will follow the same route as the previous cable car, travelling from the old town to the lungs of Sarajevo, Trebević, which rises majestically above the city.After Bosnia-Herzegovina’s declaration of independence on 3 March 1992, the guard on the old Trebević gondola, Ramo Biber, became the first victim of the war. He was shot dead as the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army continued their campaign to encircle Sarajevo and capture key positions. Four weeks later, on 5 April, the 1,425-day siege of the city started – the longest blockade of a capital in modern history.Hundreds of mortars and countless bullets rained down on Sarajevo from this point, killing a large proportion of the 11,541 people slain in the city during the period. Gunfire was a fixture of daily life for more than three years.In August 1995, following mortar attacks that killed dozens of civilians and provoked widespread international condemnation, Nato finally intervened and began strategic bombing of the artillery encampments on Trebević. The Bosnian Serbs were forced into retreat and the Dayton Peace Agreement soon followed, splitting the nation into two largely autonomous entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska – along ethnic lines.The boundary line between the two skirts the mountain and disagreements between Federation and Republic on redevelopment meant Trebević became a ghost town. The remains of destroyed restaurants, hotels, sports facilities and mountain huts were left to rot and the thousands of mines were cleared at a painstakingly slow pace. Bandits roamed the hills, attacking hiking groups and tourists visiting the bobsleigh tracks with seeming impunity.“We believed that if we liberated Trebević we would be free,” recalls Kahrovic. “But even after the war ended returning to the mountain was like a nightmare. Serb artillery positions had been everywhere and there were still minefields until just a few years ago.”In the past few years, however, the mountain has slowly returned to something like its former self. Hotels, restaurants and cafes have been rebuilt, mines swept away and hikers from all over Sarajevo visit en masse. For many, the return of the gondola is the final step in this restoration. Despite some frustration that it took so long, with many blaming an endemic culture of corruption, there is a palpable sense of optimism around the reopening.Sarajevans, Bosnians, Herzegovinians and tourists alike will start the nine-minute, 2km gondola ride in Sarajevo, in the Federation, and arrive on Trebević’s plateau, a stone’s throw away from Republika Srpska where much of the mountain, including its peak, sits.“The gondola will be used by everyone, which I think is very important for future generations to grow up with,” says a young Bosnian woman, who preferred not to be named. “Though we cannot recreate the same spirit of Sarajevo from those times, we are creating our own memories, while still being influenced by the legends of our elders, such as Trebević, the giant that looms over our city.”Another described the gondola as a bittersweet memorial to another life. “It might be just a gondola, but only for those who have never had a wound that entirely stops your breathing.”There has been some uncertainty over the price of journeys on the gondola. Altogether, the construction cost around 20 million marks (£8.9m) – one of the country’s largest postwar infrastructure projects – and has been years in the making. A sizeable proportion of the funds came from philanthropic donations.Eventually, it was decided a return ticket would cost six marks. The mayor, Abdulah Skaka, said: “I will not allow the gondola to be only for the elite. It belongs to all citizens of Sarajevo, and Trebević is our biggest nature park.”Foreigners will pay 20 marks, almost three and a half times more. That is still significantly cheaper than similar attractions in Europe, says Skaka.While shrapnel from exploded mortar shells is still embedded in Sarajevo’s pavements and bullet holes pepper the facade of its buildings, the wreckage of the previous gondola has been swept aside and the sense of optimism has been immortalised in a song written and performed to mark the occasion.“A new youth is coming,” sing members of the Sarajevo pop band Ambasadori. “The gates of the city remember our steps, the old lift moans, slowly climbing to the sky under the clouds.

Unicef and others do impressive work on tight budgets but they need more support from usExhausted parents dragging toddlers through water and mud, babies carried in the arms of siblings little older than themselves, and horrifyingly tiny graves of children who did not survive the journey.This is the confronting scene we witnessed in January at the Rohingya refugee settlements surrounding Cox’s Bazar on our visit to South-East Bangladesh as co-chairs of the parliamentary friends of Unicef.At the time we were told 80,000 people needed shifting in 60 days so they would not be killed by mudslides. They needed adequate drainage so that waterborne and respiratory diseases wouldn’t flourish and spread in the additional water as it mixed with excrement. And as the monsoon season approaches, the challenge is about to get much worse for almost one million Rohingya refugees.At Cox’s Bazar, we witnessed the work Unicef and other humanitarian agencies have been doing to help this enormous influx of desperate people in incredibly difficult circumstances. We saw there was no waste.We saw the impressive level of work that was completed on tight budgets – the digging of hundreds of water bore wells, installation of thousands of latrines, immunisation of 900,000 children and adults against cholera, screening of over a quarter of a million children for malnutrition, construction of learning and play spaces. One of the very basic things people need in order to survive is hope, but how does anyone offer hope in this situation? Especially as there is no right to hope, no matter how much you need it or wish for it.Freedom of movement for these people remains highly restricted, and they have extremely limited access to the fundamentals of existence – health care, education and the ability to earn a livelihood – whether or not they are trying to leave Bangladesh to return to the state of Rakhine in Myamar. They are stateless. Their nationality is denied.Australia must do everything it can to convince or pressure the Myanmar government to respect the rights of its Rohingya population, so that they can return to their homes as fully fledged citizens safely and with dignity as soon as possible. Unfortunately, this option currently seems far off, so we must face the present reality that this is a long-term stay for this huge and unfortunate population of people. So the Bangladesh government and authorities deserve enormous recognition for the assistance and aid they have provided to these people. Aid organisations from Bangladesh and around the world have managed to avert the worst of disasters so far.However, the changing seasons are about to deliver further suffering upon the already highly traumatised population that has fled to Bangladesh. They are still trying to recover from the psychological effects of the violence they have fled, and they are still trying to adapt to the harsh and unsanitary conditions in the monstrous camp cities that have sprung up to accommodate them. Now they must prepare for the onset of the monsoon, cyclone and flood season.Many of the areas housing the essential services are likely to become flooded in the very near future. Access to health, education and child protection services will be considerably diminished for this Perth-sized population.That is why we will continue to advocate in parliament and to the Australian people for urgent assistance to Bangladesh – with the necessary financial and other resources to support them through the dire months ahead as the monsoons and the floods sweep in.We firmly believe we must all work toward providing our Rohingya neighbours with the human dignity and basic rights that should never be negotiable. We must be good neighbours. And the first step to doing this must surely be to give them hope.• Lisa Singh is a Labor Senator for Tasmania and Andrew Broad MP is a Nationals Member for Mallee.

That a foreign leader broke off from allegedly fiddling his election to publicly say so might be regarded as brass neck of the worst order – but accuracy matters. The one does not excuse the other. It was entirely right that the comment was withdrawn, and the MasterChef judge Gregg Wallace going on telly to clarify what he meant about the rendang saucechicken skin interaction belatedly went some way to de-escalating the diplomatic fallout with, among others, the Malaysian prime minister.I know what you’re thinking: how many dodgy foreign leaders are going to accuse the Brits of substance-related disinformation this year? Are these things cheaper in bulk? All I can tell you is that, while artisan greengrocer Gregg Wallace has vaguely conceded his cock-up, artisan foreign secretary Boris Johnson is still trying to style his out in the face of having needlessly handed Russia a propaganda coup. Having previously said that “the guy” at Porton Down had told him there was “no doubt” the novichok nerve agent used in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, was made in Russia, the Foreign Office has had to offer a more nuanced version of the evidential trail.Clearly, Boris’s needless overstatement was a gift to troll tsar Putin, whose known modus operandi is to encourage and seed multiple doubts and conspiracy theories about any Russia-related misdeeds until the factual environment is more toxically polluted than one of the reactor ghost towns the Soviets forgot to admit to.Meanwhile, the Russian ambassador to the UN was channelling former KGB bleeding-heart Putin directly on Thursday, when he posed a plangent inquiry about the Skripal pets. “What happened to these animals? Why doesn’t anyone mention them?” he mentioned, stopping just shy of demanding Ace Ventura be seconded to the OPCW investigation.What happened, alas, has just emerged. The two guinea pigs were not victims of novichok, which would have made them a guesstimated 350,001st and 350,002nd of their species to succumb to a nerve agent, though probably the first pair in a domestic setting. Instead, the poor things were killed by thirst, having been sealed inside the Skripals’ house by investigators. The cat was in such a distressed state when a vet eventually gained entry that it was euthanised, reportedly at Porton Down.This is some way from a typical case of animal neglect, though for many of Britain’s 5 million armchair Hans Blixes, the pets’ fate will be inexcusable. It should certainly be more than enough for Labour’s Chris Williamson to take his Lord Hawski-Hawski act on Russian TV again. Don’t worry if you missed the Derby North MP’s sombre-suited explanation that the Skripal\u0026nbspstory was the British government’s “way of erting attention from their own difficulties over Brexit and economic policy”. It’ll be played on a grateful\u0026nbsploop across Russian state media for days – as a\u0026nbspway of erting attention from their own difficulties, funnily enough.Idiots gonna idiot. It’s just a shame that foreign secretaries won’t foreign secretary. You hear a lot about post-truth these days, but with each new sack-resistant balls-up, Boris Johnson moves closer to the category of post-shame. He’s a sort of market knock-off of Prince Philip – Le Shark Sportif of not really giving a toss. The foreign secretary who feels less shame and takes less grownup responsibility for himself than Gregg Wallace. Gregg Wallace! I mean, Gregg is the guy who “couldn’t get to the bottom” of one of his former wives’ claim that he was “needy”. “I find it all weird,” he mused. “I mean, she came up to the flat in London last week to change my sheets.”Once again it will be up to Theresa May and various Swat mandarins to change Boris’s bed after the latest shitting thereof. Obviously it would stay classified for decades, but perhaps Whitehall might undertake a time-and-motion study to evaluate precisely how much Foreign Office time is spent dealing with cock-ups by the foreign secretary. It is difficult to think of anyone more loftily dismissive of the central demands of their role, certainly since Hristo Stoichkov got the Celta Vigo job and used his unveiling to announce: “I do not believe in tactics.” His tenure … did not go well.It’s remarkable, incidentally, how often the foreign secretary is undone by language. For a man who wears his vast vocabulary so heavily, Boris struggles for lexical precision when it actually matters. He can lavish who knows how much time coming up with the mot juste for Jeremy Corbyn – “mugwump” – and then produce it like he’s James effing Joyce in every news interview for a 24-hour period. But he can’t expend quite so much care when discussing the evidential basis for the deployment of a nerve agent in an attempted assassination on UK soil.But on he goes. The Kremlin has duly picked up his slopfest and run with it – yet as Britain’s most shameless cynic, Boris hopes “the world will see through this shameless cynicism”. Oh dear. All we need now is Michael Gove to tell Britain to have some respect for the experts and we’ve got the full set.We are living through a political reboot of The\u0026nbspSorcerer’s Apprentice. Politicians who stoked distrust of expertise are now desperate for people to take the official word for things. The “ultra-patriotic” provisional wing of the leave campaign openly backs the Kremlin over the British government. And a whole lot of senior continuity remainers who are bemoaning it all have conveniently forgotten their own role in the intelligence misrepresentation that led up to Britain’s involvement in the Iraq war. It’s as if two generations of political chickens have come home to roost at once, and no one in charge knows what to do with them all. Rendang, perhaps. But are they even trusted to know how?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c00d1f20754d55014d61f17e628eccce7db268ec/1_0_3629_2178/master/3629.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f57e259c183bd67181c354ae3419b814 1240w","title":"phone camera microphone spying","story":"Taping over the lens is just the first step in keeping online snoopers out of your businessHere is what the former FBI director James Comey said when he was asked back in September 2016 if he covered his laptop’s webcam with tape.“Heck yeah, heck yeah.

Along the way he also asserted that the company used the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, to lobby for Amazon’s interests. The price of Amazon shares fell on the news.In threatening a single business because of some personal quarrel with its CEO – apparently in order to squeeze friendlier coverage out of a newspaper that the CEO happens to own – Donald Trump has clearly violated the basic rules of democratic government. But it is also important to remember that the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend. Amazon has been the subject of critical reporting for a number of years anyone who reads the Guardian or the New York Times knows about the company’s alarming labour practices and its imperial economic ambitions.Yet some critics of the president took his tweets as a signal to rally round Amazon and its chief executive. They joked about how jealous Trump must be of Bezos’s billions. They fantasised about how Bezos might contrive to humiliate the president by buying still more media properties. They clucked over Trump’s stupidity on the matter of the postal service. They snickered at his inability to understand modern internet enterprises.Given the chance to remind the public of American liberalism’s instinctive tendency to defend cyber-oligarchs like Bezos against the claims of those it sees as uncomprehending luddites, Team Liberal jumped at it.Along the way, they gave us a vivid reminder of why modern liberalism keeps generating – and losing to – unbelievably awful antagonists such as Trump. Put it this way: yes, Trump hates Amazon, and its chief executive, and his newspaper the Washington Post. But Trump’s blustering animosity doesn’t make Amazon an admirable company. Nor does it make the Washington Post a temple of objectivity, untainted by the capital’s culture of influence-peddling.Take the matter of the postal service’s contract with Amazon – the cause of so much self-assured guffawing among the know-better set. Guess what? The president’s complaint here is kind of legit. While it might be technically correct that the US postal service makes a “profit” on its current arrangement with Amazon, it would also be correct to say that it could easily be making a lot more.If you care about the postal service workforce, maybe you too might want to show some concern about the question rather than brush it off as yet more idiocy from the comb-over caudillo.Or take the larger question of Amazon’s overwhelming and unaccountable market power, which journalists and scholars have documented painstakingly and at great length – and yet which many commentators seem to have forgotten the instant Trump started bad-mouthing Bezos. “Amazon is the shining representative of a new golden age of monopoly,” is how the Atlantic journalist Franklin Foer put it in 2014, and what he said then is even truer today.Confronting concentrated, autocratic economic power is what Democrats used to do. It was the definition of the species. They fought against monopolies in oil and food and transport that ripped off producers with one hand and consumers with the other. But now it’s Trump who, in his clumsy and authoritarian way, is trying to swipe that legacy.I am making a tricky point here, so let me be clear: I don’t like Amazon, and I don’t like Donald Trump either. I would approve enthusiastically if a president started enforcing antitrust laws, but that’s not what Trump is proposing to do. What we are being offered instead is a choice between the worst president of our lifetimes and one of the most rapacious corporate enterprises in the country. And, eagerly, we are lining up with one or the other.This in turn seems to me an almost perfect representation of the wretched choices available to Americans these days, as well as the megadoses of self-deception we are swallowing in order to make them. It is everything that is wrong with our politics, and it extends from the most sweeping matters of state right down to the inidual reader.It set off my alarm bells when the would-be monopolist Bezos tangled with the book publisher Hachette in 2014, just after buying the most important news outlet in Washington – but after reading Trump’s bullying tweets on Amazon, I want to like the plucky plutocrat from Seattle.Similarly, I despise what this president is doing to the US – but after watching CNN or reading the Washington Post’s op-ed page I sometimes want to like Trump too. That’s how their transparently unfair coverage affects me.And this is where we are now in the world’s greatest democracy. We have the billionaire Republicans, with their bigotry and their war on all things public, and the billionaire Democrats, with their oblivious ideology of globe and technology.

In Brisbane a cheeky radio interviewer asks Prince Charles if he really does carry a personal lavatory seat on his travels, and the prince replies, “Oh, don’t believe all that crap.” Elsewhere in the Queensland capital, India win gold in the women’s weightlifting and lose to Cameroon in the men’s basketball. At Buckingham Palace, a menu is drawn up for a banquet to be attended later this month by 53 heads of state or their representatives. In Whitehall, the Department for International Trade ponders the effects on British farming of hormone-treated beef imports from Australia, which is a probable consequence of the UK’s first post-Brexit trade deal.In one way or another, the Commonwealth is responsible for all these things: for the Commonwealth Games, which demand the presence of the heir to the throne in Australia for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm), the 25th such conclave since 1971, which occurs in London (and Windsor Castle) on 16-20 April and, simply by its dogged and unlikely persistence as an international grouping, for permitting the British delusion that old imperial patterns of trade can replace the present arrangements with the EU. (Enter the hormone-treated beef.)Not that the Commonwealth itself encouraged this idea: nearly every Commonwealth republic and “realm” wanted the UK to remain inside the EU. And not that Europhobes have always prized the Commonwealth. As our present foreign secretary wrote in 2002, “It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies.” The Commonwealth that some Brexit campaigners had in mind was perhaps a little whiter – taking the definition of Commonwealth all the way back to the time when it meant the British empire’s settler dominions: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Newfoundland and South Africa, which were sovereign states, not colonies, and bound only by their loyalty to the crown.Indian independence forced Britain to be more flexible about who could be included. As India would be a republic, loyal oaths were out of the question. But Britain was keen to maintain some form of the old connection “in the mistaken belief”, according to the Commonwealth historian Philip Murphy, “that India’s huge standing army would continue to underwrite British great-power status”. There were other reasons too. Historic sentiment, fear of American ambition, the need to protect British markets: together they led Britain to propose a compromise. All that would be required was that India recognise the king as the head of the Commonwealth, “as the symbol of the free association of its independent member states”, rather than pledging loyalty to him. Even so, the offer still flew in the face of the complete withdrawal that had been promised by leaders of the independence movement. But India’s prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, finally went along with it – realising, he said, that Commonwealth membership meant “independence plus, not independence minus”.Other countries felt the same. In his forthcoming book, The Empire’s New Clothes: the Myth of the Commonwealth, Murphy argues that Britain didn’t mastermind the growth of the modern Commonwealth as part of a grand geopolitical strategy. Newly independent colonies wanted to belong, not least because their anticolonial leaders still felt a strong sense of cultural attachment to Britain and the British institutions – universities mainly – that had brought them into contact with contemporaries from other parts of the world.Any thought that the Commonwealth could successfully perpetuate the empire vanished with the Suez humiliation in 1956, when Nehru and India sided with Gamal Abdel Nasser and Egypt over the Anglo-French assault. The ties to London began to weaken. Names changed to reflect different realities. Founded in 1930, the British Empire Games became the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954, the British Commonwealth Games in 1970, and finally the Commonwealth Games in 1978.The theme of this month’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting is “Towards a Common Future”.

The medieval stone wall sits on extensive grassy ramparts that, in spring, are covered in a stunning display of daffodils – effectively becoming a two-mile-long flower bed. The bedrock of York’s abundant green spaces is the “strays”, 800 acres (324 hectares) of medieval common land that radiate out from the city, some of which still harbour herds of cattle and the occasional horse.Many of the smaller green spaces around the city were originally part of these strays too: the cemetery is actually the north-west corner of Walmgate Stray, while Scarcroft Green is a sliver of Micklegate Stray, from which also comes Knavesmire, the site of the York Tyburn gallows where the highwayman Dick Turpin met his doom. It’s best to explore the area by bicycle if possible (rentable at the station), but the inner parks are easily reached on foot – and well worth a visit. Here are a few of the best.Heading east across the river from the railway station, you immediately encounter York Museum Gardens, a small area that harbours some unique gems. On the right, soon after entering, there is a section of Roman wall, probably erected around the time of Emperor Septimus Severus, who died here in AD 211. Connected to it is the nine-metre-tall (30ft) Multangular Tower, also Roman. Further into the elegant gardens you’ll find the ruins of a Benedictine monastery, St Mary’s Abbey, which was built by the Normans and demolished by the Tudors. There’s also the medieval Hospitium, a popular wedding venue, plus the Yorkshire Museum.A short stroll brings you to Dean’s Park Gardens, the best spot for admiring York Minster, the largest gothic cathedral in Britain (open daily from 9am until dusk). Look out for what must be the finest park bench in England: an octagonal seat adorned with gargoyles, dragons and heraldry. It’s actually not old – put there in 2000 – but fits in perfectly with all the medieval magnificence around you. The chapterhouse, opposite the bench, is a 13th-century gem. Further into the park there’s the cathedral library (open 9am-4pm). Gray’s Court restaurant-hotel and garden is worth seeking out around the back of the park, or accessible from the city wall.York cemeteryOpened in 1837, York cemetery is a hidden delight, the final home to 124,000 residents, including four men who survived the Charge of the Light Brigade, 52 lord mayors, and John Severs, a man whose 1893 epitaph reads: “A quiet life he lived, he left no stain, free from enthusiasm, yet free from blame.” Wander up the avenues and paths, enjoying copious quantities of weeping stone angels and many other pithy elegies, not all ancient. “York will remember Columba,” reads one from 2000, “sculptress, printmaker, musician, singer, linguist, teacher, booklover, cook, dancer, friend.” The 10 hectares (24 acres) are also now a nature reserve with owls, bank voles, amphibians, 20 species of butterfly, and many unusual plants, including apple trees of old varieties such as ribston pippin and dog’s snout. On Fridays, the genealogy office can help with locating particular graves, and on summer Sundays there are guided walks.No name is more linked with York than Rowntree – the Quaker family who made a fortune from chocolate then ploughed a lot back into projects such as the ornamental Rowntree Park on the south bank of the river Ouse. There are tennis courts, a playground, a skate park and table tennis tables, plus the Reading cafe (in the former park keeper’s cottage) that makes a good stop for a coffee before exploring downriver. On the east side of the river the path takes you through Fulford Ings, where Harald Hardrada defeated an English army on 20 September 1066, forcing King Harold II north to defeat the Vikings, then march back to Hastings for an eye-watering appointment with destiny. Walking down the west bank takes you to Bishopthorpe where the archbishop of York has his residence you can then curl back across the Knavesmire racecourse.Homesteads ParkHead north upriver on the east bank of the river Ouse and you are on National cycle route 65. Homesteads Park is just behind the youth hostel (a good budget option for overnight). It’s a quiet 5.7-hectare (14-acre) plot, perfect for picnics and entertaining smaller kids – there’s a very good playground. If on bikes, you could continue up the river, following the route north across Rawcliffe Meadows nature reserve, then onward until you reach the National Trust’s Beningbrough Hall, a lovely eight-mile ride all on quiet roads and bridlepaths.

Now, with average temperatures rising, experts believe it could prosper here once again.Two studies in northern France, which has a similar climate to southern England, have found that it would be easy to provide for the black-veined white’s needs by creating flowery field margins and allowing the growth of young scrub such as hawthorn and blackthorn.Fabrizia Ratto, from the University of Southampton, who conducted one of the studies for the charity Butterfly Conservation, said: “Our study found that the butterfly has a strong preference for small isolated bushes of blackthorn and hawthorn as egg-laying sites with abundant nectar sources such as red clover nearby.“These habitat conditions can be recreated relatively easily in the UK through the implementation of agri-environmental measures such as nectar flower mixes in crop margins and by allowing some scrub regeneration beside adjacent hedgerows.”The results of the studies are revealed at Butterfly Conservation’s international symposium in Southampton this weekend.It is believed that Churchill became fascinated by the spectacular butterflies he encountered while serving as an officer in India. Unfortunately for him, his ambitious attempts to bring back the black-veined white were partly scuppered by his gardener, who accidentally hacked the nests of the young caterpillars from the hawthorn bushes where they had carefully been placed and burned them.Churchill had no better luck with his attempts to bring the swallowtail back to Kent. Despite enlisting the services of the leading butterfly breeder of the day, L Hugh Newman, he could not persuade it to breed in the wild, and was again not helped by gardeners who burned the fennel which the caterpillars fed upon.Churchill might have had more success today. While the British subspecies of the swallowtail is confined to the Broads of Norfolk and Suffolk, in recent summers climate warming has encouraged the continental subspecies of the swallowtail to cross the Channel, and several inidual butterflies have bred successfully on carrot and fennel plants in gardens and allotments in Sussex.Maverick attempts such as Churchill’s to reintroduce rare or extinct butterflies are frowned upon by conservation groups because they risk disrupting the scientific monitoring of species or introducing pathogens, but there is an increasing number of officially approved schemes to bring back scarce species. This summer the chequered skipper, which became extinct in England in 1977, is being returned to the forest of Rockingham in Northamptonshire via specimens from Belgium.Of the possibility of bringing back the black-veined white, Prof Tom Brereton of Butterfly Conservation, who supervised the research, said: “We have so few butterflies in the UK, the return of one of Europe’s most spectacular species would be a major boost for everyone who loves butterflies. Creating habitat conditions for this butterfly would benefit pollinating insects and other valuable species, many of which are threatened by the impacts of climate change.”While average temperatures look good for the black-veined white, experts say more research may be needed to determine whether the butterfly could survive the increasing frequency of extreme weather events that is a feature of our changing climate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68c203162791c5a172bff7adf5736e1b8a689df1/0_366_2957_1774/master/2957.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de045eb9052cd093c50948c5d0f7424b 5500w","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Whales, howler monkeys and signs of spring are among the pick of wildlife images from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a442cbdb3e56189199d7d37ca939dfa4967a4d/0_199_1719_1031/master/1719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b24e2f3285063fdae64d847d72ee0253 1240w","title":"wes anderson london isle dogs exhibition the store","story":"Exhibition of original sets and figures from Wes Anderson’s film has been extended due to demandCritics have hailed its “breathtaking visuals” and “meticulous construction”, now the chance to see the original sets and figures from the Isle of Dogs movie has brought more than 3,000 people a day flocking to an exhibition in London.The free exhibition, showing 17 sets from the film that was made in east London studios, has attracted more than 40,000 people since it opened on 23 March, with up to 400 people queuing round the block at any time.The show is being hosted by The Store Studios, who put it together with the film’s distributor, Fox Searchlight Pictures. It was due to close last Thursday but has been extended until Sunday, when it is expected the number through the door will have reached 50,000.Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs uses stop-motion animation to tell the story a 12-year-old boy, Atari Kobayashi, and his search for his beloved dog Spots, which has been exiled along with all the other dogs from Megasaki City to Trash Island by the evil mayor, who is also Atari’s guardian.Tommy Tannock, of The Store, said: “When I initially spoke to Wes’s team, they were excited by the idea of being able to give the film’s beautiful sets a second life as standalone artworks and function as a standalone experience to enrich filmgoers experience. “From each little miniature Japanese newspaper to the delicate swirls on the dogs’ fur, it’s been such a joy providing a platform to share the meticulous detail the set designers and puppeteers went to in order to deliver Wes Anderson’s vision of Japan.”The film was made with a team of 670 people, 240 sets and 1,097 puppets creating the 144,000 still frames.Among the 17 sets on display are the Taiko drummers who open the film, Professor Watanabe’s Laboratory, Megasaki City, several Trash island scenes and Spots’ landing.The Areal noodle bar, modelled on the one in the film frequented by Bill Murray’s character, Boss, and under the helm of a leading Japanese chef, Akira Shimizu, has sold nearly 3,000 bowls of ramen noodles, averaging 250 a day. “The chefs are exhausted,” Tannock said.“Having previously lived in Tokyo and being a Japanese food-obsessive, it was an absolute dream to work with Akira Shimizu’s team and set up a fully-functioning ramen bar that was a replica of the one in the film.”The Isle of Dogs exhibition is at The Store – located at 180 The Strand, London, WC2R 1EA – until Sunday from 11am to 7pm, last entry at 6.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76c44b571de3c8305832245cb4b405c3559e410/0_83_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=813d121ac8872886113dc4c20d29d473 1240w","title":"russell crowes divorce auction whats under the hammer","story":"The star is selling some of his treasured possessions. Here are five(ish) lots with a bit of historyYou know a man by the company he keeps, according to Aesop. But you can also get to know a man by his orce auction catalogue.On Saturday, Russell Crowe is celebrating his birthday and his wedding anniversary (Crowe and Danielle Spencer split in 2012 after being married for about nine years).. And he’s auctioning off what he calls “stuff” – hundreds of items including film costumes and props, modern Australian art (he has an excellent eye), sporting memorabilia (cricket and rugby league feature strongly), women’s jewellery (well, it is a orce auction) and guitars.Crowe’s auction at Sotheby’s in Sydney has the official title The Art of Divorce and has a picture of the actor on its catalogue. But what lies inside those pages? Which of the 227 lots are must-haves for your mantelpiece?Browsing through the catalogue is a strange experience. Watches and cricket caps, motorcycles and diamond rings. There is also one of the most impressive collections of 20th century Australian art, including paintings by Charles Blackman and Sidney Nolan.But looking at the movie memorabilia one gets hurled down a Rusty rabbit hole. Yes, all these things are just stuff, but they trigger memories – beautiful memories – of Crowe at all his ages and stages.Melbourne looked so grim in the 1992 classic – like parts of London with graffiti and tower blocks and angry dogs. Even the sex scenes were confusing, dirty and violent. A pissed-off looking Crowe in white overalls and his skinhead friends lived in smashed-up warehouses – which now probably cost millions of dollars. But his boots won’t – they are estimated to fetch $10,000-$15,000 (£5,500-£8,200). They are neo-Nazi skinhead boots that stomped on heads. How can you resist?Forget Gladiator, Crowe was at his physical peak in in this 1994 film. Youthful, sweet, face like a golden scone with bright blue currants for eyes. But why did he keep the cloth angel doll from the set? Was it significant?Gladiator codpiece, chariot, armour, plus prop horses that look both frightened and frightening. Many critics say Gladiator was Crowe at the height of his powers. But for me, Crowe’s standout performance was in LA Confidential. Crowe was all subdued menace and complicated tenderness playing Bud, the cop caught up in a love triangle with Kim Basinger and Guy Pearce. This was Crowe’s true breakthrough role, yet the only LA Confidential memorabilia is Lot 6. In the auction catalogue photo it looks like a selection of pamphlets and is described cryptically as ephemera.It’s 2005 and Rusty was in the big league, riding high on a run of good choices and juicy roles.But just at this high point he did something really weird. He threw a telephone at a hotel clerk in New York because he was frustrated he could not get through to his wife in Australia.A media circus ensued and when released, the New York Times reported: “Mr Crowe, wearing stubble, aviator sunglasses and a jacket bearing the name of his new film, Cinderella Man, was hustled into a police SUV, which raced away with a patrol car and two police scooters in tow, their lights and sirens running.”Could this be that jacket?These are the lots relating to 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, a band which never received the critical acclaim that Crowe craved. Back then Sydney-based journalist Jack Marx wrote of Rusty’s music: “It’s fair to say Russell’s music was a surprise. Where I had expected a lumpen, tuneless racket, what I heard instead was something far less remarkable – the colourless strums of a subway busker glazed with the deodorised slick of Christian rock. The most charitable thing I could feel about it was that it wasn’t complete crap.”But at least we have the guitars. Or you have the guitars. Bids start at $300 for a Truetone L21 Tobacco Sunburst acoustic guitar, inscribed by Les Paul, circa 1960s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39faa1d5844023b184172234f00c93ee21a8e943/368_19_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a2e5341e3f450524aa4e425bd88eb5e 1240w","title":"cardiff wolves championship match report","story":"By the end of the evening it was hard to make sense of an extraordinary game in which Cardiff City missed two injury-time penalties, Rúben Neves scored an exquisite free-kick and Neil Warnock told Nuno Espírito Santo to “fuck off” as the Wolves manager made a belated attempt to shake his counterpart’s hand after celebrating wildly with his players at the final whistle.That remarkable row, which continued long afterwards as Warnock branded Nuno a “disgrace” and accused the former Porto manager of a “lack of class”, overshadowed not only a fascinating match between the Championship’s top two teams but also the significance of this result.Wolves, who have been enjoying the view from the top of the Championship since October, are now nine points ahead of Cardiff and within touching distance of a return to the Premier League. They need a maximum of five points from their remaining five fixtures and could be promoted as early as Tuesday, depending on results elsewhere.Cardiff, in contrast, still have a bit to do and the big question is how much the manner of this defeat – their first in the league since New Year’s Day – will take out of Warnock’s players. After all, Cardiff were thrown a lifeline on two occasions here, first when Mike Dean penalised Conor Coady for a push on Anthony Pilkington in the 93rd minute, only for John Ruddy to superbly save Gary Madine’s penalty.The Cardiff fans were still coming to terms with that missed opportunity when Dean awarded another spot-kick, two minutes later, after Ivan Cavaleiro brought down Aron Gunnarsson. This time Junior Hoilett stepped forward, yet the winger also missed, hitting the crossbar with what proved to be the last kick of the game and prompting Nuno to run on to the field to join his euphoric team rather than acknowledge Warnock.The Cardiff manager was in no mood to accept Nuno’s attempts to shake hands on the pitch a little while later – he was captured on camera swearing repeatedly in the Portuguese’s direction – and also made it clear in his post-match press conference that he was not interested in having any sort of conversation in his office.“I don’t give a toss what he says. I won’t accept his apology,” Warnock said. “He’s totally out of order. In British football, you shake the manager’s hand afterwards. I just thought it showed a lack of class if I’m honest. So he can please himself. I went to shake his hand and he ran off – that’s what he did. If that’s how they’re taught in Portugal, fair enough. But not in Britain.”Told that Nuno had said in an interview that he wanted to personally apologise, Warnock replied: “Why would I speak to him? I don’t want to. He can say anything after the game. I’m talking about when the whistle goes, what he should do, the etiquette, the manners, the class. They’ve won the game, for God’s sake. He should shake your hand and say ‘unlucky’. You don’t have to run off like that and rub your nose in it. A disgrace.”Nuno insisted that he regretted his actions. “I am sorry. I hope Neil understands, I tried to tell him, but it’s very difficult to control your emotions when you get two penalties in the final minutes, the only person I had in my mind was John Ruddy, to give him a big hug because today he gave us the victory. But nobody can ever say that I am not a respectful person.”In other news, Neves curled a wonderful 25-yard free-kick into the top corner midway through the second half."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42128a87454983be6c37fcaf07861a97ec4ff326/0_59_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=95c70cbf41ac58e518cf338131394b87 1240w","title":"england women wales women world cup qualifier match report","story":"With Wales topping 2019 World Cup qualifying Group 1 and England a point behind having played a game fewer, this match offered Phil Neville’s side a strong competitive test for his first home outing, against a team with strong qualification ambitions of their own. The Lionesses’ 4-0, 6-0 and 5-0 demolitions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia and Kazakhstan respectively, and runner-up spot at the SheBelieves Cup, may have filled them with confidence but this draw will have measured that and left them ruing not making more of such a possession-heavy display.England began on the front foot, dominating possession, and spent much of the first half camped in the Wales half but it was Jayne Ludlow’s side who will have gone in at half-time feeling hard done by.With Wales defending deep, often dropping to five at the back, England were held to long-range efforts and set pieces, unable to break through such a well-rehearsed back line. The deep defending left Kayleigh Green (converted from a defender to a forward by Ludlow) isolated up front but Wales were not without chances of their own and they should have taken the lead in the eighth minute from a rare Wales corner delivered by Angharad James. The ball rolled teasingly through the box, taking a number of deflections and falling at the feet of Natasha Harding whose shot crossed the line before being booted clear. But the referee waved away Welsh appeals for the goal.At the other end England pushed and pushed at the Welsh back line but were crowded out in the centre. Toni Duggan, forced to go long, had a shot pushed on to the post by Laura O’Sullivan and the overworked keeper held the Lionesses at bay again as she tipped a Jordan Nobbs 30-yard screamer on to the bar.With the approach to the stadium filled with families, in particular young girls, and only two corners of St Mary’s kept empty while the rest of the stadium was filled with a crowd ofmore than 25,000 , the atmosphere was electric. Neville’s confidence of a Wembley outing in the next year looked increasingly likely as the Lionesses’ showed they can fill a Premier League ground.England started the second half much like the first but Duggan, Nikita Parris, Fran Kirby and Jodie Taylor were unable to keep the ball down in the box and string any passes between them. However, the introduction of Ellen White for Taylor and Melissa Lawley for Parris injected pace. Manchester City’s Lawley caused all kinds of trouble for Rhiannon Roberts with pacy runs and swift crosses from the left. Birmingham’s White stuck herself between the centre-backs Hayley Ladd and Loren Dykes, pulling them away from the dangerous Lawley.Seattle Reign’s Jess Fishlock looked to be Wales’s most threatening outlet on the counter, first racing from her own area but unable to find Green with her desperate through-ball. Later another Nobbs corner slid to the edge of the box and was picked off by Fishlock who broke free, with Harding at her side, only for Keira Walsh to make a brilliant tackle as the last player.With nine minutes left Neville amused the crowd and angered the fourth official when he stepped on to the pitch to help Green after she had gone down with cramp in front of him.In the closing stages England continued to seek a winner, Nobbs again testing the superb O’Sullivan, who tipped the ball into the path of Walsh, but she could only steer her shot into the side netting. Kirby’s strike in the 90th minute from the edge of the area brought O’Sullivan to full stretch.At the full-time whistle the Wales players and staff leapt into the air as if celebrating a win and danced in the centre circle while the England players walked the perimeter to applaud the fans. But having had their backs to the wall for the majority of the 90 minutes Wales deserved to soak up the single point gained from their defensive labour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbdbb0a02ec6312f963a100bfb465c59b94f160/0_146_4211_2526/master/4211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6e0d263cc49b87b61a842abe870921b4 1240w","title":"kevin de bruyne manchester city jose mourinho chelsea","story":"Kevin De Bruyne is as cool about being rejected by José Mourinho as he is when dismantling opponents with his laser-like midfield passes for Manchester City. It is the morning after the night before following City’s 3-0 trouncing by Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final first leg. Despite the disappointment, De Bruyne, dressed in a white No\u0026nbsp17 City training top, is in eloquent form.The Belgian is content to recall being sold to Wolfsburg in January 2014 when Mourinho was in charge at Chelsea and how this helped make him pivotal in a City team who are a glaring 16 points ahead of Manchester United. In Saturday’s Manchester derby Mourinho knows if De Bruyne can be stymied United will go a long way to preventing Pep Guardiola’s side from sealing the title against their fiercest rivals in front of their own crowd.De Bruyne bounced back from being discarded by Mourinho to become one of the game’s top footballers and is a firm contender for the player of the year award. In his sole full season in the Bundesliga he was the 2014-15 footballer of the year, winning him a move to City for a then club-record £55m.Asked about his experience under Mourinho, De Bruyne strikes a calm note. “I really don’t care,” the 26-year-old says. “It’s just part of football – it goes up and down. In the 10 years I’ve been playing, nine and a half years have been up and a half year has been a bit down.“I can be really happy with the way it’s gone because a lot of people go up and down, up and down. I’ve had the feeling that gradually I’ve got better and better. That was an experience where I learned maybe the most out of how football goes, how I go with the situation. I was only 21 at the time – no one is going to play all the time at that age. If I see the amount of games I’ve played in my career it’s a lot, so I’m happy.”De Bruyne’s principal challenger for the player of the year awards is Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The Egyptian is another player in whom Mourinho showed scant faith, allowing him to go out on loan to Fiorentina and Roma after signing the forward for Chelsea in January 2014.“Everyone needs to find a system and playing style that suits. Probably now we’ve found somebody who suits us both more than it was before. In both our cases that’s true but that’s the same for a lot of players. It’s just because it’s the same manager and it’s both of us in the same season who are going well that people are talking about it. But every manager will have had a lot of players who were not suited with each other, who went away and did well. I’m not really that type of person who thinks about that. It’s just the way it goes, in life, in football.”December’s reverse fixture ended in a 2-1 win for City at Old Trafford. Afterwards Mourinho was involved in a bust-up with Guardiola’s players after he went to the dressing room to ask that their music be turned down and more respect shown.De Bruyne is defiant when asked if there may be a repeat. “The volume is always up,” he says. “It’s our way to prepare for games, the music is on before the game and after, so it’s not like because we won we’re going to change, it’s just because it’s the thing we do, it’s the thing that gets us relaxed, maybe.“Some teams don’t do music but a lot of teams I’ve played in have. Obviously the dressing rooms are mostly close to each other but it’s not to mock anybody.”City are closing in on a slew of records. Beat United and they will be champions with a record-breaking six matches to spare They would jump to 87 points and have a chance of eclipsing the 95 of Mourinho’s 2004-05 title winners.De Bruyne is unsure what strength of side Guardiola will field. “I can understand the feeling of supporters,” he says. “But I don’t know what the coach wants to do. We have four games in 10 days or something so it’s his decision. I know how it goes between fans on social media, how it goes after games. That’s their thing, naturally. All the players are desperate to play every game. You perform for 10 months on a good level to try to get to these sort of games, and hopefully you can finish it off well.”Those four matches comprise Liverpool away and home in the Champions League, United’s visit and then next Saturday’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur. De Bruyne displays confidence, as he has to, that City will be unaffected by the Liverpool defeat despite a first half in which they were torn apart.“The last time we lost a game we showed a reaction which is a good thing,” he says of the 3-0 EFL Cup final win over Arsenal that followed a 1-0 defeat at Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup. “I’m not saying we’re going to win the game it’s going to be tough. We just played and Saturday is early but we will try everything to win that game and then we will see.”De Bruyne’s vision on the pitch can be sublime. In October’s 7-2 thrashing of Stoke a delightful reverse pass to Leroy Sané nullified seven defenders before the German picked out Raheem Sterling for the home side’s second goal.De Bruyne offers a modest take on the whole thing. “You can’t train for that kind of ball,” he says. “Because it’s almost never going to happen, that that situation is going to be there, that the defence is going to be open and in that line.”He is more upbeat over the prospect of City retaining the title, an achievement managed only by United and Chelsea in the Premier League era. “To maintain it is always more difficult than to win it the first time,” he says, “but I have the feeling this time we can go on.”He finishes with an intriguing insight into Guardiola’s style. “If you speak one to one, he can be very close to you,” De Bruyne says. “But I guess, when you’re a coach, you need to have a bit of space between you and the player. He’s your boss and so you have to do what he asks you to do, and if you’re too close it can lead to problems with players, if they see that. So it’s a fine balance for a manager but the way he does it for this team is good.”Against United, City hope to restore the equilibrium that was shattered at Anfield on Wednesday. As ever, De Bruyne will be key."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205cc236fe88f198d4887e20509ec24aab77d036/0_533_2675_1605/master/2675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0a88bd9861dc6e565531faac2620193c 1240w","title":"sonali shah my teachers helped me at every stage","story":"TV presenter Sonali Shah’s education put her on track to be a doctor.

I left school with 11 A*As at GCSE and three As at A-level, so I’d say it served me very well! “I put a lot of that success down to my teachers. I was lucky enough to have a teacher at every stage of my schooling who pushed me, and that gave me confidence. The best teachers I had at school knew their subject inside out, and that knowledge is the key to being able to explain it to a child in a way they can understand.

Not only did he have a passion for his subject, but he could explain it in a way that made us enthusiastic about it too. I didn’t have much confidence in maths, then my teacher said he expected me to get an A*, so I put in the extra effort because I didn’t want to let him down. “I moved to Haydon school for my sixth form years because it had a good reputation for science. I chose to study biology, chemistry and psychology, but I found chemistry quite hard at first. Then a new teacher arrived and changed everything. He recognised I needed some extra one-on-one time, and helped me during lunch to fill the gaps in my knowledge. Suddenly, everything clicked into place. I don’t think I would have got an A grade without him. “I’ve just chaired an event at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, celebrating the amazing achievements of women in Stem. Women in history have achieved so much in these sectors, but sometimes their achievements aren’t as well known as those of men who have made similar breakthroughs. We need more girls to pursue Stem subjects at school, so the range of breakthroughs coming from women will increase – and we need great teachers to make this happen.“I was planning a career in medicine – I wanted to be a paediatrician – but just before applying for a university place, my mother suggested I should perhaps try ‘something different’. She pointed out that her generation had to train in jobs that were stable, but I had more freedom to take risks. At the time I was a volunteer at Mount Vernon hospital’s radio station, playing requests for patients on the cancer wards. As it turns out, chatting on the radio felt very natural so I applied to study broadcast journalism at the Centre for Broadcasting and Journalism at Nottingham Trent University instead. “I still sometimes think about what a career in medicine might have looked like. I am grateful that my education gave me choices in life – I was very fortunate to have teachers who believed in me and what I could achieve. My goal is to one day be able to combine my passions and present a science or medical programme.”For information about a career in teaching, visit Get Into Teaching "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74dbdd057645bbbca744ef179900c1b48bdd6228/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3f181e9c434e8e3671726c88ac25b581 2600w","title":"ikoyi london sw1 restaurant review","story":"With West African-inspired flavours and British ingredients under a roof of minimalist fine dining, Ikoyi may not be authentic, but it’s puzzlingly innovativeRestaurant criticism, a little like black pudding, does not benefit from close scrutiny as to its beginnings. How I choose which restaurants to sprinkle my own brand of fairy dust on is the question I’m asked most, but the answer rarely pleases. It’s complex, fickle, flighty.Ikoyi, for example, named after an affluent district of Lagos, has pirouetted around my “should go” list for at least six months, tumbling downwards into the “distracted by shinier, newer things” pile, before rallying upwards again via another food scenester’s tip. People who love food, or rather the food scene, have certainly taken to Ikoyi.But in my heart, I suppose, I knew before setting a slingback in this pricey, West African-influenced, hyper-modern fine-dining restaurant that it would be a complex affair to sell. Because Ikoyi is not a “West African restaurant” with which one could confidently chivvy people with links to Burkina Faso or Guinea-Bissau and say, “I’ve got just the place for you.”There’s a chance they might spy, say, the two delicate pieces of plantain festooned with vividly cerise dehydrated raspberry powder on a plate for £5.50 and ask, churlishly, “What fresh hell is this?” Furthermore, if West African cuisine is a blind spot to you, and your first dalliance with northern Nigerian cooking is Ikoyi’s version of dambu nama (a fuzzy, addictive dried beef floss), you might end up more confused than before. Neither of my worries are criticisms, merely pointers. Ikoyi would feel peculiar, challenging and unique whether you were from Nigeria or Nantwich.That dambu nama, for example, is made from longhorn beef and comes atop a delicate tartlet of whipped bone marrow pancake not much bigger than a 50p piece. Ikoyi is Lagos via the Ledbury. Chef Jeremy Chan and his business partner Ire Hassan-Odukele employ West African ingredients – scotch bonnet, grains of selim, ndolé leaves – to bring new life to very British things such as Exmoor caviar, Orkney scallops and wild Scottish turbot. They serve this mashup of tribute, innovation and cultural trickiness in a pale, minimal, modern room while playing Warren G’s Regulate and Blue Lights by Jorja Smith. The staff deliver it all brightly and politely.Only the hardest heart couldn’t warm to all this. Although, of course, that hard heart might then go on to quibble about the authenticity of the jollof rice’s stock, which contains shiitake mushrooms, katsuobushi and kombu, and that it is a crab jollof featuring apple, sorrel chives and coriander. But perhaps that’s part of the fun, because, like most important dishes, people have been quibbling over jollof – the regional ownership, the ingredients – twice daily since the Kingdom of Jollof’s emergence circa 1549.Ikoyi’s stand-out dish for me, at £14, was a perfect, albeit small, rich disc of malted barley dough, not dissimilar to a souped-up slice of Soreen, topped with mushroom suya – or, to describe it more accurately, a pine-infused pile of earthy morel, miso and yaji ragú with an emulsion of pine and kumquat. The turbot (which is painfully fashionable right now – in fact, merely saying “turbot” makes you more relevant) comes on the bone with a squid-ink sauce, okra, steamed onions and sea beets. A plate of barely grilled duck arrived on an uda-infused, smoked candied bacon sauce strewn with sour camomile onions and cassava. We drank a bottle of the house red – Tinto Prunus 2015 – and puzzled our way through each delivery. The Kent mango, ogbono and buttermilk pudding is a slice of perfect parfait shaped like a credit card. It’s one of the nicest things I’ve put in my mouth this year.Ikoyi, six months after opening, is one of the most damning things a restaurant can be: not always delicious, certainly dear, but clearly important. If West-African cuisine is close to your heart, your boundaries will be tested beautifully. If, on the other hand, you’ve missed the past 3,000 years, there’s no better place to jump in than here.• Ikoyi 1 St James’s Market, London SW1, 020-3583 4660.

It’s the figure of a nun with hands joined, eyes closed and an ecstatic expression. The cartouche on the right says it’s “Our Lady Of Soledad”, a 17th century work by an unknown artist.Ever since adolescence, I’ve liked the term “unknown”. It means that all I can know of the person who made this painting is the work I have before my eyes. I find it a great opportunity. I can devote myself to the pure result of a creative gesture, without worrying about a big or small name. Before me is simply the composition of a human being who summoned his inventive energy and, rejecting countless other possible ways of using his time, fought with the raw material of colours to place on this surface – from within a tradition he had behind him, and with all the ability he was capable of, forgetting even himself – his personal figure of a woman praying.The more I look at the nun, the better I know the unknown artist of the 17th century. Not through biographical facts, not through his life story, but through his expressive strategies. In them I find inscribed in full another story – his story as an artist, which is a story of aesthetic choices, of compositional intelligence, of the grammar and syntax of an image, of feelings given shape. In the work of art, biography and autobiography have a truth completely different from that which we attribute to a CV or an income tax return. In that space there is, there has to be, a freedom of invention that allows one to violate all the agreements about truth in everyday life. To be clear: the artist of Our Lady Of Soledad is unknown to me only on the historical-biographical level. He is very well known to me, on the other hand, in the exercise of his function as an author – so well known that I could give to that function, for convenience, a name, for example, a female name.It would not be a pseudonym, that is, a false name it would be the only true name used to identify her imaginative power, her ability. Every other label would be problematic, would bring into the work precisely that which has been kept out of it, so that it would stay afloat in the great river of forms. Naturally the game could also be extended to artists whom, wrongly, we don’t consider “Unknown”. If I had to give to the creative act of Seven Acts Of Mercy the name Caravaggio, and to the biographically determined person, the name Michelangelo Merisi, I would choose to spend the greater part of my time with Caravaggio, and not with Merisi. Merisi would blur my vision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3c16ca5093c486b265acb050cb35f825a3ee15/0_73_2500_2499/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2ae72a4878b1049f47522135c6c6a08f 1240w","title":"fit in my 40s british military fitness","story":"We did so many sit-ups that my abs went into a catatonic state and I finished using only two dusty vertebrae in my lower back You’ll know British Military Fitness by its trail of shouting hordes of the red-faced righteous chasing across parks after a tiny, hectoring man in camo. The instructors are probably not that small, they’re just farther away. It is, according to legend, a fantastically fast and effective way to get fit – some combination of the fresh air, the uncompromising style and the comradeship in adversity. It’s exercise as theatre, for people who love exercise and maybe don’t realise how much they love theatre: you engage in the group delusion that you’re actually in the army, and that makes you work harder.There’s lots of running – slow running at the start, a mile run in the middle, sideways running for warm-up purposes, sprinting at the end, jogging back to the finish. I thought I knew what kind of runner I was, until I did it with other people, when I realised I was rather easy on myself. I was second to last on every turn, until a split second before the end, when the super-competitive woman behind me would come beetling up and trounce me. I was a great motivator for her, put it that way.My instructor wasn’t a shouter he was more like one of those teachers who knows you can do better, and you know you can’t, and you don’t want to disappoint him because he seems so nice, but also, what on earth is he on about?But the bit you’ll notice from afar, the bit that will have put you off if you are at all physically shy – which is to say normal – is the bit where you work in pairs. There is a tacit agreement that women work with women and men with men. When you’re an uneven number, the beta female has to work with the beta male, which is how I found myself doing press-ups into a stranger’s fist. He was lying face down with his fist up and my aim was to dip and touch it with my sternum I wasn’t up to it and would just brush him with whatever body part landed first, inevitably some breast or other. He’d say motivational things, such as, “Don’t forget to breathe”, while I battled agony and embarrassment, and averted my eyes. It reminded me of something… it reminded me of being in labour. Two minutes felt like an hour.We did so many sit-ups that my abs went into a catatonic state and I finished using only two dusty vertebrae in my lower back. A long-forgotten song by the 90s indie band Salad started to pound my head, like the beginning of a traumatised state.We swapped partners now I had a woman, except a tiny one, about the size of my 10-year-old son, and I had to put my full weight on her thighs and tricep dip.

Now she is campaigning to help prevent others suffering as she hasLike many parents, Claire Throssell carries her sons’ sports gear in the back of her car. Paul’s running trainers and Jack’s PE kit sit in the boot – but they have been there for a long time. For three and a half years, in fact: ever since the two boys were murdered by their father.“It took just 15 minutes for my life to end and my existence to begin,” she says as she recalls the events of 22 October 2014.On that day, Darren Sykes, to whom she was married for 16 years, committed the most atrocious of crimes. In a pre-planned act, he lured Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, up to the attic of the family home with the promise of a new train set.“That in itself makes me feel sick,” Claire says, rubbing the ring on her wedding finger, created from her son’s combined ashes. “My lovely boys thought, for once, their dad was showing them affection and trying to make an effort.”But Sykes, along with Jack and Paul, only came out of the house in the arms of firefighters – who themselves were left severely traumatised by the scene they faced.Sykes had used five canisters of petrol, bought two days earlier, to turn the three-bedroom house into a blazing inferno. Although, it emerged later, Jack fought to save his younger brother, neither boy stood a chance. “What haunts me the most is that, as their mum, I wasn’t there for my sons when they needed me the most,” says Claire, 45, who works as a teaching assistant in Penistone, South Yorkshire.She was first wooed by Sykes, a carpet fitter, in 1995. “He sent me a single red rose every day for a fortnight until I finally agreed to go on a date. I was too young and naive to realise this was indicative of an obsessive and controlling personality that would dominate me for years.”The couple married a year later, and although they were happy enough initially, Claire can pinpoint the exact moment her husband changed.“While I felt absolute joy at becoming pregnant, he became moody and needy, because I wasn’t giving him the attention he wanted,” she says. “He saw his son as competition.“Any affection for me disappeared he would put me down, insult me for being overweight and tell me no man would find me attractive. He was physically abusive, and sexually I was no more than a means to an end for him.”After Paul was born, Claire focused on being a mum. “That was the fundamental difference. I loved our children more than life itself. He saw them as possessions. There were many times he would scream at Paul because he wanted him to finish the soggy remains of his breakfast cereal. I would stand between them, letting him yell at me, rather than take out his anger on our little boy.”Claire did try to walk away, taking the boys to live with her mum for days at a time. “But stupidly, I always fell for his apologies and told myself it was better for the boys that they didn’t come from a broken home.”But the final straw came when Sykes mocked his wife for her weight in front of her sons and ordered her to stand on the bathroom scales. “It hit me that if I didn’t take my sons away from this, they may come to think this was normal behaviour and begin to replicate it,” she says. “I couldn’t bear the thought of their innocent personalities being dirtied by that monster. Already Jack had stood between me and his dad to defend me and bear the brunt of his anger.”Claire took her children and moved in with her mum, Pamela, in nearby Thurlstone. She began orce proceedings and a bitter custody battle through the family courts commenced.“Initially, I encouraged the boys to spend time with their dad – again, something that now eats away at me – but after months of hearings, they said they didn’t want to see him.”Their visits were reduced to twice a week, one evening after school for two hours and on Sunday afternoon. Claire says, “I gave them a phone so if they needed me while they were with their dad they could contact me.”But that Wednesday, Claire got back from work to discover the boys had gone with Sykes without their mobile. “Instantly, my heart raced,” she says. The final custody hearing was two weeks away and Sykes was furious his sons had stated they wanted their visits reduced, if not stopped.“I was worried he would be nasty to them or threaten them if they didn’t change their minds. I could barely eat. I was counting down the minutes until Jack and Paul would be home.”But her boys never did come running through the door. Instead, a police officer rushed Claire to Sheffield Children’s Hospital, where her youngest son, Paul, died in her arms from smoke inhalation.“I’d brought Paul into the world, but could never have envisaged I would have to see him leave, too,” she says. “My little boy who could sprint around a running track with the wind in his sails couldn’t escape what his own father had done to him.“I wanted to hold him for ever, keep him close to me but – horrendously – he was classed as police evidence, and I was ordered to stop touching him.”Claire was then taken to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where Jack clung to life for five days. Sykes had been declared dead an hour after Paul.“I sat by Jack’s bedside reading him his favourite David Walliams books, willing him to make it, praying I wouldn’t lose both my children.”“In that moment, I wanted to be dead, too, so I could be with my boys.” But it was Jack himself who inadvertently helped his mum carry on. “He had fought so hard to live,” Claire says. “I still had a choice to live. My children didn’t.” Jack’s final words to the firefighters who pulled him out of the house were: “My dad did this and he did it deliberately.”“I couldn’t allow their deaths to be in vain. I had to stop another mum suffering like I had, stop another child dying needlessly at the hands of a controlling father.”The months that followed, though, tested Claire’s strength. Not only had she lost her sons, but her house was destroyed and Sykes had written to the bank stating he was no longer responsible for the mortgage, and had not renewed the home insurance. It was only the incredible generosity of the local community that meant the house could be rebuilt and sold.On those long, harrowing days, when Claire wasn’t sitting wrapped in her son’s “snuggle” blankets, she would go to their graves. “When it rained, I literally clawed at the soil, wanting to pull their ashes out. They hated the dark, and they hated wet weather – the thought of them being underground still tears me apart.”The simplest things would leave her heartbroken. “I froze to the spot in the shampoo aisle in Tesco when I saw the brand the boys used. When I could move again, I dropped my basket and left, still able to smell their wet hair as they cuddled in to me for a bedtime story.”She can’t bring herself to speak of their death, preferring to refer to the time they began sleeping.Claire questioned how a father could do this to his children. She says, “In most domestic childhood murder cases, the father is the perpetrator. The attackers see the children as something they created and therefore have a right to take away.”She has become an ambassador for Women’s Aid and campaigns to have the process in the family courts changed. A forthcoming domestic abuse bill is likely to prevent abusers being allowed to cross-examine their victims. The next stage is to petition for judges to be held accountable for decisions they make in relation to a custody hearing. “If I can prevent one other mum going through the pain I’ve suffered, stop them having to question whether they could have prevented their child’s death, hopefully my sons didn’t die in vain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2632d8803ce0b44372c39d12b56c5b9291676fa/104_304_979_587/master/979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9d023b414677039cffdb15c17ab99916 1240w","title":"quiz this machine kills fascists guitar maths mull thomas eaton","story":"From maths to Mull, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Which duchess, as a girl, had dolls called Mrs Astor and Mrs Vanderbilt?2 The Sundarbans is a forest on what bay?3 “This machine kills fascists” was written on whose guitar?4 What movement’s name means Discipline of the Dharma Wheel in Chinese?5 Bowser, or King Koopa, is whose archenemy?6 Which two letters don’t appear in the official names of chemical elements?7 Maryam Mirzakhani was the first woman to win which maths prize?8 Which visiting bird is great grey or red-backed?What links:9 Andorra Monaco San Marino Vatican City (monetarily)?10 Vestibule and cochlea Skye and Mull Hohhot in China barristers’ association?11 Woking Brackley Milton Keynes Grove Kannapolis Maranello?12 Norris Hytner Nunn Eyre Hall Olivier?13 Contubernium centuria cohors legio?14 American Gothic The Child’s Bath Nighthawks A Sunday On La Grande Jatte?15 Dysnomia Charon, Nix, Hydra, Styx, Kerberos Hi’iaka, Namaka?1 The Duchess of Windsor. 2 Bay of Bengal. 3 Woody Guthrie.4 Falun Gong. 5 Mario (Super Mario games). 6 J and Q. 7 Fields medal. 8 Shrike. 9 Non-EU states issuing euro coins. 10 Inner: parts of inner ear in Inner Hebrides capital of Inner Mongolia Inner Temple. 11 Bases of Formula One teams: McLaren Mercedes Red Bull Williams Haas Ferrari. 12 National Theatre artistic directors. 13 Units of the Roman army. 14 Works in the Art Institute of Chicago: Grant Wood Mary Cassatt Edward Hopper Georges Seurat. 15 Moons of dwarf planets: Eris Pluto Haumea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e591a8fb6e397c94c65d4c69f7c6b1c95231afab/0_12_5189_3114/master/5189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=90b074e170e10521eb9fe3b31b456afe 1240w","title":"the joys of spring leaving office with sun still up making travel plans","story":"Leaving the office with the sun still up sets a fire in my belly.

Here in New York, winter was very much present on the official first day\u0026nbspof spring – a nor’easter that swept in to dump just over a\u0026nbspfoot of snow before swanning out dramatically. Even knowing climate change is real was no consolation: as\u0026nbspI crunched through the snow, face wrapped in a scarf and head down against the wind, it felt spiteful.But now, mere days later, the sunshine feels a little less weedy.

Faraway states – is it time to visit Colorado, or perhaps New Mexico? – suddenly feel as if they’re closer, and all I want to do is pack a bag and go. The reality is expensive, but thankfully dreams are\u0026nbspstill free.At home, I have hung up art to welcome the new season, and bought new bedsheets. I thought of\u0026nbspPersephone as I repotted a plant (we honour the old gods as well as the new, after all), and studiously read up on my Christmas cactus – now, apparently, is the time for fertiliser. I whacked some rugs. As\u0026nbspthe dust settled, I stuck my head out of the window. The cold air burned my lungs.

Embarrassingly, I had to call him because I couldn’t figure out how to change the bulb, but he says it’s not my fault.“These bulbs don’t come out,” he says. “The whole fitting has to\u0026nbspbe replaced.”“That’s ridiculous,” I say, feeling vindicated.“When you’re done, I’ve got a garden light that needs installing,” my wife says.I like watching other people work. I could easily spend a whole afternoon looking through a peephole in the hoarding surrounding a construction site. To\u0026nbspme, the appeal is obvious: all the satisfaction and accomplishment of work, without the\u0026nbspwork.It is, however, a little unattractive. I spent most of August standing at my bedroom window watching four men paint a school, ducking out of sight whenever one of them turned around. For two days in November, I sat in the kitchen looking on while my garden office was constructed. Two months later, I sat in my new office watching a man called Tomasz lay a brick patio.“It is a good day to work!” he said to me each morning as I crossed the garden.“Yes, it is,” I said.My office is a glass-fronted observation booth. I can watch my wife mop the kitchen floor from my desk. But it means that when I’m observing, I am also observable.On Thursday, a load of plants arrive. Our friend Anna, who is a garden designer and knows about these things, has come to show us where to stick them. The middle one, just home from university, is being paid to help out. I see them as I cross the garden in the morning, coffee in hand, on my way to my computer.“Are we going to be disturbing you, digging and planting while you’re trying to work?” Anna asks.“Nope,” I say.“Disturbing him?” my wife says.“I’ll be fine,” I say. “I’m used to it.”“If you think you’re going to sit in that box all day watching us do everything,” my\u0026nbspwife says.“Actually, I have business in town,” I say.“What business?” she says.“Business business,” I say.“He’s got a lot going on, your husband,” Anna says.“He doesn’t,” my wife says. “He’s lying.”My business – technically more of an errand – takes about an hour. When I get back, all the plants are still in their pots, although they have been set in their positions along the empty beds. “Looks good,” I say. “I’ll get out of your way.”“What are you talking about?” my wife says. “You’re helping.”I am assigned the northern end of the left bed. My first strike with the spade hits something hard, causing my fillings to vibrate like tuning forks. I fish up the broken corner of a concrete paving slab, followed by the rest of the paving slab, followed by the paving slab next to it. My shoulder blades burn. Sweat runs off the end of my nose. It’s tough work, I think, but honest.“Why are you making those noises?” my\u0026nbspwife says.“What noises?” I say.“The grunting and wincing,” she says.“I hit a slab,” I say.“No one else is making noises,” she says. “Anna’s not sighing and groaning.”“It’s all construction rubble at this end,” I say.“Your son isn’t muttering and swearing under his breath,” she says.“He’s planting peonies,” I say. “I’m excavating a Roman villa.”“You are making a lot of noise,” the middle one says.“Stop listening to me work,” I say.“We can’t,” my wife says.A week later, I’m in my office when I\u0026nbspcatch sight of my wife crossing the grass with Kitch the electrician, here to\u0026nbspinstall the outdoor light. She pulls open the door, and I stand. “Coffee, two sugars,” Kitch says. “Your missus can’t work the machine.”“Just finishing some business,” I say.“We could see you,” my wife says. “You were sitting there reading a book.”“That’s not true,” I say. And it isn’t. I was sitting there holding a book, fast asleep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6d3f2d0233cd45dc70e23cc5fb6be7cde25965/50_101_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3e97008faf08fcdeee0add3f272ce390 1240w","title":"guido fawkes a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine","story":"The site Boris Johnson called the dung on the rosebush of politics was the first to report on Corbyn’s seder dinner with JewdasWhen Guido Fawkes, the online scandal sheet, celebrated its 10th anniversary at a swanky cocktail party and dinner in Westminster four years ago, the prime minister sent a video message apologising for being unable to attend, and half the cabinet were on the guest list.The website has an unapologetically two-faced approach to the establishment it claims to disdain. It is comfortably embedded in its fleshpots while shovelling steaming piles of ordure on its members.This week, Guido was first to report on Jeremy Corbyn’s seder dinner with the left-wing Jewish group Jewdas. The site’s detractors accuse it of misrepresenting left-wing Jewish groups in the row over antisemitism, but as Boris Johnson, then London mayor, put it at that 10th anniversary party, Guido has long been the dung on the rosebush of politics.Once, in the early days back in 2004 when the website, a kind of knock-off of the pioneering Popbitch gossip site, had barely 100 hits a week, the identity of Guido was a closely guarded secret. But Paul Staines, now in his early 50s, has become familiar in TV studios and last year he claimed nearly a million hits a week on the various Guido sites. Staines, a former Hong Kong trader, is now editor-in-chief of an outfit with a seven-section website covering tech and media as well as politics. One of Guido’s writers is a member of the Westminster lobby, the very organisation he once castigated as the epitome of backscratching journalistic corruption.He swaggers along what ought to be the tricky line between feeding off politicians and biting them, often with a drink in hand. Five years ago he told the Guardian: “I still hate politicians. My contempt for them is undiminished.” The politicians know this, but they appear to nervous of crossing him. “We cringe and simper around Guido,” Johnson said at the anniversary celebration, “in the pathetic delusion that we may thereby encourage him to be merciful to us.” Guido does not hate all politicians equally. He is a committed Brexiter: remainers get a particular beating on the Euro Guido pages, where their referendum predictions are vigilantly policed (the same treatment is not applied to Brexit promises). And though Staines insists anything stupid or hypocritical is fair game, he appears to find politicians on the left disproportionately worthy of his opprobrium.But then it is no secret that his politics are right wing, free market, Thatcherite. At university in Hull in the 1980s he was a member of the Federation of Conservative Students, an organisation so right-wing that it was disbanded by Mrs Thatcher. “I never wore a ‘Hang Mandela’ badge, but I hung out with people who did …” he once said. Later he worked for close Thatcher fixers like David Hart, and he reminisces about Africa and AK-47s like a character from late LeCarre.His breakthrough was to see early on just how the alcohol-fuelled gossip and backbiting of Westminster that makes and breaks inidual careers could be translated to, and magnified by, the digital blogosphere. He recognised how the world of the political gang, of in and out, of foolishness and deceit and political manipulation and retribution could have been purposely designed to provide rolling content for the voracious appetite of a news website.What he created was a cross between a comic and a propaganda machine. Its common denominator is to belittle politicians, and anyone else (currently the Observer’s Carole Cadwalladr for her award-winning expose on Cambridge Analytica) with whom he disagrees.The website is no stranger to the law courts, and Staines has boasted that he likes a good vendetta. But from time to time the procession of gossip, recycled tweets and leaks from the special advisers and bag carriers who provide the daily bread and butter for the site is interrupted with a serious story. Staines claims the scalp of the former Lib Dem MP for Portsmouth, Michael Hancock, who stood down after it emerged that he had had an inappropriate relationship with a constituent. It demolished the career of Damian McBride, who it discovered was planning to smear senior Tories, and had a leading part in the destruction of Chris Huhne, another LibDem MP, over the drink-driving charge that ultimately forced his resignation and ended his marriage. The website sets stories running. It rarely does the hard slog of hunting them down. For example, it heard well sourced reports about bullying by MPs of staff, but it appears never to have tried to build up the kind of case that could prevent injustices being perpetuated. Instead it chucks a rock of innuendo into the pool and moves on, always hungry for a new way of entertaining its readers, while confirming their prejudices. Staines might one day be a footnote in the history of democracy, but his purpose has never been to promote its long-term health.

Now, outside of the public sector, that security has all but vanished. “Here’s the £106,000 you saved. Cheerio and good luck to you” is, basically, what you’re going to hear. £106,000, by the way, is the average amount 55- to 65-year-olds currently have saved in a workplace “defined contribution” pension, according to pension company Aegon.Will you get much advice? Probably not – many professional advisers will turn their noses up at such small sums (to them). And finding a decent adviser is a lottery in itself.You will also need to learn an ugly new word – “decumulation” – and take some big guesses about your health and longevity. The single biggest problem with managing your money in retirement is that you don’t know when you’ll die, or whether or not you will need expensive long-term care.The potential for rip-offs is enormous. That’s why the pension minister, Guy Opperman, must take on board recommendations this week from the work and pensions select committee and create a low-cost deal at retirement which is as automatic as the current enrolment system.The weirdness of our market-based pension system is that Nest, the government-owned body that delivers auto-enrolment for many small employers, is forbidden from offering drawdown or other decumulation plans. Why? Because they will probably do it cheaper than the profit-seeking private companies.This nonsense has to end. Nest must provide a low-cost benchmark service for managing your money through retirement – and in effect force the private companies to fall in line.But none of this is going to lessen the challenge of saving enough first. The grim reality is that while £106,000 sounds like a lot of money, it is peanuts when it comes to pensions. It will give you an income of less than £5,000 a year in retirement – and leaves you wide open to the vagaries of inflation and any stock market collapses. If you want an income of £25,000 a year in retirement – consisting of £8,300-a-year state pension as well as a £16,700-a-year private pension – that many say is the benchmark for a decent life, you will have to save north of £300,000.But don’t get too depressed – if you are a couple, both 40, with no savings so far, but can stretch to putting aside £40 per week each into a pension scheme, then it’s (just) possible to hit the £25,000 a year target income that many experts say is what you need in retirement. Good luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8011c277449c449a6dd2771472126fb013bdec/0_403_6048_3629/master/6048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9f40f2bcd031987459c130945bf6c689 1240w","title":"the aa fees prices introductory offer","story":"Is the AA exploiting its most loyal customers – the elderly but also the very busy – by automatically renewing annual breakdown cover at up to twice the original price, in the expectation many won’t notice?That’s the allegation from two AA staff members who have contacted Guardian Money keen to expose the “shameful and embarrassing” way they claim the breakdown recovery business now operates.The contracts they sign mean their policy is automatically renewed every year, which the salespeople described as a “scandal” as they say it leads to people overpaying for policies that they no longer want or, in many cases, will never claim on, as they may have sold their car.The AA is by no means alone in offering teaser first-year discounts. But the salespeople who contacted Guardian Money say it’s the scale and the manner of the second-year increase that sets the company apart.The AA, with 3.3 million breakdown members, vigorously rejects these claims, adding that it has made “great progress in the last couple of years to be much clearer and transparent in pricing and selling”.Our whistleblowers say they have spoken out in part because they are fed up with being verbally attacked by customers on the receiving end of steep price rises.Each year, four out of five AA customers decide to renew. But the complicated pricing tariff used by the salespeople, and seen by Money, shows by how much fees are hiked in the second year.Its popular joint membership, that covers roadside assistance and home start, is £109 for “new” customers. But at the end of the first year, that rises to £215 with the money taken out under a continuous payment authority. The AA says it does this so customers aren’t left without cover.“Everyone thinks that the AA is there to help but, from what we’ve seen, it’s about one thing – sucking people in on a super-cheap price before moving them on to a higher rate. There’s a guy who sold his car two years ago who ended up paying the AA for two years’ cover because they’d moved house and not told the AA. When he realised, it was too late to get his money back,” says one of the AA staff, who have asked to remain anonymous.The second says it is the AA’s Gold members that he feels most sorry for. “I went to the dentist and, as I had my AA uniform on, he proudly told me he was an AA Gold member. Out of interest, I asked what he was paying. When I told him what a new customer on the exact same package would pay – half of what he was paying – he was furious. As I left, he was getting on the phone to give them hell, but he wouldn’t have got a refund of any previous years’ overpayments.”• People from eastern Europe, who have poor English, are often promised European cover is included when it is not. They only find this out when they break down, and have their claim declined.• Iniduals are sold a more expensive “any car” policy even though they only ever use one.• Customers complaining have to wait until their policy has lapsed for 90 days before they can rejoin via the field sales team at the discounted price.• AA Gold members (those who have been members for five years or more) are often paying twice as much as a customer who has just joined from the RAC. The AA’s data shows its customers typically stay with the firm for 12 years.AA president Edmund King says: “We are very clear about putting our members at the heart of what we do and delivering excellent service. Treating customers fairly is built into all of our policies and processes, and into the training of all our people whatever their role in the AA.“We have worked hard to promote our great products in a fair and transparent way. We do offer discounted introductory offers (via a sales force, online call centres and in advertising).He says the AA writes to all customers before renewal, at which point they have a choice whether to renew or not. “Any customer can benefit from introductory offers via the call centre or with the direct sales force so there is no ‘discrimination’ if one doesn’t have access to the internet. Our letters are very clear and go far beyond much that is seen in the commercial world. We are proud to comply with the FCA’s requirements on renewal transparency.”In regard to customers moving home and not seeing renewal letters, King says: “We have strengthened all of our procedures for following up on returned mail when people have moved. We use a range of methods to re-establish contact.”What you tell us“I called the AA to cancel and was immediately offered a refund of £123, taking us back to the previous price. I was told ‘We did not overcharge you – we charged you the full price and now we are giving you a discount’.“I called the AA to cancel and was immediately offered a refund of £123, taking us back to the previous price.

Stroll through the clothes racks and towards the checkout, past the mini cacti, glittery photo frames and avocado bed linen, and you’ll find a selection of books. “READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO BE INSTAGRAM FAMOUS,” screams one in all-caps, while next to it whispers another called The Little Book of Self-Care. It’s emblematic of an identity crisis that is engulfing a whole generation – the so-called fame-hungry narcissists v hyper-aware over-thinkers – and one that’s increasingly being reflected by its pop stars. Recently, it gained its anthem in the shape of We Are Fucked by 18-year-old Noah Cyrus (featuring Mø), a surprisingly self-lacerating, Max Martin-produced nihilistic banger that simmers with frustration at Cyrus’s generation’s social media addiction and her fears for how it might hobble their future.For Cyrus, her personal social media addiction is Instagram, which she first started using when she was 12. “I wake up and the first thing I check is Instagram and I don’t think that’s a healthy state of mind,” she says. “Youth culture is wrapped up in social media. Instagram tells us you need to look a certain way to be famous. Everybody’s obsessed and I think it’s endangering young people and what we think youth culture has to be.”So why is it Cyrus’s generation specifically (Generation Z is roughly marked as those born anywhere between the mid-1990s and mid-00s) who are starting to sing about it, and why with such anger? How does it fit alongside previous acts of musical nihilism that grew out of the punk scene in the 70s, grunge in the 90s and hip-hop’s recent downbeat turn? Recent Universal Music signing, the Swedish singer-songwriter LOVA, AKA 19-year-old Lova Alvilde, actively eschews writing about some of pop’s typical themes (love, heartbreak, being “in da club”). Her forthcoming EP will focus instead on the false idea of perfection generated by social media, with forthcoming single Insecurities being the first taste. “For me, writing about social media and its effect on people has always felt like a very natural and important thing to do,” she says. “I think it’s going to be hard not to write about it, especially for younger, upcoming artists. Social media is such a current factor, not only in my life but for almost every person of my generation, so that makes it a more obvious thing to write about. I want to open up to conversations about how society is shaping us into not talking about the things that actually matter.”Alvilde’s frustrations with social media’s addictive cycle of false affirmation also chime with We Are Fucked (the chorus of which runs “We are fucked These days we only follow These days we’re feeling hollow”). “We have basically been told to believe and trust that the ‘perfect’ life that social media is portraying is the one we should all strive for,” she says. “That then makes it harder for us to break free from it and see how far from reality it actually is.”While skewed-pop duo Let’s Eat Grandma, AKA teenagers Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth, set their 2016 debut album I, Gemini in otherworldly landscapes, recent single Hot Pink came with a video that played on that falsity referred to by Alvilde. Their new album I’m All Ears comes peppered with references to mobile phones. “I really enjoy TV shows and music and media generally where they reference the fact that people spend time on their phones,” says Hollingworth. “It seems odd to me in films where they don’t use their phones once, when it’s set in 2018. That’s not what people’s lives are like now we connect with each other through the internet whether you like it or not. We’ve always been interested in playing with the idea of people’s perceptions being altered by the media and phones and the internet.”For Generation Z, the whole approach to social media in the first place is different to how the baby boomers or Generations X and Y approached it in the past. Ruban Nielson, frontman of psych-pop experimentalists Unknown Mortal Orchestra, whose new album Sex \u0026amp Food investigates what we as a society consume and how it affects us, thinks this is a key point as to why it’s becoming more of pressing concern. “When you talk to someone who is a baby boomer or Generation X about all this they would say: ‘This is the real me, and this is the version of me on social media,’” he says. “But the thing that is really monstrous about it is that for younger people who have it as a more formative part of their identity, you might end up with no real ‘me’ behind the social media. All the emphasis will be put on social media to actually represent the full scope of who you are and there might not be a identity behind that. That’s more terrifying. I have two children and I protect them as much as possible from that stuff but there’s no way to socialise your children without acknowledging that these things are out there.”While Dr Aaron Balick, author of The Psychodynamics of Social Networking, agrees that “for Generation Z, social media is more embedded into the social fabric than previous generations”, he also sees this as not wholly negative. “On the one hand, the social self as represented online is in some ways a fundamental, but young people are savvy too, and are capable of engaging with it critically.”Balick sees We Are Fucked’s attack on ruptured identities as more of a wake-up call than a shrug: “This song represents that criticism, drawing attention to the fact that a postured presentation of self could be a direct road to being fucked.” Even within the song, Cyrus offers an olive branch when she sings: “We’ve got hearts in the right places But we’re still a danger to ourselves Maybe it’s cuz we are young”.“We are good people,” she tells the Guide. “I would like to consider myself an amazing person but I’m still an addict. Not just Instagram, but all social media. We’re wasting time.”It’s this sense of acting on frustration, of wanting to change, that not only distinguishes Gen Z from the more stereotypically spoiled millennials, but sets Cyrus’s We Are Fucked apart from more typical teenage nihilism.Songwriter Savan Kotecha, who co-wrote We Are Fucked alongside Cyrus and Swedish pop alchemist Max Martin, agrees. “The youth are so articulate and bright and aware. We’re going to see more of that, I think they can sense when something’s wrong, even if they don’t have all the answers.” Kotecha says that, from other sessions he has been in, more and more artists of Cyrus’s age are starting to write not only about the identity crises social media inflicts, but wider issues affecting their generation.“I’ve noticed that in the last six or seven months: more artists wanting to discuss things they wouldn’t a year ago,” he says. “For American artists, there’s a sense of responsibility. Pop should be fun and escapist, of course, but it’s the artists who feel they can be heard who want to put some of that in the music.” He lists the likes of Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Lorde and Cyrus as examples. “It’s hard for a pop artist who’s known for doing fun songs to get super political, but they’re figuring it out.”We Are Fucked should be taken in a wider context of the next generation of pop stars becoming more aware of, and critiquing, their surroundings. It is also part of a conversation about the positives and negatives of social media that’s as blurred and seemingly contradictory as Urban Outfitters’ books selection, and more complex than Jack White is willing to understand.“I truly believe that the older generation have more to learn from us than we have to learn from them,” says Alvilde. “Today’s society is constantly changing and evolving and I think they have a harder time keeping up with that.”Balick agrees: “The speed at which social technologies change makes it a bit more difficult for older generations to understand the nature of the challenges of the younger ones because the generation gaps get smaller and smaller.”Pop, as it always has done, reflects society, and at the moment there’s a generational shift towards a youth culture raised in a prism of self-evaluation and self-recognition. “I wouldn’t say we’re lazy or don’t have potential, we’re just not channelling it correctly all the time,” states Cyrus. “We can do more than just social media. We can change the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4a07efc6214bcbd69f8d19b37316e2d2571e87/137_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=784e45bc9fa4e87160287f679feb49af 10500w","title":"way of grief and park life fridays best photos","story":"The Guardian’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world including Orthodox Christians marking Good Friday and reaction to a former South Korean president’s prison term"},{"url":null,"title":"the truth about gender pay gap video explainer","story":"Britain has carried out one of the biggest data-gathering exercises on the gender pay gap, exposing large disparities between the average pay given to men and women in some of the country\u0027s best-known companies.\u0026nbspWe dispel some of the myths around the gap, and explain what it really means and why it matters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e1c7fd92fc0cd16ff5ca497d29a19fa89941b4/0_208_4134_2482/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=33b0390dd55e58dcd445b1b434e992b6 1240w","title":"leaked minutes show labour at odds over antisemitism claims","story":"Exclusive: Corbyn supporters tried to block action against members facing complaintsThe depth of the split in the Labour party’s ruling body over antisemitism and racism has been laid bare in leaked minutes that show fierce disagreements over disciplinary action.Key supporters of Jeremy Corbyn attempted to block action against Labour members facing complaints, according to the minutes obtained by the Guardian.Momentum’s founder, Jon Lansman, and the MP Jon Trickett were two prominent figures who voted to limit disciplinary action in the three contentious cases that went to a vote, multiple sources said. Lansman has been outspoken in recent days on the need for Labour to take antisemitism cases in the party seriously.The minutes of the meeting in early March show how fractured the disciplinary body has become. Sources said cases involving Corbyn supporters were regularly automatically viewed as being politically motivated.Among the cases which allies of the Labour leader pushed to rule out the possibility of expulsion were:Almost all members of the national executive committee (NEC) elected on the leftwing slate acted as a block vote to try to minimise disciplinary action against several members at the committee’s disputes panel meeting in March, according to the minutes and sources at the meeting.Multiple sources have alleged that suspended members who were perceived as being sympathetic to Corbyn were defended, even when the evidence against them was overwhelming.“People were generally outraged at the scale of the defence of just anything. It’s all about control: control of the party and control of the processes,” one source close to the NEC said.Euan Phillips, who runs the campaign Labour Against Antisemitism, said he was losing faith in the management of complaints. “We have been reporting this anti-Jewish racism for months and months now assuming that the party and the ‘quasi-judicial’ disputes panel would take it seriously,” he said. “Anyone defending antisemitism should be off the NEC and out of the Labour party.”The panel in March was chaired by Christine Shawcroft, who was later forced to resign from the NEC after it emerged she had sent an email defending a Labour councillor accused of Holocaust denial.Among cases discussed included a member who is alleged to have blamed Zionists for causing his problems with the party after he was suspended over a confrontation with another member who had raised fears about antisemitism and Holocaust denial.Sources said Lansman and Darren Williams, one of the constituency party representatives, both argued the man’s case should not be referred for possible expulsion, but were overruled. The case did not go to a vote.Williams moved an amendment to defend another case where a woman is reported to have made antisemitic remarks on social media, as well as supporting George Galloway in Manchester Gorton against Labour.In both cases, trade union members and others on the NEC including MPs and councillors intervened and blocked attempts to just give the members a warning and training, instead referring them to Labour’s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee (NCC), which can recommend expulsion. In a Facebook post after the meeting, Williams expressed anger that so many party members were facing possible expulsion. “It’s deeply disappointing to see party members put on a path to likely expulsion when the evidence of their supposed wrongdoing is far from compelling,” he wrote.The minutes also reveal Shawcroft refused to recuse herself as chair when the panel heard the case of a Labour councillor who has been accused of using a racist term to describe a black council candidate and co-ordinating with the party of the disgraced Tower Hamlets former mayor Lutfur Rahman against Labour.Shawcroft, an active member in Tower Hamlets who was once herself suspended for defending Rahman, was asked to recuse herself after other NEC members said she had acted as a “silent friend” of the councillor during his investigatory interview, but refused, the minutes said.Seven members of the NEC then voted to limit further disciplinary action, with several arguing the case was based on factional ides, but again they were defeated by other members. The case will now be heard by the NCC.Tower Hamlets councillor Rachael Saunders welcomed the decision by the NEC to refer the councillor for disciplinary action. “It has taken us a while to sort out Tower Hamlets politics, it is a good thing that we are now able to move forward and that there are consequences,” she said.All members of the NEC, including the leader and deputy leader, can attend NEC disputes panel meetings but Corbyn and Tom Watson were not at the meeting. Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, was the only one of the three shadow cabinet representatives who were at the meeting, with Kate Osamor and Rebecca Long-Bailey absent.Sources close to the NEC said disputes panel meetings now regularly go on for three hours. The body reviews the most serious cases, referred to them by party staff who make a recommendation for further action.The majority of cases discussed at the March meeting saw disciplinary recommendations accepted without a vote, though some after heated debate.Williams declined to comment, while Shawcroft said that she could not discuss inidual cases but that members of the NEC were behaving in an appropriate manner. “Cases are presented for discussion, not for rubber-stamping,” she said. Saying that the discussions were in line with the recommendations of the report by Shami Chakrabarti into antisemitism, she added: “All complaints must be taken extremely seriously and looked at carefully. It’s therefore right that the panel fully consider each case and the different sanctions that can be applied. That’s what the meetings are for.”Lansman and Trickett did not respond to a request for comment.Richard Angell, director of Labour’s centrist pressure group Progress, said the votes at the meeting showed complaints were still treated as being politically motivated. “The new establishment may say one thing in public but in private they are using their political muscle to defend their friends and allies,” he said.“Training on antisemitism is for those who show remorse and want to change – like Naz Shah MP – not for those who double down and think they have done no wrong.”A Labour source said that the NEC panel was simply doing its job. “The role of the NEC disputes panel is to review and discuss cases to decide what disciplinary action should be taken, as happened in this meeting,” the source said. “Most decisions were unanimous, the few votes that took place were to decide what type of sanction should be applied, not whether action should be taken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d04c4cb7510a4bd9a8bec449f53425aeccee895/0_71_1731_1038/master/1731.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b51b0673e228ade28d936bf4081213 3000w","title":"how to give your kitten the purrfect start in life","story":"Eager to bring a ball of joy and fluff into your world? Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd2568f458da8dd713042a0fccc94663387448b/0_0_3000_2663/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cd5d9b5184e8c9ded6e98418ff7258cf 1240w","title":"charles darwin lost fossils including a sloth the size of a car to be made public","story":"Fossils collected by Darwin on his global voyages on the Beagle will be digitally scanned and made available onlineOn 23 September 1832 a young naturalist, thousands of miles from home and frequently seasick and homesick, found the fossil of an enormous skull embedded in soft rock. It took Charles Darwin three hours to chip it out of the cliff face at Punta Alta in Argentina, and hours more to lug it back to base. He arrived with it long after dark at the ship which became the most famous in the history of natural science, the Beagle.Darwin was only 24, a college dropout from his medical degree who had done a crash course in geology in order to join the voyage. He was wild with excitement about the chase, writing in a letter to a friend: “I have just got scent of some fossil bones of a Mammoth, what they may be I do not know, but if gold or galloping will get them, they shall be mine”.Darwin’s treasures, brought on board after every shore trip to the exasperation of the crew of the small cramped ship, and sent back to England whenever he came upon a vessel making the return journey, were all meticulously recorded in his journals, and labelled according to a four-colour system he devised himself using printed labels he had brought from England.His fossils, much less famous now in the history of how he came to publish his theory of evolution by natural selection than his observations of wildlife, are among the treasures of the Natural History Museum in London. They are still of interest to scientists all over the world but many of the originals are almost too fragile to handle. The NHM this week launches an ambitious project to scan and digitally recreate the fossils in 3D, in such minute detail that they can be studied by scientists as well as pored over by members of the public. One of the first completed has just been digitally dissected by a scientist in Montpellier in France.The digitisation also guarantees that a permanent record of the bones will be preserved as scientific tests continue. Carbon dating has recently confirmed a date for one which Darwin could only have guessed at from the rock layer in which he found it – just 12,660 years old, so very close to the extinction of its species – and the NHM will now attempt to extract DNA from it.The first to go online is the skull of Toxodon platensis, which Darwin found propped up against the fence in a Uruguayan farmer’s yard, where the local children competed to throw stones and knock out its teeth. Darwin bought it for a shilling and sixpence (equivalent to £6.40 today). Its curved teeth led Darwin and fellow scientists to wonder if it was an gigantic rodent, but it was eventually identified as a distant relative of a rhinoceros – and the last member of a group of South American mammals stretching back 60m years.As they arrived back in England, Darwin’s fossils were already becoming famous and making his reputation, when he still had years of the voyage ahead. One batch contained a missing section of a skeleton which had already been sent back by another collector – the creature whose skull Darwin had chipped out of the cliff face. They were the remains of Megatherium, a ground dwelling relative of modern tree dwelling sloths – but Megatherium was the size of a car, the largest and heaviest land mammal ever to live in South America. After the fossils were displayed at a science event in London, one friend wrote to Darwin: “From sending home the much desired bones of Megatherium your name is likely to be immortalised.” In fact, Megatherium and its relationship to modern animals was one of the observations which would set Darwin’s mind on the course which would make his name immortal, and the publication decades later of his great book.At the NHM, senior curator Pip Brewer and Adrian Lister, a research leader in the museum’s Earth Sciences department who has written a new book on Darwin’s fossils, share Darwin’s excitement over the hunt, having tracked down a chunk of fossil where it has been missing in plain sight for more than a century.They launched an international hunt for Darwin fossils as part of the project. Most came to their museum after the second world war from the Royal College of Surgeons – which in the 19th century had the best comparative anatomy collection, while Darwin was scathing about the British Museum’s displays of its natural history specimens. The huge skull remains with the RCS, and others went to Harvard in the 19th century with a Swiss scientist, a correspondent of Darwin’s. The missing slice of the skull which Darwin chipped out of the Argentinian cliff in 1832 turned up in his own home, Down House, now a museum run by English Heritage.“They told us they had a bit of tooth in the stores but they no idea what it was. When we got there they had had it laid out on a table and we recognised it as the missing piece of Megatherium in seconds,” Lister said. They later brought the fossil to the RCS, and could see instantly how perfectly the cut marks matched with the rest of the skull.“It wasn’t quite as dramatic as Darwin’s discovery of it – but it was still such a thrill,” Brewer added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4bb8137b48d84c2072eefbd7e5208541f23189/778_440_2542_1526/master/2542.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b107d566920037ec048e5e526c99904 5000w","title":"developing mobile technology manage funds farmers poverty myagro anushka ratnayake skoll social entrepreneurship awards","story":"Skoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship winner: Anushka Ratnayake, myAgroSkoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship winner: Anushka Ratnayake, myAgroStuck in a cycle of low income due to poor-quality seeds, many farmers in developing countries find it hard to improve output, but Anushka Ratnayke’s myAgro offers a secure and easy scratchcard system to help them save via a mobile phoneAnushka Ratnayake was in a remote part of Rwanda, working for a microcredit organisation, when she had a lightbulb moment.Local farmers had money at harvest time, but by planting time, when they needed to buy seed and fertiliser, their money had run out. “I kept hearing people saying: ‘can I overpay my loan’? They were using the language of credit but describing a savings programme. I thought: what if I created a model for farmers to save?” She came up with the idea for myAgro, a pioneering micro-savings project, which now operates in Mali and Senegal.“Every day, I went to the local kiosk to buy phone credit,” she says. “The store owner was a good businesswoman – she knew her customer base well, and the profit margin on everything.” But the upfront costs for the shop owner to buy items such as seeds and fertiliser were too high, and there was no space in the store to keep the quantities the farmers needed. “I thought: what if I could create a cost-effective model to enable farmers to save for seeds and fertilisers in a really convenient and easy way?”With myAgro’s Mobile Layaway platform, farmers save for seeds, fertiliser and specialised training via scratchcards – in the same way they might buy phone credit. The cards are bought at the local convenience store, and farmers then text the number on the card to their myAgro account. That way, they are confident their money is being saved securely. They are enrolled in the scheme at harvest time, when they have money, and myAgro helps them save and plan for the next season.When it comes to planting season, the seeds have already been paid for and are delivered to the farmers. They can also access training to ensure their harvest has a good chance of being more successful than it has been in previous years. In Mali, for instance, Ratnayake found that farmers often have a lot of land, but do not cultivate it because the soil needs fertiliser that they cannot afford. As a result, they are not able to feed their families.Ratnayake is excited about the opportunities that being a Skoll award winner will bring. “We are incredibly honoured and thrilled to be part of the Skoll community,” she says. “We can bring the myAgro story to a wider audience, network within the Skoll community itself, learn from them and maybe partner with some of those organisations in the future.”Through the product margin it makes on each item sold, myAgro expects to be sustainable by 2021. “Our goal is that by 2025 we will have reached a million smallholder farmers, doubling their income. That’s an increase of $550 per family per year,” she says.What are the Skoll Awards for Social Entrepreneurship?The Skoll Foundation was set up in 1999 with the aim of driving large-scale change through investing in, connecting and celebrating social entrepreneurs, with the awards taking place annually since 2005. The awards are about “shining a light on what is working in the world” according to president andchief executive Sally Osberg. “We wanted to invest in solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. The Skoll Awards are a way for us to do that,” she says. “We see entrepreneurs as agents of opportunity, of creative disruption.”Organisations are nominated by Skoll’s network of partners, for qualities such as impact potential, collaboration and innovation, and must be led by visionary social entrepreneurs. Each winner gets a $1.25m three-year core support investment to scale work and increase impact. This year, five of the six awards have been presented to women, something Osberg thinks is significant. “There is a perception that women entrepreneurs either don’t exist or don’t prevail,” she says. “We wanted to see if we could prove that wrong, and I believe we’ve done that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b58301fad1c6052f7f86b58442e4becef9fb25ab/0_105_3154_1893/master/3154.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7381707c54356fc82af5f24ba03325c9 1240w","title":"actions will speak louder than words on the gender pay gap","story":"Amelia Gentleman (Angry about the pay gap, 3 April) was helpful in separating out the various reasons for unequal pay, together with ideas for women to tackle the problem. But where is the advice to employers that unequal pay is often the result of unequal opportunities and where is the recognition that they, employers, also have a part to play in providing solutions?Many jobs advertised as full-time could be done by part-timers or as job shares. There are easy-to-find organisations out there with experience in advising about this. Where are the talent spotters, identifying women in their companies with the capacity to learn and do more, enabling them to move into the higher-paid male-dominated areas.And let’s not forget the responsibility of government. Years after these issues were first raised, we still have too few girls choosing Stem subjects, a well understood avenue to well-paid employment. Childcare? Often affordable for parents of one child, out of reach for more than one. Hence the exodus of women from decently paid full-time jobs with prospects into part-time work, almost always at the bottom of the pay and opportunities ladder. Exposure of the gender pay gap is of course helpful, but only actions and commitment to solutions will start\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspsolve\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproblem.Margaret ProsserLabour, House of Lords• The figures so far are fairly crude and open to a degree of interpretation (as some people will not be included in the calculations), but the pattern is clear. Most companies report a pay disparity in favour of men, and the construction and finance sectors seem to be the worst offenders. The real reason for the pay gap is not necessarily that women are getting paid less for the same work as men, but more likely that they are not getting into the higher-paid positions. And if companies want to reduce their gender pay gap, this is the area that would make a difference.It will be interesting to see what happens next. The reasons given by companies for their pay gap suggests a tendency to make excuses rather than accept that there is an imbalance which they could do anything about. The obligation to report is an annual one, so we will need to wait another year to see if progress is being made.Amy RichardsonAssociate solicitor, Coffin Mew, Brighton• Reading Boswell’s life of Dr Johnson, I came upon the following entry on 11 April 1773. “I put a question to him upon a fact in common life, which he could not answer, nor have I found any one else who could. What is the reason that women servants, though obliged to be at the expense of purchasing their own clothes, have much lower wages than men servants, to whom a great proportion of that article is furnished, and when in fact our female house servants work much harder than the male?”What answer would Boswell get\u0026nbsptoday?Jim BaillieSale, Cheshire That part-timers get lower pay per hour is thus the explanation for some half of that gender pay gap currently being reported, isn’t it? Across the entire economy, it will be higher in those fields and organisations which employ more than the average proportion of part-timers. This is such a well known fact that even those in their ivory towers should grasp it.Tim WorstallSenior fellow, Adam Smith InstituteThe government could take two easy steps now to improve matters for working women: first, make firms obey the minimum wage law or, better yet, ensure that all employees get paid a real living wage, giving them enough to live on without benefits. If companies were made to pay decent wages, the Tory austerity agenda could be shelved, and millions of lives would be improved it really is that simple.David ReedLondon• I was buying something and couldn’t decide between two purchases. I decided to look at each company’s gender pay gap and choose the one that paid women the fairest. If other women consult the pay gap before deciding where to spend their money, we could perhaps move this thing along a bit more speedily. Let’s start a “spend where it’s fair” movement.Janet GravesMellor, Cheshire• So after championing the just about managing, Theresa May has now adopted the gender pay gap as her cause du jour – what could possibly go wrong?R SchuhlePontefract, West Yorkshire• While not wishing to deny a gender pay gap, it should be noted that gender gap reporting is on gross income per hour, before the effect of tax and benefits. So, for instance, men pay about twice as much income tax as women (£60bn against £30bn), whereas, because some women earn less (and are more likely to head a single-parent family), some women will gain through the benefit system. For instance (based on an online calculator), a single parent working 20 hours a week at £10 an hour with one child under 16 will have their take home pay almost doubled (from £8,000 to £16,000). The effect of using gross pay instead of income net of tax and benefits therefore seriously overstates the headline gender pay gap figure. Michael McGuffieWellington, Somerset• Your editorial on the gender pay gap (5 April) claims that “exploitation ... is what this is about”, and implies that it reveals “a workplace that denigrates its female staff”. Both these statements go beyond the evidence and distort the real problem. As you rightly say, the survey raises “questions about the obstacles to advancement through male-dominated hierarchies”, as well as “the broader problem with pay ratios”. Of course management should aim to encourage and promote women wherever possible, and overall excessive pay differentials are a central problem for government. But it has been the case that many women prefer jobs aimed at looking after inidual people, rather than committing their energy to playing “the organisation game”.This tendency has been observable both in choosing careers and in accepting promotion into administrative posts – and even in the public sector, where the objective is, in some general sense, the public interest. This is only a marginal tendency, with huge numbers of exceptions, and it may well be gradually shifting as a result of cultural change among both women and men – but so long as it remains, some continuing gap will be neither “exploitative” nor “denigrating”. Such dogmatic language merely antagonises employers, who feel misunderstood and defensive.Alan BaileyLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.comletters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d22b5e58265e2030bf80bb96d54666278f9241ae/0_213_5562_3337/master/5562.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af1a4095ef8ee3f9d236c85ca3aeab3a 2600w","title":"blackpool struggles kick heroin seaside deprivation","story":"Locals blame poverty and budget cuts for its position as a national hotspot for deaths from the drug When Johnny first tried heroin in 1987 aged 15, he had been told the drug was a bit like cannabis. “If someone had said to me then, ‘See that bag of brown powder you’re picking up? Kiss goodbye to the next 30 years of your life’, I would have thought twice.”The 47-year-old has been off the drug for nine months and says he has never felt so well, but many of his friends have not been so lucky. Over the years he has been to the funerals of 19 people who have died from drug overdoses. “I hung around with 22 lads when I was growing up, and there are three of them left now,” he says.Johnny’s experience is not unique. His hometown, Blackpool, was one of seven coastal towns to feature in a list this week of 10 local authorities in England and Wales with the highest rates of heroin deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics.The Lancashire seaside resort tops that list and has recorded the highest rate of deaths involving heroin or morphine of any other council district since 2010. There were 14 heroin misuse deaths per 100,000 people in 2016, compared with the national average of 1.7 in England and 2.3 in Wales. That is almost twice as high as the borough with the next highest rate – Burnley, with 7.6 per 100,000.Arif Rajpura, Blackpool’s director of public health, says the high death rate was due to a number of factors, most of which were linked to poverty. The town has plenty of very cheap accommodation – often in former tourist guesthouses – which attracts hard-up people from surrounding areas. “Blackpool imports its ill health,” he says. “People are often running away from something. They’ve got a positive memory of Blackpool from visiting as a child and they see Blackpool as a place to go where they can find cheap housing.”The situation in the town, Rajpura says, is also part of a national picture in which heroin deaths have more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, from 579 to 1,201. He points to analysis by Public Health England that partly attributed the rising death rate to the increasingly frail “Trainspotting generation” – people who started using the drug in the late 80s and 90s and whose health has been ruined by decades of addiction.Gordon Marsden, the MP for Blackpool South, says the ability of local authorities such as Blackpool to deal with problems like drug abuse had been seriously hindered by cuts to council budgets. Blackpool council has lost £450m from its budget over the past seven years. “When you look at that in the context of a relatively small unitary authority – with a population of around 150,000 – that is a lot of money,” he says.Marsden is also keen to point out that the problems the town faces are shared with other coastal areas. Bournemouth, Portsmouth, Hastings, Thanet, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot also appear on the list of heroin death hotspots. “Seaside towns often have far more in common with each other, even if they’re 200 miles apart, than they have with towns that are 20 miles inland,” he says.It is a view shared by Will Jennings, a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Southampton and co-founder of the Centre for Towns, a thinktank that has highlighted the exodus of young people from smaller towns to find work in big cities. The demise of many British seaside towns cannot be viewed as part of the general trend of deindustrialisation that brought economic decline in some of their inland neighbours, he argues.“This is about a very long-term historical arc over 50 years,” says Jennings. “At a certain point in history, around 100 years ago, they were actually quite affluent leisure destinations.” The rise of foreign travel hit places like Blackpool, he says, and the fact that many seaside towns are poorly connected to big cities means young people have had to move away to find work.Ian Treasure, the service manager at the charity Blackpool Fulfilling Lives, insists the town is taking innovative steps to tackle its problems. “Every seaside town has this dichotomy of the glitzy promenade and then the problems behind the scenes, but the work that is going on in Blackpool is really making a difference.”The charity is one of scores of groups in the town working to help its most vulnerable residents. Established in 2014 in partnership with the national charity Addaction using £10m of lottery funding, it works with people who are struggling with mental health issues, drug addiction, and homelessness. Staff and volunteers, many of whom have had experience of drug addiction themselves, work with iniduals to navigate the system and access services – accompanying them to appointments and helping them fill out forms. “Blackpool is serious about trying to reverse the tide on the negative publicity we’ve had because look around today, it’s wonderful,” Treasure says. “It’s sunny, it’s warm, there are people shopping. It’s a lovely place to be.” He thinks everybody in the town should feel a sense of responsibility to help address its drug problems. “I live in Blackpool and one of the things I find upsetting is when people say, ‘Oh, this town is a tip’, because what are they doing to try and change things? Everybody has a role to play.”These days Johnny spends his time volunteering at Blackpool Fulfilling Lives, and is learning to drive. “I want to carry on volunteering for a bit and then work and get a job,” he says. “I want to help people turn their lives around, like people have helped me.” Although he has not always had the best time in Blackpool, he enjoys living there. “I love the atmosphere. I love the people. I loved growing up here. My family are here and I would never leave. I had bad times here, but that was my own doing. It was nothing to do with Blackpool.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3062cbcb3778149f99ef5ee242d01dddad104715/14_292_5817_3491/master/5817.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=736ac849a0ae3378cf57a3eee2893d7b 1240w","title":"flood gender pay data puts some companies defensive female workers dismay","story":"Many female workers express dismay at response as companies look to rebuild reputationsWhat began as a trickle became a torrent, carving out a new landscape in the world of work.With the last-minute flood of data as the gender pay gap deadline hit this week, some companies went on the defensive, reputation rehabilitation was under way, and canny headhunters began to flick through their Rolodexes.“I have heard that a lot of headhunters are now calling senior women and saying: ‘Would you be interested in a move? Some of your competitors have got lower gender pay gaps,’” said the gender pay gap consultant and expert Helene Reardon Bond. All companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u0026nbspreport their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office. All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.“It has changed the working landscape,” said Mark Crail, content director of XpertHR, an online advisory service that was inundated with queries from companies as the clock ticked down to 4 April. “And it’s very much a reputational issue.”From the trading floor to the shop floor, many women and men have been dismayed not just at the statistics but at their companies’ responses.“We started out as graduates equal to our male peers. As time goes by most men in my peer group have zoomed ahead in their careers, and I wonder what makes them so spectacular. It’s like the workplace is a game and men have the cheat sheets,” she said.Other women were puzzled at discovering that although they worked in companies with a majority female workforce the gap was still huge. Puzzlement turned to anger as some companies failed to communicate serious explanations.Coast said that its pay gap was the result of “the nature of our business”. It claimed that the difference between male and female pay had come about because “the majority of people who want to work for the brand are Coast customers themselves and therefore women”.The data, though not perfect, offered the first insight into inequality in the workforce on a company level anywhere in the world. It may have spawned “gender-gap deniers” and a slew of defensive company statements. But Labour’s Harriet Harman, who pushed through the legislation requiring companies with a 250-plus workforce, to publish their gender pay data, has been clear the transparency is a means to an end as a “spur to action”.The company used its communications portals – intranet, staff magazine and gender equality group – to drive debate. Senior managers have been involved from the get-go. Like similar retailers, there is a majority female population at shop floor level, with numbers thinning at the higher levels. Rather than use this an an excuse, or whinge that the method of collecting data was flawed, the company has focused on addressing the reasons behind its figures. “It has provided an opportunity to talk about issues such as more flexible working, and barriers to job-sharing at management level,” said David Hopkins, an HR manager at the company.Having to produce its data has set up what should be a positive dialogue. “As a company you could choose to do that in a positive way and use it as an opportunity, or you can set it up as an antagonistic point of contention that is left to fester. We have gone for the former,” he said.Reardon Bond, a former civil servant who worked on gender equality policy and is now a expert consultant in the field, said companies that failed to address the issue faced “massive reputational risk” and pressure from shareholders. The data highlighted the need to make flexible working for all a priority, and in particular in Stem (science, tech, engineering and maths) industries, where fewer women rise.Crail agreed that the reputational issue was the big driver for change, and employers needed to get to grips with what was driving the gap. “It’s not enough to say: ‘Oh, we’ve got lots in technology roles and that’s largely male’, or ‘we’ve got lots of men at the top and lots of women at the bottom’. That’s not an explanation, that’s just a description.”He said that any employers who failed to act were “really foolish”, not just because of what existing employees would think but also those they wanted to recruit.“All this is now public,” he said. It had irrevocably changed the working landscape. “It’s not going to go away. Perhaps a lot of people thought: ‘Oh well, we will report, there might be a bit of fuss and then it will die down.’ I really don’t think that is going to be the case,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e958c33f0fa6aa97d6cd971a23f4ad1dc5f4d38c/0_158_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e0f355c1a02450ef46059e9fc633b83d 1240w","title":"eric bristow personified darts golden age","story":"Eric Bristow was the high emperor of darts’ first golden age: brilliant and arrogant, admired and despised, a world champion and a pantomime villain rolled into one. During his 80s pomp he was a familiar sight on TV, with his red Crafty Cockney shirt and that magnificent Roman nose which would look down with disdain at his rivals and any hecklers in the crowd.Eight million watched Bristow win his first world title against Bobby George in 1980. Another 10 million saw his shock defeat by Keith Deller three years later. Darts was part of the sporting and cultural landscape – and Bristow was at the heart of it as he won five Embassy world titles in seven years.Perhaps that is why Bristow’s death, at the age of 60 after a heart attack on Thursday, has resonated so deeply. His name alone reminds us of those times: the smoke hugging the ceiling like a permanent mushroom cloud the players settling their nerves with a sip or two of a pint before each leg and Sid Waddell, the miner’s son who had won a scholarship to Cambridge, lighting up the TV commentary with his one-liners.As Waddell put it: “It was a magnificent subculture. Big guys with tattoos, who liked a pint and a bet. Leighton Rees from the Valleys, who lived with his mam Alan Evans, whose dad had a pub and used to stand him on a box to play at the age of eight. Later there was Deller, whose mum used to fry chips with one hand and throw darts with the other and Jocky Wilson, who would bring his own optic to tournaments, and a bottle of vodka with his name on it. He’d win darts matches when other people would have been in intensive care.”Once Waddell described the atmosphere of a Bristow match as being like “a cross between the Munich beer festival and the coliseum when the Christians were on the menu”. Needless to say, it was Bristow’s blood that the crowd were baying for.Most players would thud their darts in the board, as if trying to split an apple. Bristow, though, would caress his into the treble 20 bed with a strangely dainty action, little finger raised during his throw, like a waiter pouring a cup of tea from a great height.But at the peak of his powers he was struck down with dart-itis, a psychological condition that left him feeling that his darts were stuck in his hand. He tried seeing psychologists and even taking up fly-fishing to see if it would help. However, the answer, it turned out, lay closer to home.It was his partner, Maureen, who hit on a solution – suggesting he sponsor a local lad to practice with him for hours every day at their pub, the Crafty Cockney, in Stoke. Fortuitously Phil Taylor, then an engineer in his late 20s, volunteered and soon became his pal and protégé.Bristow saw Taylor’s potential and loaned him £10,000 so he could play in events. Once a delighted Taylor phoned him up after he finished runner-up in an event. “Phone me back when you win something,” Bristow told him, putting the phone down. Taylor repaid his mentor by qualifying for his first World Championship in 1990 – and then thrashing him in the final.Bristow was soon a fading force – and so was darts. First Greg Dyke, the controller of ITV, took it off his schedules. And by the early 1990s the BBC’s coverage had been reduced to the World Championships. Bristow was one of the 16 protagonists who in 1992 left to form a rival championship. For years the sport was in the doldrums but it is now enjoying its second golden age, thanks to Taylor’s brilliance on the board.Meanwhile Bristow, after he retired, became a ‘spotter’ and commentator for Sky Sports but was sacked in 2016 after he tweeted offensive comments about sexual abuse in football.He apologised the next day, adding that he “appreciated my wording was wrong and offended many people”. However, when his death was announced at a darts event in Liverpool on Thursday, the crowd starting singing “There’s only one Eric Bristow”. And judging by the outpouring of love and affection from those in and outside the sport, he is likely to be remembered for the good times most of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59f4eff7ae24a736e8ef223ee3c7d3408b674e3/0_69_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a9ef779dc4df0c33a4491c17b7e83e45 1240w","title":"f1 teams proposal cheaper louder engines 2021","story":"Lewis Hamilton faces a huge challenge to close Sebastian Vettel’s early lead in the world championship standings after receiving a five-place grid penalty due to a gearbox change the team had to institute after a hydraulics leak at the first round in Australia.A software error cost Hamilton a probable win in Melbourne as the Ferrari driver established a seven-point advantage with victory. After the race Mercedes admitted the British driver suffered a hydraulics leak, adding that he was fortunate to finish the race, let alone in second place.It means Hamilton will start only sixth even if he manages to post the quickest time in qualifying on Saturday.Kimi Räikkönen topped the time sheets in second practice at Bahrain, the only session that takes place in the evening and thus most representative of race conditions, ahead of his team-mate Vettel, with Valtteri Bottas in third and Hamilton in fourth. Daniel Ricciardo in the Red Bull was quickest in the afternoon during FP1.Meanwhile proposals for the future of Formula One including a cost cap and louder engines were received with general approval when presented to the teams on Friday.The sport’s owner, Liberty Media, unveiled its five-point plan outlining its vision of F1 for 2021. However, its objectives remain broad and a considerable and potentially difficult period of negotiation remains.Liberty’s blueprint was a distillation of concepts that have previously been aired by Ross Brawn, F1’s sporting director. The key points include cheaper, louder and simpler engines, that will be more attractive to new manufacturers, and a cost cap, understood to have been set at $150m. The big teams currently spend an estimated $300m.It also contains a proposal for revenue distribution to be more balanced, based on performance, and including a recognition of historical franchises and value – a reference to additional payments to teams such as Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull, above their share of performance revenue.There is also an intention to have cars better suited to race one another, making the driver the predominant factor and maintaining the unique design while standardising parts that are not relevant to fans.The proposals given to the teams are understood to have included more detail than was publicly released and are crucial to the future of the sport. Christian Horner, who has long been critical of the rules as they stand, was broadly optimistic.“The positive thing is they are focused on the fans,” he said. “On creating a better show, a more affordable F1. The big question is the devil in the detail. They have put big issues up but how is it going to be delivered?”Ferrari and Mercedes have previously expressed disquiet about the proposed changes with the former threatening to leave and the task now facing Liberty is reaching agreement with them.Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, believed it was a constructive starting point. “The positive of today is we know what their vision is,” he said. However, he was cautious about the proposed cost cap. “We need to work with Liberty and find a compromise, that number will not be achievable but we are all in the same financial reality.”“My priority is protecting our structure and our people. We have been here a long time and the same with Ferrari and Red Bull, so you need to ask how you can achieve a sustainable business model without having any hardship on anybody.”The teams below them on the grid, for whom this represents a chance to close what has become a vast gap to the top three, were unsurprisingly positive. Claire Williams, the Williams deputy team principal, was enthusiastic. “Everything they presented from revenue redistribution to cost cap is absolutely everything we want to see from 2021 and beyond,” she said. “I’m personally delighted at the proposals.”McLaren’s executive director, Zak Brown, concurred. “I think the direction they’re taking is the right direction,” he said. “The sport starts with the fan and that’s what Liberty are focused on. We all recognise the sport is not where it needs to be today, so it’s in our collective interest to improve the show.”Brawn has described the current regulations as a deterrent to new teams and his plans met with approval from Andy Palmer, the head of Aston Martin. “These prospective changes support many of the requirements needed for Aston Martin to enter the sport as an engine supplier. This is a very positive step in the right direction,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6db3a25427d1a1a0b4b9a0051d0a8db99bcb23e6/81_227_3328_1996/master/3328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e6fb222fd40aa913e67d76ae3c81b2eb 1240w","title":"rory mcilroy second round masters jordan spieth","story":"Rory McIlroy did not have to search for a Friday reminder of Augusta National’s recurring capacity to inflict psychological torture on world class golfers.Jon Rahm, playing in the company of McIlroy and Adam Scott, did not take kindly to a bunker shot which flew over the back of a green. In specific order Rahm smashed his wedge into the sand, threw said club away, booted his bag, retrieved the club and, having holed out for a bogey four, tossed his ball into a hedge. The Spaniard had played only four holes.That McIlroy has encountered so many trying times in the first major of the year added to the sense of what he accomplished on day two. Augusta National is probably the most passively aggressive venue in the world, as endorsed by menacing pin positions which, combined with wind, leave competitors grasping desperately for air. Standing still represented progress. Patience was rewarded. Enter McIlroy, who produced a 71 which, in terms of context if not bare statistics, represented one of his finest rounds here. McIlroy has been unflappable during a tough opening 36 holes and he felt that this 18-hole stretch should have yielded more points to the legitimate ambition of a four-time major champion.McIlroy’s round had got off to the kind of start which suggested a long day’s work. In previous years it would have been. He three-putted the 1st for a bogey and found sand from the 2nd tee. The response owed so much to mental fortitude the 28-year-old converted from 30ft for a surprise birdie and collected a further shot at the 3rd. He had dropped back to an aggregate of two under at the 12th before producing birdies at the 13th and 14th a 27ft putt sealed the latter. From there the Northern Irishman displayed calmness to ease home with a series of pars. His halfway total is four under.“I’m pretty happy,” said McIlroy. “I feel I could have shot in the 60’s but overall 71 out there was a pretty good score. I’m in a nice position going into the weekend. I’ve always felt comfortable around the lead, it’s a place I’m thankfully familiar with.”McIlroy was undecided as to whether he would have taken this scenario before a competitive ball was struck. “I’m happy with how I have felt and handled certain things, how my thought process has been. That’s been pleasing.”For now, McIlroy and co must hunt down the inspired Patrick Reed. The Texan hadn’t broken 70 in 12 Augusta rounds before this week. How that has altered Reed backed up Thursday’s 69 with a stunning 66. At nine under, he leads Marc Leishman by two. Henrik Stenson’s afternoon charge propelled him to five under.In providing a blue-chip complexion to the leaderboard which grew stronger as Friday progressed - slowly - Jordan Spieth recovered from slipping to three over par after two holes to card a 74. He shares McIlroy’s aggregate. Spieth recounted a key chat with his caddie, Michael Greller, on the 3rd tee.“I’ve taken a lot of punches on this golf course, and in tournaments in general,” Spieth said. “I told Michael, ‘Look, when this course plays tough, I’m good for a double here or some bogeys there. Let’s make these the only ones.’ He was really good at saying, ‘Man, you always take punches out here and come back stronger.’”Dustin Johnson is a shot adrift of McIlroy and Spieth with the world No1’s second round of 68 notable as a five-stroke improvement from Thursday. Justin Thomas matched Johnson’s minus three. Rickie Fowler is at two under as he continues pursuit of a first major success as overdue. Justin Rose, defeated in a Masters play-off 12 months ago, and Bubba Watson sit alongside Rickie Fowler on a board now dominated by major winners.If forecasts are to be believed, heavy rain and thunder storms will hit this corner of Georgia on Saturday. That being the case, the tournament dynamic will shift once more. Tiger Woods will form a part of it. Having flirted with the five over cut line, the 14-time major winner played his closing 13 holes in level when piecing together a 75 and total of plus four. Woods won’t win, but his unforeseen comeback continues.Phil Mickelson had been just one from the lead when standing on the 9th tee. What followed entered the realms of circus. The left-hander cracked the centre of a tree from pine straw when playing his second shot, found his ball in a bed of azaleas and wracked up a seven. A birdie at the 10th was cancelled out - and some - by a bogey at the 11th and the double bogeying of the 12th. He later signed for a 79. “It was a rough day,” said Mickelson. Rahm, incidentally, shot 68 perhaps green jackets and red mist do mix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fd1fdfde31e66d1d7963a1996286949b2b9a97/0_201_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0017d1d85a7f647e2e2756842ecf83b2 1240w","title":"conor mcgregor ufc felony assault charges","story":"The Irishman’s tiresome act is doing more to destroy the UFC’s hard-won credibility than any stomach-turning brawl or failed doping testWatching Conor McGregor racing through the loading dock at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Thursday, throwing dollies at a bus like some crazy-eyed hooligan, I could only think of John McCain.It was the US senator who years ago denounced the UFC as “human cockfighting”, affixing a label of lawlessness on mixed martial arts that pushed them into the corners of what was considered acceptable adult behavior. The UFC has worked for years to combat this image, with brain safety and doping mandates that helped attract a corporate buyer and led McCain to reconsider his opinion. “The MMA cleaned up their act, they really did,” McCain told me in 2016. “When it first started they were able to do things that are now prohibited. I don’t have a problem with the MMA.”Now the UFC’s biggest name, their star who burst into the mainstream, landing on magazine covers, luring many to a sport they’d never might have never considered, has been charged with assault and criminal mischief. One of these counts is a felony. And it does far more than any bloody brawl or failed doping test to destroy the credibility the UFC has built in recent years. The videos of the organization’s most visible fighter raging across concrete corridors, hurling garbage cans, project to the world an image that confirms McCain’s original impression.What does it say about the UFC when the only fighter to hold titles in two of its isions at once starts acting a common hoodlum?Two years ago, back when he still came off as clever, McGregor once sat in a pre-fight press conference with Nate Diaz and said Diaz had “a bully mentality”. He then mocked Diaz’s mentors – some of whom are MMA royalty – as “bums.” As he said this, McGregor wore a fine plaid suit. He looked elegant. And even though he tussled with Diaz on stage, he still came off as regal, the fighter with an uncanny ability to describe exactly how he would win his fights. For this he became known as “Mystic Mac”.But there was nothing mystical or magical about the man bellowing through Barclays with a posse of sycophants, scampering from security, flinging anything not bolted down at a bus filled with other fighters. When he threw the dolly through the bus window, he allegedly injured lightweight fighter Michael Chiesa and flyweight Ray Borg enough that both were pulled from Saturday’s UFC 233 card. McGregor came off as the very things he once decried: a bully and a bum.Maybe, in a way, this was some kind of extravagant fight promotion. The real target of McGregor’s ire was supposedly Khabib Nurmagomedov, the rising lightweight star whose fight with Max Holloway on Saturday night was for the belt McGregor was stripped of for not fighting in the UFC since November 2016. McGregor was once a master of hype, building hysteria for his fights with profane tirades. What happened Thursday was no masterful stroke of promotional genius. McGregor’s act has grown tiresome in recent months as his star has peaked and he almost seems to have developed a compulsion to be outrageous. He looked tacky and obnoxious in his pre-fight tour with Floyd Mayweather before their fight last year and in dragging his gang of hangers-on to charge a bus under an arena two days before a big fight night was stupid. There’s no honor in getting arrested for potentially damaging the careers of other fighters. McGregor, a man obsessed with money, should understand that. With Chiesa and Borg’s withdrawls and UFC president Dana White’s removal of Artem Lobov (who was with McGregor on Thursday), he may have cost the UFC three fights on Saturday’s card. When Holloway was declared medically unfit to fight on Friday morning, the UFC was left with a shell of an event. “This is the last stunt on earth that we’d ever pull,” White told ESPN.“This is embarrassing for the sport and obviously for the UFC. This is the furthest thing from a stunt. This is bad. Times have changed. This isn’t the old anything-goes UFC. The work White and others did to polish the organization’s image resulted in a $4bn sale to WME-IMG. The modern UFC is not the renegade UFC. They are a huge corporate entity desperate to appeal to the mainstream. What McGregor did on Thursday might draw a knowing smile from a fight fan who will shrug the whole thing off a part of “fighting”. But it doesn’t appeal to the broader world that puts people like McGregor and former female star Ronda Rousey on magazine covers and television commercials. “It’s out of character for Conor McGregor and any of my fighters,” White said in his ESPN interview, looking shaken by what happened. “Listen, crazy things happen in sports. ... In the history of the UFC, this is definitely the worst thing that’s happened. This is not Conor McGregor. This is not the Conor McGregor that I know.”UFC executives have been frustrated with McGregor ever since he knocked out José Aldo in 13 seconds back in UFC 194. The win propelled McGregor to new fame, making him almost bigger than the organization himself – something he exploited to become increasing more difficult to control. They put up with his behavior because, for a time, it made them money. But this time McGregor crossed a line. White is right, the McGregor of recent months, the McGregor on Thursday, was nothing like the one who became the UFC’s greatest star. He has to make a choice now.

Today’s medal events – some of which have already been contested – are in cycling, swimming, gymnastics, triathlon and weightlifting and Australia will be hoping to continue yesterday’s astonishing dominance in the pool, although England’s Adam Peaty is the hot favourite to win the men’s 100m breaststroke. THere’s already been one massive upset in the velodrome, where Aussie world champion Matthew Glaetzer is out of the men’s sprint. Despite setting a new world record in the heats, Glaetzer lost to Malaysia’s Muhammad Sahrom in the 18 finals. That’s all from me for now. To the disappointment of nobody, it’s over to the people’s champion, Barry Glendenning.Just a reminder for what to keep an eye out for this evening on the Gold Coast.An Aboriginal group marched through the centre of Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast on Saturday, continuing their protest against the hosting of the 2018 Commonwealth Games.Scenes! Pakistan come back from 2-0 down to draw level with India at 2-2. Wow! After watching Smith and Pretorius duke it out for silver and bronze Maude Charron strolls out and lifts 117kg over her head like it’s a twiglet to claim as dominant a gold medal as you could wish to see. Seriously impressive from the Canadian. Now, can she go on to break any records? She’s attempting 122kg to set a new Commonwealth Games clean-and-jerk record and equal the combined record of 220kg. YES! At her second attempt, the final lift of the event, Charron adds the cherry to the top of the cake.YES! Superb lift from Zoe Smith to lead the women’s 63kg weightlifting before Maude Charron takes to the stage. Guaranteed a least a silver for England. Credit to Pretorius for a superb battle. Bosh! Pretorius has just smashed a personal best 115kg in her final lift for a pure six out of six for the event. Can Smith match her?The women’s 63kg weightlifting final is now a three-way contest. Maude Charron is yet to attempt a clean-and-jerk but she is in pole position for gold. Behind her South Africa’s Mona Pretorius (203kg) and England’s Zoe Smith (204kg) are in a ding-dong for silver. This is a great contest. We’re nearing the business end of the women’s 63kg weightlifting final. Northern Ireland’s Emma McQuaid is in front on 182kg but the four leading lifters from the snatch component have yet to attempt the clean-and-jerk. We’ve been enjoying quarterfinals in the team table tennis today with India and England joining Australia and Singapore in the final four of the women’s event. In the men’s only two quarters have taken place so far with India thrashing Malaysia and Singapore scraping past Canada. Some swimming news coming through. England’s James Guy has withdrawn from tonight’s 200m butterfly final. The decorated 22-year old is being treated for dehydration but should be fit to compete later in the meet. Canada’s Maude Charron is leading the women’s 63kg weightlifting final at the halfway stage. The world championship silver medalist snatched 98kg to lead England’s Zoe Smith (92kg) and South Africa’s Mona Pretorious (91kg). Only six lifters snatched over 80kg. The field has been reduced from 13 to 12 ahead of the clean-and-jerk phase because Australian veteran Seen Lee failed to register a weight.India vs. Pakistan is a contest that matters whatever the sport and it’s on again in Pool B of the men’s hockey. India lead 2-0 in the second period. The next gold medal on offer is in the weightlifting. We’re approaching halfway in the women’s 63kg final. Drama in the cycling! Australia’s Matthew Glaetzer is out of the men’s sprint in a barely believable upset. Glaetzer, word champion in this event, set a new world record in the heats but contrived to lose to Malaysia’s Muhammad Sahrom in the 18 finals. England benefited from Australia’s poor fortune to secure both available gold medals during the inaugural Commonwealth Games PTWC Triathlon.Joe Townsend finished first in the men’s race, helped in no small part by five-time world champion Bill Chaffey suffering a nasty crash midway through the race.In the women’s race Jade Jones took advantage of Lauren Parker’s technical issues to become the event’s first female gold medalist. 25-year old Sathish Kumar Sivalingam defended the 77kg weightlifting gold medal he won in Glasgow, lifting 317 kg in total, 144 kg in snatch and 173 kg in Clean-and-Jerk. This was India’s third weightlifting gold of the games, following the pair already secured by Sanjita Chanu Khumukcham.Let’s catch up on the medals already handed out today.The English gymnastics team is a tight bunch and it showed again today with Nile Wilson pipping teammate James Hall to the All-Around Inidual gold medal. Hall was leading heading into Wilson’s final attempt on the horizontal bar, but still cheered his teammate on from the edge of the arena.“That was one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had,” Wilson said afterwards. “It was a battle on the high bar. You can’t write it, to finish the way like it did. That was one of the best high bars I have put together.”Wilson and Hall had already combined for gold in the men’s team final on Thursday.Gold for Australia! Jacob Birtwhistle completes the job for Australia, crossing the line with a boxing kangaroo flag in hand. Birtwhistle is joined in a four-way embrace by teammates Ashleigh Gardner, Matt Hauser and Gillian Backhouse. Gardner in particular deserves enormous credit for her third leg that decided this race.New Zealand are a long way behind in the bronze medal position, a few seconds ahead of Canada. Jacob Birtwhistle is cruising out in front of the mixed teams triathlon. He steps off his bike and into his running shoes with a 25-second lead over Alistair Brownlee. The 1.5k run is Birtwhistle’s strongest leg so Brownlee, the dual Olympic gold medalist, would have to do something miraculous to make up the time. The mixed team triathlon is dominating attention at the moment. It is a head-to-head battle between England and Australia approaching the final leg. To recap: teams are comprised of four triathletes - two male, two female - with each completing a 250m swim, a 7km cycle and a 1500m run.England’s line-up contains both Brownlee brothers but they may have to settle for silver because on the third leg Ashleigh Gentle of Australia has turned a minor deficit into an enormous lead over England’s Jess Learmonth, who rolled her ankle transitioning from the bike to the run.Hi there! Welcome to day three.Australia continued its domination of Gold Coast 2018 yesterday as the action remained centred on the pool and the velodrome. Of the 17 gold medals awarded eight went to the hosts. Three locals now have multiple golds. There were stories to celebrate elsewhere, including student cycling star Charlie Tanfield, and the City of Derby swimming club. There’s plenty of action to get to today, including the distribution of 22 gold medals, so let’s e straight in.England have started strongly, taking out gold and silver in the Men’s Inidual All-Around Gymnastics final, adding to golds in both the men’s and women’s PTWC Triathlon. India collected its third weightlifting gold. Here’s what’s still to come on day three. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.As always, if you would like to join in the conversation, please send emails to: jonathan.howcroft.freelance@guardian.co.uk or tweet me @JPHowcroft.

They’re not getting itI work in a school for children with social and emotional difficulties. Many have been excluded from or struggled to cope in mainstream education. Much of the work we do makes a real difference: home visits, running parental workshops, holding multi-agency meetings and attending court are all a vital part of the holistic package of care we give these vulnerable young people. To me, though, it feels like a piece of the jigsaw is missing. On the surface, the message is “high expectations for all”, but the reality seems to be quite the opposite. Rather than pushing our students to achieve, my school finds excuses to avoid focusing on outcomes.It employs devious tricks to inflate success – using baseline tests pitched at a low level so we can show better progress later – and plays on the fact that we’re a special educational needs school to justify narrowing the curriculum. This means featuring only core and vocational subjects, despite these pupils being more than capable of studying languages, humanities and creative arts. This has nothing to do with the increasing focus in mainstream education on English and maths and everything to do with the assumption that our “type” of pupils wouldn’t see the point in or enjoy these subjects. For some of our students, this lack of breadth is just what they need. We offer a vocational route for those suited to it, and they get a chance to make something of themselves. The young people I worry about are those who have enormous academic potential, and would like to pursue other routes. We are letting these students down.Soon after I joined the school I voiced my concerns. I knew that the pupils were capable of reading a whole book and enjoying it, for instance, but was told by the leadership team that “these kids don’t like reading”. I was advised to give them extracts and “mix it up a bit”. This assumption about students’ preferences doesn’t tally with my observations. There’s the pupil with severe dyslexia who comes to my classroom most lunchtimes to read an 800-page novel. Or the one who took home the book I gave them and read it cover to cover. When students have been encouraged in this way, I’ve seen their belief in their potential grow.The school’s approach to behaviour compounds the problem. It’s commonplace for students to walk out of lessons because they don’t like a topic or “need” a smoke. There’s always a reason for why they haven’t finished their essay. We accept the excuse that students have only written a paragraph because that’s all they felt able to manage, and end up being almost grateful that they have produced anything. Dramatic incidents are kept to a minimum, and nobody wants to rock the boat.Dumbing down the curriculum and lowering our expectations in this way perpetuates the self-fulfilling prophecy that these pupils can’t achieve academically. If they say “I can’t do it” and we say “You don’t have to”, surely something is very wrong?We allow ourselves to think we’ve empowered these pupils by focusing on soft outcomes. But we’re holding them back from being the best they can be.Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join the Guardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inboxLooking for a teaching job?

On Friday, Facebook was again under fire, both over the discovery that the company has a two-tiered privacy standard (one for executives, one for everyone else) and over its use of facial recognition software.TechCrunch reported late Thursday that Facebook has been using a secret tool to delete messages sent by its executives from the inboxes of their recipients, without disclosing the deletions to the recipients or even recording there was ever a message in the first place.Effectively, this means if you send Mark Zuckerberg a Facebook message, he has a copy for ever. But if he sends you one, he can reach into your inbox and pluck it out of existence.Facebook says the change was made following the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, when a mass data breach at the movie studio resulted in embarrassing email histories being leaked for a number of executives, ultimately costing co-chair Amy Pascal her job.“After Sony Pictures’ emails were hacked in 2014 we made a number of changes to protect our executives’ communications,” Facebook told TechCrunch. “These included limiting the retention period for Mark’s messages in Messenger. We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.”But the lack of disclosure angered some Facebook users, as has the absence of any similar tool for regular users. Since 2016, Facebook users have been able to send disappearing messages using an encryption feature in Messenger, but they cannot turn the tool on retroactively, and cannot erase any sent messages older than 2016. On Friday morning, the company apologized and pledged to stop deleting executives’ messages until they could make the same functionality available to everyone. “We should have done this sooner – and we’re sorry that we did not,” a Facebook spokesperson said by email. The company did not immediately respond to a question about whether or not it had other secret privacy tools for executives. Also on Friday, a coalition of privacy and consumer groups filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) arguing that Facebook’s “unwanted, unnecessary, and dangerous” use of facial recognition software violates both users’ privacy and the company’s 2011 FTC consent decree with the regulator. Facebook was already under investigation by the FTC due to the Cambridge Analytica data breach. Facebook’s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, defended the technology in a statement. “People can choose whether or not to allow this technology and they can change their mind at any time,” Sherman said. “When someone has their setting turned off, we don’t use this technology to identify them in photos.”Just before noon on Friday, Facebook, in its latest attempt to appease the public, announced new rules for political ads to address the controversy over foreign interference in elections that has also dogged the company. The flurry of news overshadowed Sandberg’s apology tour, which followed a similar parade for Zuckerberg earlier in the week.“We made mistakes and I own them and they are on me,” Sandberg told the Financial Times. “There are operational things that we need to change in this company and we are changing them. We have to learn from our mistakes and we need to take action.”Her comments echoed Zuckerberg’s earlier statement that the Cambridge Analytica data breach was “my responsibility … I started this place. I run it. And I am responsible for what happens here.”Speaking to CNBC, Sandberg suggested that Facebook users may one day be able to opt out of having their data mined by the company altogether – but that they would have to pay for the privilege.The company has “different forms of opt out” she said, but not a one-stop shop. “We don’t have an opt-out at the highest level. That would be a paid product,” Sandberg said.Sandberg also shone some more light on a second apparent data crisis at Facebook: the news that “most” of the company’s billions of accounts have had their data “scraped” by unknown third parties abusing a user search tool.“We had a feature we could look up people by name or email, and that was important for finding people”, Sandberg said to Bloomberg. “And someone made a directory they shouldn’t have made with that information. But to be very clear and specific all of that was public information. That was information that was already publicly available on Facebook.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298f62f2a36f47ba5dbd1259eb0552dec7050eba/0_871_3413_2048/master/3413.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f846f3a1afe37e9ffe676b935b2ebb97 2600w","title":"dordogne france holiday guide best restaurants hotels","story":"The food, wine and idyllic lifestyle of this region’s villages have always appealed to Brits – and with Brexit looming they’re settling in record numbers – but that has not dimmed its thoroughly French allureThe Dordogne comes close to offering everything that travellers head to France for: beautiful chateaux, traditional French gastronomy, a bucolic landscape of vineyards, forests and rivers. Picturesque fortified villages, such as Beynac, La Roque Gageac and Eymet (site of an unexpected pre-Brexit boom for UK settlers), and charming towns such as Bergerac, Brantôme, Bourdeilles and Ribérac, have long been popular with Brits wanting to settle in France, and this is one part of the country where they have always been warmly welcomed into local communities.Sarlat-la-Canéda is the perfect base for exploring the grandiose hilltop châteaux that look down on the Dordogne river and the Unesco-listed prehistoric sites along the Vézère valley. Its narrow streets are lined with lavish sandstone mansions, perfectly preserved since the middle ages and Renaissance. Don’t miss taking a ride up the 14th-century bell tower, where renowned architect and Sarlat local Jean Nouvel has designed a panoramic glass lift offering 360-degree views.Each of the Dordogne’s landmark castles has something different to discover. The immense Château de Castelnaud (€10.80) is perfect for kids, with its remarkable collection of medieval armaments, while the equally majestic Château de Beynac (€8), above a stone village that tumbles down to the river, was a location for Luc Besson’s 1999 Joan of Arc movie. The ornate, chocolate-box Château des Milandes used to belong to dancer and activist Josephine Baker, and houses an incredible museum about her life. In a tranquil valley is the breathtaking Château de Commarque (€8.50), a towering mass of ruins above ancient cave dwellings.Garden-lovers should leave time for two of France’s most famous formal gardens. The Jardins Suspendus at Marqueyssac (€9.80) are a magical maze of 150,000 swirling, looping box hedges, while those at the Manoir d’Eyrignac (€12.50) are more English in style, including an extravagant perfumed rose garden.The Dordogne’s incredible prehistoric sites are principally along the Vézère river. Kick off at Les Eyzies, spectacularly hewn into the cliffside, with a tour of the Prehistoric Museum (€6€4.50 ). On the other side of the river from Les Eyzies, a rickety staircase disappears into the Grotte du Grand Roc (€8.20), a vast cavern filled with stalactites and stalagmites, while La Roque Saint-Christophe (€8.75) is a kitsch but fascinating reconstitution of a kilometre-long cave village cut high into a cliff, inhabited 55,000 years ago by Neanderthals.Nothing quite prepares for a visit to Lascaux (€16), especially since the recent opening of a new £50m centre complete with futuristic multimedia special effects and interactive iPad guides. This is the second recreation of these caves and their 600 prehistoric wall paintings. The original site, discovered in 1940, closed to the public in 1963 to protect the fragile Cro Magnon artwork known as the “Sistine chapel of prehistory”. The new Lascaux is attracting huge crowds, with tour groups leaving every six minutes, so consider visiting the quieter, original Lascaux II complex (€12), which is frankly just as impressive a recreation of the original caves.Sarlat is the undisputed foodie capital of the Dordogne, with tempting, affordable restaurants serving regional specialities such as succulent duck magret and confit, and omelettes bursting with girolle mushrooms. It’s difficult to beat the honest home cooking at Le Bistrot, which does a two-course €14 set lunch or €14-€18 main dishes in the evening, when diners sit out opposite buskers, clowns and acrobats performing outside the towering gothic cathedral.Sarlat is surrounded by great-value traditional fermes auberges (farm inns). At La Table du Chaffour, Nicole and Jean-Marie Verlhiac grow vegetables, raise ducks and geese, and use only their own produce for the hearty three-course €15 menu tradition or the six-dish €29 menu gastronomique.In the hills above Château Montfort is the no-frills Pech de Malet hotel, whose sunny terrace has awe-inspiring vistas over the Dordogne valley, perfect for a sunset aperitif, with house wine at €6.50 a bottle, accompanied by a €6.80 plate of irresistible pommes sarladaises, thinly sliced potatoes sautéed with garlic, parsley and cep mushrooms.Restaurants around the caves of Les Eyzies tend to be aimed mostly at tourists, but just outside the village, talented chef Pascal Lombard has opened the casual Bistrot Les Glycines. Working from an open kitchen, Pascal’s young team prepare a €17 three-course lunch menu with creative dishes such as salmon rillettes topped with edible flowers and root vegetables, and grilled duck hearts.A tour of Lascaux takes around half a day, and rather than looking for food in the nearby villager of Montigny, visitors can choose between the brasserie, snacking and cafe options at the centre’s excellent Cafe Lascaux, with prices ranging from a €9 salad to the €15.90 set lunch.You can’t get more central in Sarlat than the main square above the town’s most popular cafe, Le Glacier (€90 B\u0026ampB). The four bedrooms are enormous, with double glazing so you are not kept awake by the late-night crowds drinking below. The idyllic landscapes around the castles and caves of the Dordogne and Vézère rivers offer dozens of chambre d’hôtes (B\u0026ampBs), catering to all budgets.To splash out for a night in a romantic setting, two addresses stand out: the monumental 13th-century Château de Puymartin (doubles from €150 B\u0026ampB) has two stately rooms with antique furniture, while the more ornate Château de Monrecour (doubles from €120 room-only) has recently become a 10-room hotel, with hot-air balloons taking off from the gardens from time to time.On the road to Lascaux are two very different B\u0026ampBs: the chic Maison de Marquay (doubles from €90 B\u0026ampB) in the middle of a tiny village, where owner Gérard Lerchundi prepares a gourmet €33 dinner each night and the rustic Pech Mortier (€55 B\u0026ampB), in the countryside by Marcillac-Saint-Quentin.A few miles from Lascaux is Condat-sur-Vézère, where sumptuous 13th-century L’Hostellerie de la Commanderie (doubles €110), is in beautiful wooded gardens with swimming pool and a breakfast room decorated with glittering candelabras.• More B\u0026ampBs at sarlat-tourisme.comBergerac comes to life on Wednesday and Saturday mornings, when its narrow medieval streets are taken over by a market. Stock up for a picnic in the surrounding vineyards with organic tomatoes, saucisson packed with hazelnuts and fragrant strawberries. Bergerac is at the heart of affordable and welcoming wine country. It’s easy to follow a Route des Vins around the rolling vine-clad hills, discovering little-known reds such as Pécharmant and the luscious Monbazillac dessert wine.Enoy your picnic in the gardens of the Renaissance Château de Monbazillac but skip its touristy tasting sessions and head instead to the equally imposing Château de Bélingard to try its fruity €5.90 Bergerac Blanc. You may well bump into the estate’s garrulous owner, Laurent, Comte de Bosredon, who will tell you how wine has been made here since the days of the Celts.Halfway between Bergerac and Périgueux, take a side trip to Domaine de Neuvic, a fish farm with a difference as it harvests sturgeon eggs to produce caviar. For €19, visitors get a tour of the farm and see some seriously enormous sturgeons, plus a spoonful of caviar and a glass of bubbly. Périgueux is the capital of the Dordogne and is dominated by the swirling domes and turrets of its white Saint Front cathedral. Inspired by St Mark’s Basilica in Venice, the present building looks similar to the Sacre-Coeur in Paris – not surprising because it was restyled in the 19th century by the same architect.The same distinctive white stone is even more conspicuous in another of the Dordogne’s jewels, medieval Brantôme, almost entirely encircled by a meander of the Dronne river. Brantôme’s massive Benedictine abbey was founded in AD769 by the emperor Charlemagne, and behind it are some much older troglodyte caves, with haunting religious wall carvings.Hire a kayak (€10) or paddleboard (€12) (brantomecanoe.com) for a couple of hours to do a lazy tour of the city or take the whole day and paddle seven kilometres upriver to Bourdeilles, where a fortified chateau (€8.70) houses an enormous collection of antique furniture and tapestries.In Monbazillac, the welcoming Maison Vari is owned by a local vigneron (wine maker). Château Vari wines can be tasted for free at the bar, or there are tables in the garden of this friendly cafe-wine bar for indulging in generous €10 plates of charcuterie and local cheeses with a chilled bottle of organic €12 Bergerac blanc or rosé.In Périgueux, head straight for the town’s historic covered market on Place du Coderc. It was already a foodie paradise but now it boasts the Bistrot de la Halle, a minuscule diner where a glass of wine is the perfect accompaniment to freshly shucked oysters or a hamburger au foie gras.Brantôme caters for all budgets, from the Michelin-starred Moulin de l’Abbaye, to the cheap-and-cheerful Co’Thé-Café , where a homemade soup, quiche and salad costs €7.50. Alternatively, sit out on the river bank at Comme à la Maison (13 quai Bertin, +33 9 8051 6833, no website), where owner Sarah Nicolas serves a €16 three-course lunch with seasonal, organic products.There are numerous winemaker B\u0026ampBs dotted across the Bergerac area, with an especially warm welcome at Domaine du Boyer (doubles from €66 B\u0026ampB). Yannick Dumonteil and his Vietnamese wife, Ghislaine, make guests feel they’re part of the family and run cellar tours with tastings of their wines – and there’s a family swimming pool surrounded by vines.Rather than looking for a place to stay in busy Périgueux, carry on to Brantôme, where Sandrine Laby has a cosy four-room B\u0026ampB, Au Nid des Thés (€90 B\u0026ampB), right above her salon de thé, with a sunny roof terrace for breakfast, where she serves home-baked cakes and a choice of 30 teas.Take the lovely 10km drive south-west along the Dronne to medieval Bourdeilles, crossing an ancient stone bridge to enter the village. Here, the venerable Hostellerie les Griffons (doubles from €95, breakfast €13) sits right on the river. Old-fashioned but charming, this 16th-century auberge has 10 rustic-beamed rooms, as well as a small pool.For a more outdoorsy experience, carry on to the north of the Dordogne, where Parenthèses Imaginaires (cabins sleeping 2, from €110 a night, minimum two nights) is a sprawling campsite with a lake and thick forest. Dynamic young owner Francoise has created an eco-glamping resort, with romantic lakeside wooden chalets and areas for tents and vehicles (pitches from €20 for two nights).Ryanair flies to Bergerac from Liverpool, Stansted and East Midlands Flybe flies from Birmingham, Southampton, Exeter and Edinburgh. Bordeaux is 90 minutes from Bergerac by car. Travelling by train (from London to Bordeaux, changing in Paris) costs from around £170 return on Eurostar. Bergerac is 530 miles from Calais and 360 miles from Caen.Easter until late autumn is peak season, with many gardens in full bloom. The average high temperature in Bergerac ranges from 20C to 28C between May and October, falling to 10C in January.

The city’s Roman history is well-trodden, but Roberts explores a new theory – that Rome intended Chester to be not just the capital of occupied Britain, but a staging post for a conquest of Ireland. Andrew MuellerThe Danish hostage thriller concludes in a way that’s more sad than exciting, since there’s a very Nordic trade-off in which all the characters are given sympathy and a degree of closure at the expense of some spectacle. The final negotiations do, however, bring the odd jolt of life-or-death tension.

Although two maps, one placed on top of the other, then held up to the light, might be of some help. This is The City and the City, a four-part adaptation of China Miéville’s award-winning, sci-fidetective-fiction hybrid that began on BBC Two last night. It’s about the murder investigation that ensues when a foreign exchange student turns up dead in the fictional European city of Besźel. Or is that the fictional European city of Ul Qoma? Or perhaps both at the same time?Both cities exist in the same physical space, but remain distinct because citizens of one are taught from childhood to “unsee” the people, buildings and events of the other. Anyone caught crossing these psychological borders, or “breaching”, risks punishment from a merciless and all-powerful authority, confusingly referred to as “Breach”. In this shadowy, chimeric place, the square-shouldered David Morrissey is an almost comically solid presence as Inspector Tyador Borlú. He has a weakness for the company of his wife (Sherlock’s Lara Pulver playing another mysterious woman), but is an otherwise gruff, by-the-book cop, dogged in his pursuit of justice. Borlú? Get caught breaching in the disputed zone? Don’t be so bloody daft!And if such straight talk offends, best get used to it now, because Borlú’s sidekick Constable Corwi (Mandeep Dhillon) swears like a Sex Pistol let loose on live television. Suspects and superior officers alike get pelted with f-bombs in her presence it’s kind of her thing. Happily, previews suggest there’s a more promising The Bridge-style team-up with Borlú’s Ul Qoman opposite number in the next episode. More decorous is the Beszélian extreme crime squad boss, Commissar Gadlem (Ron Cook). His thing is a thick moustache and Deirdre Barlow glasses combo, which commands respect even among this macho crowd. Yep, the 1970s Istanbul look is very “in” in Besźel. Here, the propaganda flyers feature umlauts and cedillas, the soft furnishings are various shades of orange and brown and everyone smokes indoors. This post-Soviet exoticism is one way the series attempts to realise the novel’s seemingly unfilmable premise, rendering the coexistent unseen city as blurry images at the edge of the frame. Miéville’s metaphor for modern life remains clear, however. Don’t we all habitually “unsee” various examples of the unpleasantly seedy or inconveniently needy on our way from A to B? Channel 4’s The Handmaid’s Tale has already proved it’s possible to translate a richly imagined dystopia from page to small screen, but so far, this flat-footed adaptation has apparently been held up at the border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05cb389ba935b5b7ee19fd00c82ffab608cc5ab7/0_133_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f136368ad2f67e372fe87fd76c39393e 1240w","title":"facebook suspends aggregate iq cambridge analytica vote leave brexit","story":"AggregateIQ, which played a pivotal role in the Brexit campaign, suspended after reports it may have improperly obtained user data On Friday, Facebook announced it had suspended AggregateIQ (AIQ) from its platform following reports the company may be connected to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL.In its statement, Facebook said: “In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate. “Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities.”The company played a critical role in Britain’s European referendum with four different campaigns employing its services and spending a total of £3.5m: Vote Leave, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party. Additionally, it did work for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump, and the US senators Thom Tillis and Ted Cruz.The Observer first revealed links between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ last May. Two weeks ago, Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told how he had help set up the company when he asked his friends in his home town of Victoria, British Columbia, to come and work with Cambridge Analytica. AIQ has denied Wylie had any involvement in setting up the company.At that time, AIQ removed a quote from Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s chief strategist, from the home page of its website. Previously, it had said: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.”Ten days ago, Wylie gave evidence about AIQ to MPs on the department of culture, media and sport select committee and also handed over legal documents that showed the connections between it and SCL Elections, including two contracts and an IP licence as well as an email between Jeff Silvester, the cofounder of AIQ, and Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.The email, about the campaign for Bolton, referenced Aleksandr Kogan and the Facebook data he had harvested on Cambridge Analytica’s behalf.Last week, AIQ told the Observer it was not a direct part andor the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica and that it had not been involved the exploitation of Facebook data.The company is already intertwined in an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which in November reopened an investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave had given its youth campaign, BeLeave, saying there were “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”.It is perfectly legal for one campaign to donate to another if they are separate, but the donation went straight from Vote Leave to AIQ and a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, a 22-year-old volunteer with BeLeave, told the Observer that they had no control over how the money was spent. Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant to electoral law. When the Electoral Commission first looked at this in March 2017 it agreed with Vote Leave. The Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is leading another investigation into the use of data in the referendum, said: “AggregateIQ has not been especially cooperative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.” AIQ says it has answered all the questions put to it by the Electoral Commission.Both Dom Cummings, the chief strategist for Vote Leave, and Darren Grimes of BeLeave, told the paper he found the firm – which has just 20 staff that operated out of a cramped office above an opticians in the Canadian city of Victoria, 4,760 miles away – “on the internet”.But cached searches show AggregateIQ did not show up in Google searches at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms. AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.Silvester said Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.”AIQ has yet to release a statement in relation to the suspension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fb4855daf274e0889194256b065eb6bdf8fab4c/0_162_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dfc9094e344a42b73b7e1e6d826b7e31 1240w","title":"trump russia sanctions election meddling latest","story":"Government officials and oligarchs are among those sanctioned, in US retaliation for alleged election meddling and other actionsThe Trump administration announced new sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 17 top government officials on Friday, in a move that targets Vladimir Putin’s inner circle for “malign activity” including meddling in the 2016 US election and other aggressions.The new economic sanctions represent the most forceful action yet taken by the Trump administration against Putin’s circle. “The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites,” said the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. “Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government’s destabilizing activities.”Mnuchin cited Russian aggression in Crimea and Moscow’s support of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in the bloody civil war in Syria as well as “attempting to subvert western democracies, and malicious cyber activities” as reasons for the sanctions.Among the targeted Russians are Kirill Shamalov, who has grown massively wealthy since marrying Putin’s daughter in 2013.A dozen Russian companies owned by the oligarchs were also targeted, including Rosoboroneksport, a state a state-owned arms-dealing company with ties to the Syrian government, the treasury department said. A business magnate who has managed to survive decades of turbulence in Russia, emerging from the aluminium wars of the 1990s as one of the country’s richest men and marrying into “the family” of Russia’s first president, Boris Yeltsin. He has sought to make himself indispensable to Putin.\u0026nbspThe son of one of Putin’s business associates in a dacha development outside St Petersburg, he was put on the fast track as a young businessman after reportedly marrying Putin’s daughter, Katerina Tikhonova.A former Soviet diplomat and now chairman of the management board of the state-owned VTB bank. The bank has received billions in state support and has made large loans to companies run by the state.Chairman of the management committee of the state-owned energy company Gazprom, he was a former subordinate of Vladimir Putin in the St Petersburg city government in the 1990s.Senior Trump administration officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort by the US to push back Putin’s government, emphasizing that since Trump took office last year, the US has punished 189 Russian-related people and entities with sanctions.Trump has been under pressure from Congress to respond more forcefully to Russian aggression in the US. In recent weeks his administration has rolled out a series of actions including several economic and diplomatic steps to increase pressure on Putin and those in his circle.“Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,” Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday.Still, he has pointedly continued to avoid directly criticizing Putin himself, and recently invited the Russian leader to meet with him, possibly at the White House. Rather than punishing Russia for one specific action, the new sanctions are in response to “the totality of the Russian government’s ongoing and increasingly brazen pattern” of bad behavior, said the officials, who were not authorized to comment by name and briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of Russia’s upper house of parliament, said the sanctions were baseless and unfriendly, Interfax news agency reported. Russia’s trade minister said state companies targeted in the new measures would be given additional government support.But Rosoboronexport said the sanctions against it were designed to squeeze Russia out of the global arms market. “This is unfair competition in its purest form,” a spokeswoman told Reuters. Many of the targets are iniduals and businesses associated with Russia’s energy sector, including those affiliated with state-owned Gazprom. Officials said the goal was to show that those who have benefited financially from the Russian president’s position of power are fair game for US punishments, noting that many of those being sanctioned are closely tied to Putin himself.Also targeted is aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a figure in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling, due to his ties to Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Deripaska has been targeted with US sanctions previously, but officials said those being announced on Friday were more comprehensive.Many of the Russian oligarchs and politicians and affiliated businesses had already been identified by the treasury and state department as potential targets on a list that was compiled and published in January.Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona who has been critical of Trump’s posture on Russia, applauded the new wave of economic sanctions. “Today’s sanctions send a clear message to Putin and his cronies that there will be a high price to pay for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria, and its attempts to undermine Western democracies, including our own,” McCain said in a statement. The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in US jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them. But the administration said it would give guidance to Americans who may currently have business with them about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The Trump administration used a variety of legal mechanisms to implement the sanctions, including the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. Known as CAATSA, the law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 2017 and signed by Trump despite some objections. The law aims to punish Russia for interfering in the US election as well as actions intended to subvert democracy in Europe. The law also authorizes the president to impose sanctions on Iran for destabilizing activity in the Middle East and North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Last month, the US targeted 19 Russians and five other entities with sanctions in the first use of the law. The administration has also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian consulates in response to Russian behavior, including the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that has been blamed on Moscow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8349de50911879e953bcfc317ec600e501631a3/0_236_3747_2248/master/3747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b8a522a4fb77c8d39ecf3fb8a9b6ade5 1240w","title":"trump threatens extra 100bn of tariffs on chinese imports","story":"Dow closes down 572 points as Beijing says it will fight back against new Trump proposalsThe war of words between the Trump administration and China over trade has escalated after Beijing threatened to fight back “at any cost” against new US proposals for an additional $100bn (£71bn) in tariffs.Chinese officials said on Friday they would “definitely fight back firmly” should the US persist in using “protectionism”, in a warning issued hours after President Trump unexpectedly suggested imposing extra trade tariffs on goods shipped from China to the US – on top of the $50bn worth of tariffs announced last month.On Saturday, China’s state media warned that US protectionism would end in defeat and that the only option now was to hit America so hard it would “remember the pain”. “If the US says that it will pay any price, it must be firmly attacked,” China’s official Xinhua news agency said. Trump also hit out at the World Trade Organisation as he responded to China opening a challenge against the tariff plans at the WTO. Trump tweeted that China gets “tremendous perks and advantages” at the World Trade Organisation because it is considered a developing nation. “Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to US,” he said.Speaking to reporters at the White House, press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed concerns about a possible trade war.“The United States is responding to Chinese actions that have gone on for decades,” she said. “The Chinese have engaged in unfair and illegal trade practices for many years and this is simply a response to that.”Sanders also brushed off concerns about the falling stock market, insisting “the actions of the president have strengthen our economy” and pointing to his legislation to lower taxes. Late on Thursday, Trump instructed the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the agency responsible for developing and recommending trade policy, to consider imposing an extra $100bn of import tariffs on Chinese goods arriving in the US. They would come on top of $50bn that have already been announced.Although certain sectors would be affected, the aggregate impact for the country as a whole would be small. About a fifth of the goods on the $50bn list, which ranges from televisions to guns and ammunition, have minimal trade values. Meanwhile, more important goods such as mobile phones and toys were omitted from the list.Both countries have so far shown no inclination of backing down, with each ratcheting up the pressure on the other to respond. After the US unveiled details of its initial $50bn of tariffs, China responded by saying it would impose levies worth the same amount, albeit covering fewer goods of higher value – such as soyabeans and aircraft.Trump labelled the response from Beijing as an “unfair retaliation” at a time when the US has had problems with China allegedly stealing the intellectual property of American companies looking to do business there. But if China did try to match the president’s latest threats for as much as $150bn in tariffs on Chinese goods, it would need to cover more than the total value of US exports to the country. Other options could be for Beijing to halt the purchase of US bonds, or a move to disrupt supply chains essential for US firms, according to analysts. Mark Cliffe of ING Bank said: “The signal is clear: China will not be pushed into concessions, and is willing to accept some economic pain in what Beijing may ultimately see as a political dispute.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb649c82af48ce9258638f92a3b7b390f0fa615/0_0_1920_1080/1920.jpg?w=1280\u0026amp;h=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7cc5f4e88ca2c50fb94338299b9d54","title":"i have dream martin luther king students speech","story":"To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr\u0027s death, the Guardian asked nine students from his former school in Atlanta - Booker T Washington high school - to recite \u0027I Have A Dream\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0098ac6e00233ddfa3607e04b580c2d33043f196/0_0_6000_3376/6000.jpg?w=1280\u0026amp;h=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e758da6a56b09d20e2582877de240577","title":"you have the power to change america parkland students interview bernie sanders video","story":"Rebecca Schneid and Dara Rosen, two student journalists from the Florida high school where 17 people were shot dead, interview the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and ask him whether he thinks Donald Trump has the courage to take on the NRA.Students from the the Eagle Eye, Stoneman Douglas high school’s newspaper, are guest-editing the Guardian\u0027s US site before a protest against gun violence on Saturday\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b48773a735ee898460862f87b2287ffe501ac1c/0_48_3072_1728/3072.jpg?w=1280\u0026amp;h=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ded5a0fd19f162e74b29e01c70b6c4c1","title":"why is the nra so powerful video","story":"The National Rifle Association (NRA) is famous for its influence on American politics.

Lula remained holed up inside the headquarters of a steelworkers union in metropolitan Sao Paulo, surrounded by hundreds of fervent supporters, creating a standoff expected to stretch into the weekend. Talks between Lula’s aides and federal police to arrange his surrender were ongoing on Friday evening, according to two people familiar with the matter. One of the sources, who requested anonymity, said he would not be taken into custody before Saturday. Workers Party leader Gleisi Hoffmann said Lula would take part in a Saturday morning mass at the union headquarters to commemorate the birthday of his late wife Marisa. Hoffmann denied reports that he was negotiating his surrender. Federal police in Sao Paulo declined to say if they would attempt to forcibly take the former president into custody, a move that could trigger intense clashes with his supporters. The arrest warrant, ordered on Thursday evening by Sergio Moro, who leads Brazil’s mammoth Car Wash investigation, stipulated Lula must hand himself in by 5pm local time to federal police in the southern city of Curitiba, though it is also understood he can hand himself in at the São Paulo branch.Lula’s defence team issued a note saying they had filed a request to the UN human rights committee requesting interim measures to block the arrest warrant, alleging bias and the violation of the right to presumption of innocence.They said Lula’s case had been judged far quicker than any other in the Car Wash investigation.The once wildly popular president leads opinion polls for Brazil’s election in October and maintains the conviction is designed to keep him off the ballot.Lula’s detractors celebrated the decision at the supreme court as a victory against corruption and impunity, while his supporters condemned it as an attack on Brazil’s democracy.The night before the decision, a Brazilian general appeared to threaten the supreme court on Twitter, which shook many in a country that had a military dictatorship for more than 20 years.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1987e7fafa408d9d1f668f4f400040f5f72a0e1a/0_531_4547_2729/master/4547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ca344fb18ef9b1d1ef003a3c5875f602 1240w","title":"canada doctor ivf sperm treatment accusation","story":"DNA suggests Dr Norman Barwin illicitly fathered 11 children after couple find husband’s sperm was not used to conceive their daughterA Canadian fertility doctor is facing accusations of using his own sperm to inseminate 11 of his clients, in a class action lawsuit that claims he did so without their knowledge or consent.The proposed lawsuit against Dr Norman Barwin was first launched in 2016 by an Ottawa family who claimed that the prominent doctor had used his own sperm – rather than that of the family’s father – to conceive their daughter in 1990.In the months following, the lawyers behind the lawsuit said they had heard from more than 150 iniduals with concerns about the doctor’s conduct dating back to the late 1970s. On Thursday the lawyers said that DNA investigations suggest that 11 iniduals whose parents had turned to the doctor for treatment are the biological children of Barwin. Those involved are very distressed, lawyer Peter Cronyn told the Ottawa Citizen. “My heart goes out to all of them. Many have demonstrated tremendous courage and are trying their best. It has been very hard.” The previous statement of claim is currently being amended to include the new allegations, he added. The lawsuit has yet to be certified as a class action. The lawsuit will also include the concerns of another 51 people whose DNA bore no resemblance to the iniduals they had believed to be their fathers. In 16 of these cases, the DNA did not match that of the male parent, while another 35 iniduals – all of which had used anonymous donors – were found to have DNA that did not match that of the intended donor. In these cases, the identity of the biological fathers remains unknown. When contacted by the Guardian, Barwin’s lawyer declined to comment. None of the allegations against Barwin have been tested in court.The initial statement of claim stemmed from the experience of Davina and Daniel Dixon, who turned to Barwin for help conceiving in 1989. Their daughter Rebecca was born soon after.“I remember just this wave of shock going through my body,” the daughter, Rebecca, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at the time. “It’s not something that you ever would imagine.” DNA tests later compared her with another woman who – after an ancestry website linked her to one of the doctor’s relatives – said she had been told by Barwin that he was her biological father. The test suggested that the two were “half sisters by way of the same biological father”, according to court documents. The case has made waves in Ottawa, where Barwin was a high-profile doctor who in 1997 was awarded one of the country’s top honors in recognition of the profound impact his work had had on women’s reproductive health. He stopped practicing in 2014, one year after his license was suspended for two months after he admitted inseminating four women with the wrong sperm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7957f3b050ab27205fed350abce06533f30e11e/1067_1276_2451_1470/master/2451.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dd4bbd7975faccbb85a860232868bd31 1240w","title":"former postman found with 400kg of undelivered mail in italy","story":"Man who quit his job in Turin in 2017 says he didn’t deliver any mail for three years because his salary was too lowA former Italian postman is facing charges after police found 400kg of undelivered mail stashed in his home in the northern city of Turin.Police said the 33-year-old, who has not been named, told officers he did not deliver any mail for three years because his salary was too low. He quit the job in 2017.The stash was discovered after the man was stopped during a routine road check, Turin police said in a statement.

The renewed violence came despite a call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres for Israel to exercise “extreme caution”. His appeal was echoed by the UN human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell who said unjustified recourse to live fire could amount to wilful killing of civilians – a breach of the fourth Geneva convention.Figures for the dead and injured were supplied by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza and a website associated with the group. The most seriously injured had reportedly been shot in the head or upper body. Another Palestinian who had been injured in last week’s protests also died on Friday from his wounds.On Saturday morning, the health ministry in Gaza said a Palestinian journalist shot by Israeli forces had died. Yasser Murtaja, a photographer with the Gaza-based Ain Media agency, was hit during clashes Friday. Another man, 20-year-old Hamza Abdel Aal, has also died after being shot, the ministry said, taking the death toll in Friday’s clashes to nine. The deaths came as thousands of protesters streamed towards a series of protest camps along the border for a demonstration calling for Palestinian refugees’ right of return.Under the cover of smoke from burning tyres, dozens of protesters approached the fence in one area, despite warnings by the Israeli military that those who did so risked their lives. Justifying its response, the Israeli military said: “Several attempts have been made to damage and cross the security fence under the cover of the smokescreen created by the burning tyres that the rioters ignited.”Later on Friday, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, visited the Khuza’a camp, receiving a hero’s welcome. Sinwar told the crowd that the world should “wait for our great move, when we breach the borders and pray at al-Aqsa”, referring to the mosque in Jerusalem which is the third holiest site in Islam.His address appeared to be the first time a Hamas leader specifically threatened to break through the border, something Israel has said it would not allow at any price.Among those wounded was Mohammed Ashour, 20, who was shot in the right arm. “We came here because we want dignity,” he told reporters from his stretcher before paramedics carried him to an ambulance.Fresh violence had been widely anticipated after the protests on 30 March, when thousands of Gaza residents participated in the demonstrations, many gathering in five tented encampments that had been set up from north to south along the narrow coastal strip’s border with Israel. According to reports in the Israeli media, the Israel Defence Forces had been anticipating that as many as 50,000 demonstrators could participate on Friday, with the rules of engagement allowing live fire to be used against anyone who approached the border fence.A Guardian reporter at the demonstrations, however, suggested a far lower turnout than last week, when about 30,000 people demonstrated. Among those who turned up was Ali Bakroun, 19. “I came here with my friends to fly the kite we made this week,” he said. “I wrote our names on it. We got close to the fence to throw stones but we stayed in a low place so we would be under cover. I’m not afraid to be shot or killed because our land deserves our lives.”In a statement, the Israeli military underlined its determination to prevent any protesters approaching close to the fence. “The IDF will not allow any breach of the security infrastructure and fence, which protects Israeli civilians, and will act against those who are involved in these attacks,” it said.Guterres issued a statement from the UN saying: “I particularly urge Israel to exercise extreme caution with the use of force in order to avoid casualties. Civilians must be able to exercise their right to demonstrate peacefully. I call upon all parties on the ground to avoid confrontation and exercise maximum restraint.” The Gaza Strip’s border with Israel is highly sensitive for both sides. Overseen in places by observation balloons, in other places the border consists of a double fence and an Israeli security road.As tensions mounted on Friday, Israeli forces fired teargas that landed inside the encampment near the large agricultural village of Khuza’a, briefly sending people fleeing.Yehia Abu Daqqa, a 20-year-old student, said he had come to demonstrate and honour those killed in the past. “Yes, there is fear,” he said of the risks of advancing toward the fence. “We are here to tell the occupation that we are not weak.”Friday’s march was the second in what Gaza’s Hamas rulers have said would be a series of several weeks of protests against a decade-old blockade of the territory. Israel has accused Hamas of trying to carry out border attacks under the cover of large protests and said it would prevent a breach of the fence at all costs.A leading Israeli rights group, B’Tselem, issued a rare appeal to Israeli soldiers to refuse “grossly illegal” orders to fire at unarmed protesters.A White House envoy urged Palestinians to stay away from the fence. Jason Greenblatt said the US condemned “leaders and protesters who call for violence or who send protesters including children to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc0af30e55fc9e728bd5ff6ecf45f8df1ef635b/0_22_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6ee4a7ce40cc4146b6de5f496e7353bd 1240w","title":"trump to reportedly meet with evangelical leaders to discuss stormy daniels","story":"Meeting will address concerns on how the midterms will be affected by Trump’s isive style and alleged affairs, according to sourcesEvangelical leaders are planning a meeting with Donald Trump in June following continuing developments in the scandal over his alleged affair with pornographic actor Stormy Daniels, it was reported on Friday.Four anonymous sources told radio network NPR that the meeting was intended to address concerns about how the midterms might be affected both by the president’s isive leadership style and his alleged sex scandals.As well as the claims by Daniels – real name Stephanie Clifford – former Playboy model Karen McDougal has claimed an affair with Trump. The president on Thursday denied knowing about a $130,000 payment his lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to Daniels to buy her silence.When asked why Cohen made the payment, Trump said: “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”The White House did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Early polling suggests Daniels’ claim she had an affair with Trump before he was president has not had a substantial impact on white evangelicals’ attitudes towards Trump.This poll looks exclusively at white evangelicals, omitting an increasingly powerful and erse bloc within the community. Evangelicals are becoming more erse, fueled largely by an increase in young Latino members. This has led to an increasing political ide in the bloc, as these younger, non-white members are more often Democrats or independents. Five months before the election, Trump met privately with nearly a thousand conservatives, predominantly members of the religious right, at a daylong conference in New York. The meeting was intended to brief Trump on their policy positions and also bolster support for Trump among more religious Republicans. The proposed meeting in June would have similar intentions, the sources told NPR. Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition told NPR he does not expect the affair allegations to substantially reduce evangelical support for Trump in the midterms. “If these folks don’t turn out in record numbers in 2018,” Reed said. “It’s gonna be a long night for Republicans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3229ac551f27a109364356df278af32c9200b0/752_757_4911_2946/master/4911.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=80f35c360700f9393bbc15ebc699e6b6 1240w","title":"whats life like for a female easyjet pilot","story":"Marnie Munns, one of very few female captains, is working with young women to change perceptionsThe incident spurred Munns into taking part in easyJet’s own efforts to change perceptions, talking to girls in school and helping to launch an aviation badge for Brownies. Surveys of pilots show most men had set their minds on a flying career by 11, but few women before 16.She has since encountered some other bizarre beliefs – including a debate on ITV with a journalist who claimed that women’s “mood swings and hormones” could make them unsuitable pilots. “It’s a really strange, antiquated question,” says Munns. “In the old days, there was any excuse to stop women doing professional jobs. “If you are not feeling up to doing the job on the day it is our requirement to tell our employer – but the common cold is a bigger threat than anything else. If you have a blocked nose or sinuses, you can’t fly. We can’t work. But no one has ever said a man can’t do it because of man flu.”Munns, whose grandfather was a pilot, chose her path young. “My parents used to travel a lot when we were children and used to say, go and see the pilot and see what they do.”Unable to afford a private pilot licence, Munns went to university and joined the air squadron. Now, she says university tuition fees mean even the £110,000 pilot training costs look more appealing, with a fairly guaranteed job.Munns works a part-time schedule of nine days of flying per month, instead of up to 18. Speaking to other professional women made her realise, she said, “what is brilliant about this job for women. One said, how come you’re still a captain if you’re only part-time? It dawned on me that if I was at this level in the City, I would have to take a step down. Their perception is you can’t manage. ” Pilot career progression to captaincy may also avoid some invisible barriers. “It’s not, you’re one of the gang, let’s have you in. Training captains have files on us, that rigorously mark training criteria. They don’t know you – or probably even know you’re female until you turn up.” The plane also made it back that night, much delayed, picking up British passengers stranded from other cancelled flights, and Munns and crew clocked off at 2am. Isn’t that the kind of issue that might rule out the job for women (or men) with family commitments? “We all had children. We all had to make phone calls. No one ever asks a nurse about their strange lifestyle. The difference is I get paid a good salary to be able to pay for childcare if I need to.” Munns, a mother of two primary school age children, whose husband is also an easyJet pilot, adds: “We’ve got a good support network. But it has happened that we’ve had to arrange babysitting for 4am.” The day of a short-haul pilot is a busy one: Munns reports to base an hour before the flight, gets the paperwork off the computer and briefs the crew. “I make sure they are all fit to fly, what kind of duties they’ve been doing. We’ll discuss any technical issues with the plane. It’s five minutes. Then we get through security, get to the aircraft and start boarding passengers.”The crew will do up to four flights a day, with just a 25-minute turnaround between them. “That’s actually our busiest time. We’re never really on break. In the cruise you might have five minutes to take a breath, but at the same time you’ll be doing the radios, managing the flight, working out what might be happening down route.”There are a lot of myths to dispel, she says. “People say, what’s it like working with all men? Well, actually I don’t. And the traditional view of the pilot, living out of a suitcase – I do night stops very rarely. They’re actually quite nice when I do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1137b8f4f55770f70497392a3d85d18f92b0b865/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0c7295c239bb9df840d7de5c7dec452c 1240w","title":"zimbabwe child labour tobacco farms human rights","story":"Human Rights Watch says children as young as 11 are working on farms and face exposure to toxic chemicalsThe global watchdog Human Rights Watch has urged Zimbabwe to take urgent steps to stem child labour and other rights abuses on the country’s tobacco farms.In a report titled “Bitter Harvest”, the HRW revealed on Friday that children as young as 11 were working on tobacco farms, often in hazardous conditions, to earn school fees or supplement the family income.Workers were exposed to nicotine and toxic pesticides and suffer symptoms consistent with poisoning such as nausea and vomiting, it said.“Zimbabwe’s government needs to take urgent steps to protect tobacco workers,” said Margaret Wurth, co-author of the Human Rights Watch report.Of the 125 people interviewed, one 12-year-old girl described how she fell ill after handling an unnamed pesticide. “We carry the knapsack and start to spray,” the girl, named Mercy, is quoted as saying. “I feel like vomiting because the chemical smells very bad.”A schoolteacher said his pupils sometimes missed class as they went to work on the tobacco farms. “From the onset of the tobacco growing season, these children start being absent,” said the teacher, named only as Joseph, from the northern Mashonaland West province. “You find out of 63 days of the term, a child is coming 15 to 24 days only,” he said.Seasonal workers on some large-scale farms said they were pushed to work excessive hours without overtime and forced to go weeks or months without pay.Tobacco is the largest foreign currency earner after gold. Last year the country realised $900m from tobacco exports, mainly to China and Indonesia, according to the tobacco industry’s marketing board.President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took charge after the long-time ruler Robert Mugabe was forced to step down, has pledged to prioritise agriculture as he looks to revive Zimbabwe’s moribund economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f87529f134789b5c70d05ea460612fefef27400/203_776_858_515/master/858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1c0103dc9612bed8d34f8c1de19c9a67 1240w","title":"canada multiple deaths after truck collides with junior hockey team bus","story":"Hockey club president says ‘there have been multiple fatalities our whole community is in shock’A crash between a transport truck and a bus carrying a junior hockey team in Western Canada left multiple people dead and others seriously injured, Canadian police said late on Friday.The bus was carrying the Humboldt Broncos of the Saskatchewan junior hockey league to the town of Nipawin for a playoff game. It collided with a transport truck.“There have been multiple fatalities our whole community is in shock,” said Kevin Garinger, president of the Humboldt Broncos.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have not released how many people died or were injured in the crash.

One under investigation for suspicious possession of 159 laptops.”Gustaf Kawer, who is part of the Association of Human Rights Lawyers for Papua, told Guardian Australia on Wednesday the students and activists had been detained and taken to nearby facilities of the mobile police (Brimob) and then police headquarters in Jayapura. KNPB said the raids targeted student dormitories and its offices, and were apparently related to unsourced material that suggested there was a pro-independence declaration event scheduled for Thursday.Bimantara had previously told Guardian Australia the raid was based on “valid information that a number of people were planning to hold an illegal event”. “Upon conducting a thorough check of the location where the iniduals were based, the police found a number of vehicles without the proper papers and suspected stolen electronic devices. The police also found firearm ammunitions.”Bimantara said the police followed strict protocols to ensure the detainees were treated with respect and had access to legal representation.The KNPB chairman, Victor Yeimo, said his organisation was not responsible for the unsourced “propaganda” about a proposed event.He suggested the raid – which he claimed involved Indonesian police, Brimob, military and intelligence agencies – was to shift attention from armed clashes near Timika in which at least two people died.Reuters quoted an Indonesian military spokesman, who said one Indonesian soldier and two separatists were killed in a shootout near the Grasberg mine.Bimantara named the soldier as private Vicky Irad Uba Rumpaisum, “shot dead by a criminal separatist group” while on routine patrol.The West Papua National Liberation Army said a 10-year-old boy and one of their members, and dozens of Indonesian security personnel, were killed in the clash. Guardian Australia is unable to verify the claims of either side. Journalists and human rights groups are restricted from visiting.West Papua has been the site of an independence struggle for several decades. Separatist groups have long fought for independence from Indonesia, which they have repeatedly accused of human rights violations including widespread violence, mass arrests, and killings.Indonesia’s annexure of West Papua was formalised in 1969 by a UN-supervised vote, which has been internationally criticised as an undemocratic process, and there have been allegations of Indonesian threats against those chosen to vote.Bimantara told Guardian Australia it was incorrect to say the area was annexed by Indonesia.“The fact is that in 1969 the United Nations reaffirmed Indonesia’s sovereignty over the provinces of Papua and West Papua. These provinces are sovereign parts of Indonesia and never were listed on the UN decolonisation committee. This fact is indisputable and is internationally recognised.”A pro-independence petition signed by 1.8 million West Papuans was smuggled out of the region late last year and delivered to the United Nations by the exiled West Papuan leader Benny Wenda but it was dismissed by the decolonisation committee, which said Papua was outside its mandate.An activist who was arrested for his role in the petition, Yanto Awerkion, was released last month after 15 months in prison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ec7a6d8c0647b8c04f30952507487b6485b651/0_0_6000_3375/6000.jpg?w=1280\u0026amp;h=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34f17ee53a92931414ae7181afa6a98e","title":"jacinda ardern answers questions from guardian readers video video","story":"When we recently interviewed the New Zealand prime minister in Auckland, we took with us some questions from our readers.

It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing. Anyone prepared to take a bit more risk can opt for a stocks and shares Lifetime Isa. If the stock market goes up, this could provide better returns than a simple cash Lifetime Isa, but you can lose money too. Stocks and shares Lifetime Isas are better suited to longer-term investments, of at least 5 years, so that any dips in the market are balanced out.Whichever you choose, you will have to plan a little in advance – you’ll need to have an account for a year before you can use it to buy a home.Got all that? If so, take the quiz to see if you understand Lisas.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily. OneFamily does not provide financial advice.
