Although his cautionary Americana fables didn’t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn’t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). “He’s obviously well-known as an entertainer,” said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, “but he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.”Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers’ images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as Ray Charles and Dolly Parton, to documenting the natural beauty of America’s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, proudly uploaded to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around.Armed with a 35mm Brownie Hawkeye, Rogers enjoyed taking long walks on the look-out for unique trees. The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. “I only worked an hour a day,” Rogers said of life on the road in 2014. “That meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.”In that interview, with Sports \u0026amp Entertainment Nashville, he added: “So we’d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they’d say, ‘No, I’ve lived here 30 year and there’s nothing.’ And then you’d turn round the corner and you’d find Niagara Falls.”Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed American photographers, from Yousuf Karsh to John Sexton. “Karsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,” said Rogers. “When you see them totally relaxed, that’s when you shoot. John taught me the importance of really loving what you photograph.”Working under these giants of photography, Rogers reached another level. His equipment grew more sophisticated, too. He moved from a Linhof Master Technika 4x5-inch to larger-format cameras capable of producing more arresting 8x10 negatives. The Thumb, one of his most striking shots, captures a digit-like mountaintop in bold black and white. With the moon hovering low in the sky and the stark rock outlines, it resembles a still from a science-fiction movie, lit with dark mystique. Like many of Rogers’s environmental photographs, it has real depth, accentuating the shadows. It’s as if he was suggesting that America, even at its most beautiful, had something sinister lurking in the darkness. You could say the same about many of his songs, particularly Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town.His celebrity portraits are particularly vivid. In 1987, Rogers published Your Friends and Mine, full of portraits of superstars from Elizabeth Taylor to Michael Jackson. He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda.That said, Rogers’s shot of Michael Jackson awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist’s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson’s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.One of Rogers’s biggest lessons came from the Canadian portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.“He came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,” Rogers told the Associated Press. “George said to me, ‘I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!’ He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It’s honestly such a great trick.”Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.Last June, Rogers posted one of his photos to Instagram, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It’s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0230f8dca10fe367d8be01b2600b05250067ea0/1503_153_5271_3163/master/5271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd5e498e6a92dfd91f053bdd03af0e7","title":"hard partying yba sarah lucas i was pretty wild honey pie","story":"As the shamelessly bawdy artist thunders towards her 60s, she talks about knobby guys, life in metal-detecting country – and coping with all her hair falling out last yearThere are three people in the foyer of the gallery grappling with a very large crate, easily two metres tall. “What’s in that?” I ask, edging around them. “It’s empty,” says the woman who seems to be in charge. “But it contained a sculpture called Elf Warrior. We’ve just set it up.” I ask why an elf would need such a big crate. “Because of its knob,” she says. “It’s huge.”Upstairs in the gallery a little later, Sarah Lucas introduces me to Elf Warrior, a bronze arrangement of loose limbs curling around the base of one very long and upright member. “This is kind of a portrait of a friend of mine,” says the artist, who is taking me on a tour of Honey Pie, her latest show, which was about to open at Sadie Coles HQ in London before the coronavirus crisis closed the gallery. “He’s called Olivier, which means Elf Warrior.”Not far away is Sugar, a cluster of breasts bound tightly together above two loosely dangling, pink-stockinged legs. The work is largely created from a sculptural material Lucas has very much made her own: stuffed tights. “Sugar seems to be a big favourite,” says the artist fondly. “She’s kind of like a bouquet of flowers. She’s pinkish so she’s sweet but she doesn’t look overly girly. Her nipples are tights stuffed with wool.”Lucas points cheerily to another “knobby guy”, currently having an undercoat dabbed onto the giant protrusion emanating from what may be his loins. “That guy’s called Dick ’Ead,” she says proudly, as if introducing her best pal. “He’s going to go on that chair over there. He’s concrete. He’s going to be painted a dark red.” She picks up a colour palette and shows me the exact shade.Honey Pie is the new chapter in Lucas’s Bunny series, originally conceived in the 1990s. The first sculptures in Bunny, largely made of found objects and stuffed tights, resembled female nudes reclining. They looked vulnerable and abandoned, as if they had collapsed into their chairs, or been dropped from a great height. In Honey Pie, however, the figures are more playful and colourful, almost cartoonish in their contortions – and they have seriously upgraded their wardrobes, particularly their shoes, which range from four-inch heels to platform trainers.“They are definitely more exuberant,” says Lucas, as we move to Sadie Coles’s office to chat. “Bringing in colour is the new frontier for me. It’s just something I fancied doing. And I don’t know anything about fashion shoes. I just go online and put in high heels or something.” She points to a pair of nude shoes on a blue-stockinged figure perched on a chair. “Those are kind of Louboutins, or rather they’re Chinese knock-offs.”And the tights, will any old pair do? “It can be any tights,” she says. “It’s been a lot of tights. But actually in this show, funnily enough, I got all the tights from Mexico. They’re a brand called Dorian Gray, which is quite funny. Weirdly enough, you use a material because it’s any material you can get anywhere. Then you realise some are better than others. Mexicans are quite robust. You can see it in their artworks – you could call it heavy-handedness. But there’s an incredible strength in all Mexican things. This also applies to their tights. They’re stronger. I use much stronger wire now, too, which can defy gravity more.”Lucas grew up in Holloway, London, the daughter of a milkman father and a mother who worked as a cleaner and a gardener. She has been called the wildest of the YBAs. Is that true? “I was pretty wild, but I wouldn’t say I was the wildest,” she says, suggesting that title actually belongs to her old friend Damien Hirst. “I was the next contender, probably, yeah.” She gives an infectious croaky laugh that speaks of late nights and roll-ups.Her prevailing subject is the body. In 2015, Lucas represented Britain in the Venice Biennale. The pavilion was painted a yolky yellow, a nod to her obsession with eggs and their prevalence in early works, such as Two Fried Eggs and a Kebab. Within sat two large-scale sculptures called Maradona, one boasting a three-metre penis. Alongside these were casts of women’s bottom halves sagging into furniture. “A lot of people would have preferred it if I had not put cigarettes in their orifices,” she says. “But you know, I tried to make it fairly classic and at the same time completely new. Sarah Lucas, right? So the cigarettes had to be in there and I don’t find it offensive.”She mentions she went out for lunch earlier today and the chat around the table had drifted back to the launch party for that Venice show. “I don’t remember a fucking thing about that party. I remember arriving and I remember leaving and getting the vaporetti home. But I don’t remember anything in between. I probably had considerable drinks. I think it was just because the whole thing was so overwhelming, right? It was just too much.”At the time she spoke of feeling torn: there she was representing Britain, yet she did not feel particularly representative of the country, nor it of her. Does she still feel that way? “I don’t know. I mean, it’s such a complex thing. These days everywhere’s getting more and more the same. It’s the same with men and women, we’re more the same than we are different. In some ways, nobody loves Britain more than I do, or British humour, or British TV, or British books. I’m much more into British culture than I am anything else.”As a remainer, though, she is no fan of the people currently deciding the country’s fate. “I can’t stand Jacob Rees-Mogg, even to look at him. I would describe it as harking back to a time irrelevant to now.”She looks out of the huge windows, at the blue skies over the London rooftops, and notices a colourful bowl resting on the sill, shaped and painted to resemble an octopus furling its tentacles around itself. “Beautiful,” she says. “That’s a Kris Lemsalu.”Lucas lives in rural Suffolk these days, with her partner, the composer Julian Simmons. Their house, nestling down a country lane, once belonged to Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. “I still have a place in London,” she says, “so I’ve not totally given up urbanity. But quite truly, I am there more and more. To make these works, I got a studio in the town nearby. It’s a really historic town called Framlingham, but we just call it Lingham. It’s got a castle at the top, a beautiful church, a marketplace. Do you ever watch Detectorists? It’s set in that town.” She thinks the TV show does a good job of capturing the spirit and mentality of the townspeople.“I grew up in London and didn’t have any rural connections. It’s been an adventure of its own. It feels really like home, but also kind of a retreat, a haven from the rest of my life – not just London but the travelling and everything else, with getting older especially.”Lucas will be 58 later this year. How does the one-time hard-partying YBA feel about nearing her 60s? “It is a good question, and not having children doesn’t help you mature.” Do you ever wish you had? “No, not really. But a weird thing happened to me in October the year before last. I started losing my hair. I saw a tiny bald patch on my head, then gradually I started losing hair. It’s alopecia. By June last year, it had nearly all fallen out. My eyebrows had gone and everything. I’d resorted to wearing wigs a bit.“When I went to China in October for my next big show, I had a bit of white hair and still no eyebrows. But I remember getting to China, looking in the mirror, and seeing a dark shadow over my head. You can see I’ve got quite a lot of dark hair now, and some white hair, and my eyebrows have come back.”She’s wearing it pinned up today and you’d hardly notice but she’s clearly still reeling from the experience. “It was dreadful, like disintegrating. And you don’t know if it’s going to come back. I had to go very rapidly through biting the bullet. It was a major upheaval and I’m sort of getting over it now. It’s made me feel a bit more accepting of myself as an old person. Until then, I hadn’t quite had to look it in the eye.”When Lucas made her first Bunny, she described it as a “Eureka!” moment. Almost three decades on, that feeling of excitement clearly hasn’t left her. As we move back out into the gallery, she stands among her new additions, the stuffed-tights women and the knobby guys. Her eye is suddenly drawn to the pattern on the grey walls behind, which have a trace of white marbling up their surfaces. “It’s sort of like ejaculation,” says Lucas with a mischievous smile. “But maybe that’s just me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f361682dc2154a09a9c06c47de2698b0fb3115/0_1754_8353_5012/master/8353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f37f86781cfab3b04c821733244676","title":"sacha alexis pazoumian life in earths deepest deep freeze in pictures","story":"It is one of chilliest spots on the planet.

Souhami has written several fine biographies of what Truman Capote once reprehensibly called the “daisy-chain” of “butch-babes” now, in a comprehensive cultural history, she awards lesbians the credit for modernising art, manners and morals in the early 20th century.Like a tabloid headline, her book’s title is intended to provoke, and it depends on a somewhat tenuous analogy: “modernism in art upended 19th-century rules of narrative and form”, so why shouldn’t modernity in life revise the “codes of conduct for sexual exchange”, licensing women to defy men or dispense with them and love each other instead? To paraphrase her slogan a little more modestly, what Souhami shows is that there might have been no modernism if the lesbian bookseller Sylvia Beach had not arranged to publish James Joyce’s Ulysses in Paris when editors in London and New York, fearing prosecution for obscenity, refused to touch it.Beach, who founded the Left Bank bookshop Shakespeare and Company, behaved towards Joyce with a wifely devotion that was lacking in his actual spouse, the rebarbative Nora Barnacle. She happily performed the endless editorial chores he set her, and glorified the labour as her “missionary endeavour’. The moment that wealthier backers became available, Joyce of course forgot about her service to him. The ancient female function of helpmeet was hard to shed. Beach’s shop, installed in a former laundry, was a domestic space, furnished with comfortable chairs and vases of flowers brewing tea or lending books to customers who could not afford to buy them, she officiated as a mother hen.Another of Souhami’s characters dispensed patronage on a grander scale. Bryher – born Annie Winifred Glover, though she reinvented herself by borrowing a new name from one of the Scilly Isles – was the munificent daughter of a shipping magnate. She bankrolled the artistic whims of everyone she knew, paid Freud a small fortune to psychoanalyse her lover Hilda Doolittle, and presented Edith Sitwell with a house. In her saintlier or dottier moments, she played Lady Bountiful to strangers in the street: she bought new dentures for a woman she found toothlessly chomping in a bread queue, and replaced the ill-fitting wellington boots of a woebegone fireman.Throughout her book, Souhami rails at the “old-style masculine domination” that results in war, mass murder and sexual repression. As the jack-booted invaders march into Paris in 1940, trampling what was once “the sapphic centre of the western world”, she calls patriarchy “militaristic, fascistic”. Yet power is not an exclusively male preserve, and it lurks in the relationships between women examined here. The painter and poet Natalie Barney appears as a reckless predator who breaks a sofa when pouncing on a supine seducee the Princesse de Polignac – another heiress, born Winnaretta Singer, whose liberation was bankrolled by her family’s output of sewing machines – brings the skittish Violet Trefusis to heel with a whip.Gertrude Stein and Alice B Toklas act out a paradoxical variant of this power play. Stein was cubistically solid, gruff and glowering, while Toklas, even with her bristly moustache, looked meek and dainty. Alice kept house, cooked, and allowed Gertrude to be a full-time genius, which was hard work because “you have to sit around so much doing nothing”. Yet the apparent weakling in this menage turned out to be the slave-driver, as Ernest Hemingway testified when he overheard Stein beg for mercy as she was tongue-lashed by the partner she called “Pussy”.Stein made up for such grovelling when she announced her artistic status by declaring that “20th-century literature is Gertrude Stein”. Her self-puffery now sounds absurd, and Souhami’s view of her as “the mother and father of modernism” is not much more persuasive. At best, Stein was the fairy godmother of modernism. Like Beach and Barney, she kept a salon where she performed the traditional role of hostess, supervising the camaraderie of the male painters, writers and musicians who attended armed with the inevitable private income, derived in her case from San Francisco streetcars, she amassed an uninsurably valuable collection of paintings by Cézanne, Picasso and Matisse, which she left unframed and sometimes casually stashed in closets.Daunted by Stein’s droning epic The Making of Americans, Souhami has better luck with the avian burbling of her libretto for Virgil Thomson’s all-black opera Four Saints in Three Acts. Here Stein’s verbal tics are subsumed into music, and Souhami writes about the witty, frothy piece with verve. Then, getting overzealous, she claims that Four Saints was more epochal and innovative than Ulysses, if only because Joyce’s novel was still fuddy-duddily “bound within the covers of a book”.Souhami ends with some blithe mimicry of Stein’s echolalia, rejoicing in a Parisian paradise where “lovers of love and refreshment in life still loved, and loved lovers and loved love”. I abbreviate a long alliterating paragraph of hallelujahs: here is Capote’s daisy chain made of words, though the repetitions hardly erase memories of the miserable childhoods and agonising affairs Souhami has chronicled. Love is lovely and even heavenly, but sex, regardless of gender, can be diabolical.• No Modernism Without Lesbians by Diana Souhami is published by Head of Zeus (£25). To order a copy go to bookshop.

At this point, there are no hand sanitiser dispensers so you cannot wash your hands. There are also areas where people touch. You don’t know what germs are being spread as a result.”The company said it plans to conduct body temperature checks on all workers entering the site to check for a fever and has banned handshakes to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. It also agreed to provide extra buses to halve the number of people travelling in each vehicle so that they can be seated at least two metres apart.Work on the HS2 high-speed rail project is continuing for now but a spokesperson said that may have to change.“Over the course of this week and into next, we will be reviewing the majority of works on our construction sites in line with government advice on dealing with Covid-19.”Other major construction projects such as Crossrail and two major hospitals that were delayed after the collapse of Carillion, have set out plans to prevent the spread of coronavirus and will remain open for now.The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said Britain’s construction industry was in an “unenviable position” between safeguarding workers’ health and averting an industry collapse similar to the 2008 financial crisis.Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said: “Our industry does not want to stop working. Until we are told by the government to down tools, we will be doing everything we can to support the safest possible working environment.”The government is understood to be wary about imposing restrictions on the construction industry, which is a major driver for Britain’s economic growth, at a time when the economy risks slipping into recession.The Hinkley Point project alone is expected to generate £200m of value for the south-west’s economy every year by contracting local businesses – almost £4bn over the life of the project.Dan Dobson, a Unite member, said workers on sites across the country feared speaking out or turning their back on a job because they were self-employed and had limited employment rights or protections.“Workers turned up at their sites this morning and expected to be told to go straight home. Instead, they were told it’s business as usual,” he said.“The government needs to close the non-critical sites and extend the wage support scheme to the registered self-employed, and they need to take those actions immediately. Construction workers cannot afford to miss out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca8b52e0b6efcb8c22f0a7436850c3a3452ed807/0_158_6478_3891/master/6478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e1d6dca775293b1d9c4372c4307d29","title":"britain covid 19 head start squandered","story":"The government’s dithering and lack of transparency will cost many thousands of lives• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083c9d5002b89e66f81d380f8683b493e8f63c8d/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fb87c018445f157bee0f6cc2df4e3b","title":"europe views uk coronavirus plan disbelief","story":"Here in Spain, the number of deaths is rising, but I am more worried about my friends and family in Britain and the USYesterday, in the small Spanish country town where I go to fill up my water supply, an ambulance with flashing lights went up the deserted main street. Two municipal police cars followed it slowly, making it look already like a funeral procession. Only three other people were out, and two of them were wearing face masks.When I first saw pictures like this from China and Iran, for some reason, I didn’t take seriously that it would also happen in Spain – my home for the past 25 years. It wasn’t just me who thought this, many politicians and experts were saying the same.How wrong we were. Italy has overtaken China, becoming the country with the greatest number of deaths in the pandemic. Spain took third place from Iran yesterday, and will likely take only three days to move ahead of China. Little surprise, then, that the government has now extended our almost total lockdown to a full month.Ideas of cultural or national superiority are the greatest risk factor of all at a time like this. Nowhere is that a more serious danger right now than in the United Kingdom and the United States – two countries especially prone to such delusions.In fact, watching the UK from a distance has felt like scrambling out of your car at the front of a multiple pile-up on the motorway, only to see other cars smashing into the rear 20 minutes later. Didn’t anyone warn them about what lay ahead? Surely everyone knew. That is what it looks like from mainland Europe – the new centre of the pandemic.If you think that what is happening in southern Europe is a result of corruption, incompetence, lower household income or poor public health systems, then you are fooling yourself. All the signs suggest that the UK and the US are heading in exactly the same direction. Both countries are just a week or so behind.From my remote country house, a long way from my elderly neighbours, I have been viewing the daily briefings by Boris Johnson and his advisers with a mixture of incredulity and occasional admiration. How can they be so sure that their approach of managing and mitigating the flow of the pandemic – hardly used by anyone else – is right?The health experts sound convinced, but Boris Johnson’s air-punching promises about “turning the tide” remind me of King Cnut. There are other recognisable and worrying elements. The UK government’s reaction chimes too easily with Johnson’s “sceptered isle” nationalism and blitz-style nostalgia. It also fits the “wild card” thinking of Dominic Cummings. Donald Trump and his cheerleaders, meanwhile, appear convinced that America’s “greatness” will itself provide a magical coat of protection.Politicians and experts must make hard choices – and they may still be right. I certainly hope so. Yet hubris, in this case, will be paid for in lives.If the rest of the world looks upon the UK’s coronavirus planning with skepticism, that is because it is a clear outlier. A plucky nation boldly going its own way is a perfectly reasonable pitch for Brexit. It does not sound so convincing during a pandemic.Commentators in Spanish newspapers and on the radio are aghast. “They are putting us all in danger,” warned a group of Spanish scientists in eldiario.es. French ministers were talking about a special ban on people from the UK.The British “herd immunity” model (which the government has since pivoted on) was certainly not embraced by countries in Asia, which have been spectacularly successful at stopping the virus so far. They must be looking at Europe and the US with utter bewilderment.Trump calls this a “Chinese” pandemic, but it will probably take more lives in both the US and the UK than in China itself. Yet these two higher income countries, with much smaller populations, had many more months to prepare.Spain failed to implement early widespread testing (and is only just starting), but at least we are 10 days into our month-long lockdown. That terrifying daily leap of a third in the number of deaths will have begun to flatten out before that period ends. The UK, however, has already had more deaths than when Spain (or China) went into quarantine – and it still has not fully locked itself down.Recently, my neighbours in Madrid called me to tell of police vans patrolling the streets, loudspeakers blaring, reminding people to stay indoors. For all the madrileño capacity for resistance (and a three-year siege during the Spanish civil war surely matches the blitz spirit), it is grim. So, too, was that ambulance going up the street.And yet I find myself more worried for family and friends in the UK and the US than for those of us here in Spain. You are just behind us. You, too, may soon overtake Iran and China. When this is all over, we will count the dead and discover which governments did the best job of protecting their people. Ideas of national superiority will have to be buried with them.• Giles Tremlett is a journalist and author based in Madrid"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bba0ca37ad6f0b51fe0d7d9f77932c38b9b9e04e/0_0_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a127d37937e6dc97f7d4ec44cf99772","title":"your coronavirus sabbatical starts now dont let it go to waste","story":"Stuck at home? Here’s how you can use quarantine to redesign your lifeAll over the world those who care about their health are hunkering down at home. In other circumstances, this might be a boon, an unexpected opportunity to chill-out rather than set off for yet another day in the frantically-paced 21st century. But when you are looking at weeks, maybe months of this, you do start to ask: how on earth am I going to fill my time? I have a few ideas …Start by thinking of the range of things you would like to do: from tidying out the junk drawer in your kitchen to repainting your dining chairs to reading À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or starting to write your own novel. Put each idea on a spreadsheet, scoring them one to five by such factors as practicality, seriousness of intent, length of time needed, possibility of completing the task alone and so on. You might have 30 possible projects but once you’ve put them through your filter, about five would be a good total. Goals should be achievable, maybe not easily, but you don’t want to set out for something so gargantuan that failure is inevitable.For while it’s good to come up with self-improving ideas for your coronavirus sabbatical, you need to keep in mind self-compassion too. Don’t beat yourself up over this. It’s not a competition. This is a difficult time for everyone don’t make it any harder.If you are continuing to do your job from home, be up and showered at your usual time don’t stay in pyjamas or work from bed. You want to stay sharp and focused. If your time is your own, you have more flexibility, but most people find that they get much more done if they set themselves a timetable with breaks every 45 minutes or so. It’s also a good idea to shuffle your tasks. After all, you have plenty of time, so you don’t have to finish everything before starting something new.Some projects could entail working with others remotely. Learning a language for example. A friend or tutor might agree to have language lessons with you by phone. You could move your book group online, or you could start a new, smaller one with the specific aim of reading positive, encouraging texts no more Handmaid’s Tale for you.You might even come up with a new business idea. One friend of mine Suzanne Noble has a hit with her Corona Concerts on Facebook, which she started when her London gigs as a blues singer were cancelled.Staying in contact with others is key. As therapist Mark Bailey wrote on welldoing.org, “We are social beings and we need interaction to be psychologically healthy. Facetime and Skype are frankly godsends in these times so use them – not just for work but for friends, acquaintances and family. Focus conversation on other things in life, not just coronavirus!”If you are able to get out of your home and safely go for a walk or run, do just that. But, increasingly, that’s not encouraged. Use YouTube videos for exercise tips or yoga classes haul out your skipping rope, run up your stairs. If you’ve got a standing desk, use that for some of the time.If you can’t move about much, don’t spend too much time in your kitchen or you risk something less dangerous than coronavirus, but unpalatable all the same: packing on the pounds. Drinking lots of alcohol may also seem like a good idea at the outset, but it will soon have the same effect as the food.All the irritating things in your life? Your messy desktop, unfiled documents, ancient bank statements, photos, schoolbooks: this is the time to deep clean your administrative life. Be brutal, go for the clean slate.Your wardrobe too would probably benefit from the sort of critical analysis that large tranches of free time will afford. Follow the time-honoured advice of separate piles: throw out, recycle or charity, mend or clean, keep and wear.Spend some of your time creatively. What better time to get Harriet Griffey’s Write Every Day to kickstart creative writing? Or dare yourself to draw, even if you haven’t since you were 12. Or sew, or knit? Or write poetry?Your might also imagine that this almost unbelievable health crisis is the beginning of something new. A kind of re-set, where we all give ourselves more time to reflect and ponder what life is all about, and how happy we are to actually be alive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96b5ca75c76c48827dea05932bd5be727931904/0_232_6964_4179/master/6964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf8092a83e271289f4b0d4a41d1a0f8","title":"britain benefits rishi sunak claimants austerity","story":"A decade of cuts has ripped apart the safety net. People on decent salaries hit by the Covid-19 fallout are in for a shockMillions of people are about to discover something they didn’t know about British life. There is no longer a safety net. People who have paid tax and national insurance for years and never been near the social security system will be turning to it in their hour of need yet far too late, like trapeze artists falling through the air, they will find that the net beneath them has been lowered dangerously close to the ground and is badly torn.If these people once believed relentlessly misleading tabloid tales of benefit scroungers, they will have a rude awakening. They will find that when Iain Duncan Smith turned the screw on social security in 2012, he was right to warn claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” As if it ever was.Let’s hope that injustice is fixed. But even then, watch the shock as millions fall on the untender mercies of the Department for Work and Pensions, to discover what happened to benefits in the past decade. While never over-generous, by 2010 Labour had greatly lifted living standards for low earners, especially for children: Gordon Brown’s tax credits raised a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. Since 2010, according to new research by Kerris Cooper and John Hills, a professor at the London School of Economics, children have lost a quarter of the support they had chancellor George Osborne and his successors took out a staggering nearly £40bn from benefits. Never “all in this together”, Osborne justified it by raining down abuse on low-paid families. The hypocrisy: as the current editor of the London Evening Standard, he ran Christmas collections for poor families! The Resolution Foundation predicts a third of children falling into poverty by 2023.Some cuts were secretive, uprating benefits by a meaner CPI not RPI inflation rate, a four-year freeze, and axing council tax support. Some made a noise – such as the bedroom tax, costing some families £14 week for a spare room. An early case was a Hartlepool family whose empty room belonged to their recently deceased 10-year-old. Housing benefit for renters was cut brutally. Introducing the two-child limit was exceptionally unjust.Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says people on £50,000 salaries have been anxiously asking him about benefits rates. They’re in for a shock, he says. Unlike the previous tax credit system, universal credit only allows savings of £6,000 (it takes steep deductions from savings up to £16,000). People hoping this is only temporary will be distraught at having to use up their rainy-day funds, often saved for years for a deposit on a home. The foundation is lobbying urgently to have this savings means-test dropped.Hills says a couple with two children will get £266 a week. And take from that £115 – the average amount that housing benefit falls short of rental payments. Many new claimants will run up rent arrears. Expect them to plunge immediately into poverty, miles below the £384 minimum income standard for a family of four, says Hills. Some singles will get a shock too. Under-35s will be living on £73, and only funded for a room in a shared flat, in the cheapest third of rentals in the area. Many who see themselves as middle class will confront the reality of Britain’s nonexistent safety net. It is, says the IFS’s Paul Johnson, “extraordinarily low”. One piece of advice from all these experts I’ve talked to: apply immediately, to limit these delays and debts. “Too many will wait, borrow from family, deny it’s happening to them, feeling the stigma. Apply at once,” says Torsten Bell.These millions discovering DWP brutality at first hand will no longer be deceived by the old poison shaming those on benefits as loafers, frauds and “not people like us”. Benefits offer penury, not a life of Riley. Rishi Sunak has been lavishly praised, not least for his empathic language: “We will be judged by our capacity for compassion”.

The words hard and daunting crop up frequently as she describes her journey from a Midlands comprehensive, then sixth-form college, to one of the most elite universities in the world.Oxford has felt “one step removed from me”, she explains. “A friend of a friend had been, but I didn’t have any family reference points so it felt very tough.”Now, about to sit her English finals, Minogue is a testament to one Oxford college’s stunning success in the rebalancing of state and private school Oxbridge entry, one of the most hotly contested issues in public education.More significantly, the majority of those offers come from non-selective state schools and include a higher percentage of disadvantaged pupils, those from BAME backgrounds and from areas with low progression to higher education than the rest of the university. So how have they pulled it off, and why can’t others?According to Mansfield’s new principal, Helen Mountfield, they could. Mountfield is a barrister and former south London comprehensive schoolgirl – although from a middle-class professional family – who made it to one of the most exclusive colleges, Magdalen, in the 1980s.She believes Mansfield’s success, whereby the college has moved steadily up the Oxford Norrington table from bottom in 2007 to fifth this year, is down to its longstanding outreach work, its approach of putting each applicant’s achievements in context and the college’s “authentic” culture.“My answer to the social engineering point is that we don’t believe we are taking less clever people to make up for disadvantage. We are looking for the cleverest people from a pool where everyone is clever. We want the people who will walk out of the door as the finished article, not those who will walk in the door as the finished article,” she says.The college employs two expert access officers and makes a determined effort to present itself as a place that is open the website’s headline reads: “Open, Friendly, Welcoming. Mansfield has the highest state sector intake of Oxford”.“Applicants don’t have to worry about being in a cultural minority here, or whether they would fit in,” says Mountfield. “There isn’t really a cultural minority here. People come from all over and with different backgrounds.”The college also takes a painstaking approach to analysis of contextual data such as progression rates to university and levels of disadvantage in different parts of the country, GCSE and A-level results and free school meals (FSM) eligibility of each applicant’s school and whether they are care leavers.Perhaps the most contentious element of the Oxbridge admissions is the interview. A recent report from the Sutton Trust showed that six private schools and two state sixth-forms accounted for more Oxbridge offers than 3,000 other state schools and credited the availability of expert advice and preparation for that success.Mansfield College’s senior admissions tutor, Lucinda Rumsey, recounts one applicant explaining that the only interview she had experienced before coming to Mansfield was at Greggs bakery. She got in and graduated with a 2:1. Rumsey believes the interview process is a powerful tool for equalising access. “The important thing for selection is good pre-interview information, prior qualifications and a reference from a teacher who knows the student well and has seen them develop. Then we are trying to work out if candidates have aptitude for a particular subject and will thrive at it.“The interview helps us to do some nuanced work around that. Tutors as subject specialists are in a good position to assess potential. Almost all the applicants we get are well-qualified, and we have to make fine distinctions.“If candidates start out very well prepared by their school for interview, we try to see past that. If they have come from a school that rarely sends applicants to Oxford and have had no preparation, we want to see past that as well.“Some candidates can be inflexible in their thinking if we take them off their comfortable ground. Interviews aren’t only about getting a right answer but engaging with what is asked and thinking through a problem that it is difficult and unfamiliar.”The colleges’ access officer, Sara Harb, whose family moved to the UK from Jordan when she was five, recently graduated with a first in history after coming to Mansfield from an inner London comprehensive.“There were people at my school saying, ‘people from this school don’t go to Oxford’ but as soon as I got here, I realised everyone seemed friendly and normal and not geniuses or very posh,” she explains.“People from less well-performing schools often have to work really hard to get the grades and my school didn’t have the right interview prep but the tutors made me feel settled. I felt I was being challenged in an academic and friendly way rather than being set up to get caught out.”“In these Covid-19 times we see the starkly different home circumstances of students. We have students who are alienated from families, students who have been carers, share rooms with siblings, don’t have a desk or wifi at home,” she adds.“For us the next step is giving students access to equal chances after they leave, social capital as well as educational capital, so networks, grants for internships.”Dan Hall, a third-year undergraduate in PPE from a state school in Manchester, agrees that different education backgrounds also show up after admission.“For me it was ‘wow I am here, got to make the most of the experience’ rather than focus on career stuff. It is only later on that you realise you are behind the curve because they have been on a different path from the start.”Rumsey says there is a lot more pride in the state school access issue across the university, with conversations focusing more on the impact of privilege than disadvantage.“There has been a presumption in the past that the latter group are riskier. But once you have made this shift, and seen the impact, you know that isn’t true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7367cb75e1db4941a372e03cdabf351513bd17e5/0_223_6720_4035/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2607fffb7253372ce5dead9200e40d1","title":"testing times for students food banks open at universities","story":"With maintenance loans now barely covering rent, many students are going hungryGemma Peacock has little money left over after she has paid her rent. She worked all summer to save up funds to supplement her university maintenance loan, but near the end of term she has a battle to make ends meet.“It can be stressful,” says Peacock, a 20-year-old psychology student at Leeds Beckett University. “If I’m struggling I will walk every day instead of paying for the bus, and some days I have to walk for over two hours just to get to and from uni. I can afford basic food with my loan, but a lot of the time, I’m not eating a balanced diet.”That’s why Peacock turned to the food bank that Leeds Beckett students’ union (LBSU) has set up to help struggling students. It has allowed her to stock up on basics like pasta and beans, freeing up more cash for fresh food.Tucked away discreetly next door to the student bar, the food bank is a small shop space adorned with fairy lights and shelves stacked with pasta, rice, tins of soup, chocolate biscuits and tampons. To the side are crates of fresh vegetables.Dotted around the shop are signs reading, poignantly, “Give or take”. The initiative is about encouraging students to donate, as much as it is about helping those in need, say the volunteers.With the coronavirus outbreak making students even more financially vulnerable, the service has become more important than ever, and the student union has increased the opening hours and organised to drop food packages at students’ homes to ensure all are provided for, even if they’re self-isolating. One of the main challenges is giving people the confidence to use it. “A lot of people are quite embarrassed to say they need help,” says Fozia Iqbal, one of the students who helps to run the service.Some do come in regularly, while for others it is a stop-gap. “One girl who came in told me that she needed something because she was getting paid tomorrow, and she needed to eat tonight. I thought, ‘Without this she probably would have gone hungry’.”Iqbal herself has only about £100 left each term after paying rent. Last year she juggled three part-time jobs while studying for her master’s in architecture, relying on the student union’s pay-as-you-feel soup kitchen on the run-up to payday.Jake Butler, a student finance expert from Save the Student, a student money advice site, says its latest accommodation survey shows the average maintenance loan now doesn’t cover the average student rent.According to the survey, published in February, the average student rent is now £126 a week (£6,552 a year), and £162 in London (£8,400 a year). The survey polled 2,168 students in December 2019 and January 2020.Students receive on average £540 a month in their maintenance loans, according to Save the Student’s calculations. With the average student rent working out at £547.82 a month, many students have little or no money left for food and other essentials.Jess Carrier, the welfare and community officer at LBSU, says the system doesn’t work for many students: “Even though it is supposedly means-tested, not everyone is supported by their family.”Peacock says: “My mum works seven days a week, so it’s not really fair of me to ask her because she’s struggling herself anyway. I don’t want to take her money off her.”The fact that students are turning to food banks at university is worrying, says Butler. “Unless the government does something about the maintenance loan, we could see university food banks opening up in more locations. The system is long overdue for reform.”Leeds Beckett isn’t the only university to start a food bank. Last year the University of Kent launched Stuff – a student food bank and freecycle scheme offering food and recycled homeware. Kent is planning to keep the service running throughout the coronavirus crisis.At Northumbria University, the students’ union has had to close its food bank service supplying food parcels, but has redirected all provisions to help self-isolating students.Staffordshire University student union has been running its Food Hub since 2014. In the last academic year the service was accessed 183 times, and numbers are set to increase in 2019-20, with more than 100 students having used the Food Hub so far. Like LBSU, they’re stocking up on provisions from wholesalers at the moment to ensure they have enough to keep students going.The students’ union recognises that even while avoiding the term “food bank” students still face stigma, and has started using food vouchers that allow students to get food at retail outlets on site.Connor Bayliss, president of Staffordshire University students’ union, says: “Sixty-five per cent of our students are local, many are mature or commute, and a high percentage of them are juggling caring or parental responsibilities and part-time work with their studies. Some students, such as those with children, are entitled to universal credit, and some have been “significantly affected” by the problems of its introduction, he says.Stoke-on-Trent, where it is based, is ranked as the 14th most deprived local authority area in England. “In some cases, support can mean providing enough food for their families.”Eve Crossan Jory, vice-president for welfare of the National Union of Students, says she is “appalled but unsurprised” at the increase in food banks. “Student maintenance funding is woefully inadequate, while rents are spiralling out of control. In one of the wealthiest societies, the fact that students and non-students alike need to access food banks is shameful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ed715b367c65d671d54e55a3cebff24ca0314f/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a66e44a670c7c7ae76f1a620e1d64935","title":"coronavirus pandemic leading to huge drop in air pollution","story":"‘Largest scale experiment ever’ shows what is possible as satellite images reveal marked fall in global nitrogen dioxide levelsThe coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows.One expert said the sudden shift represented the “largest scale experiment ever” in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.Readings from ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year.Nitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma.While not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world’s carbon emissions and that drive global heating.Paul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. “We are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,” he said. “Are we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”Monks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.The World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots.The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.“What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8af7e931cea74c653928d7d656b13a798c0a589/0_53_5750_3452/master/5750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab355c1c9cc9e2d03b74917a5df6d187","title":"electric cars produce less co2 than petrol vehicles study confirms","story":"Finding will come as boost to governments seeking to move to net zero carbon emissionsElectric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe – contrary to the claims of some detractors, who have alleged that the CO2 emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits.The finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.In the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country.Across the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.That has made some iniduals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, produced a decisive yes.Scientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO2 saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.Heat pumps use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today.“The idea that electric vehicles or heat pumps could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”Jean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”Among the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”.Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”But he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.“Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the necessary rapid rollout of electric cars and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45d596640e52d1550f6bbcdef921663d9e352a2/0_548_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc44b13a3e27ddcfe3e70d0d0af8192","title":"meat prices could rise as covid 19 adds pressure to vulnerable supply chain coronavirus","story":"Possible slaughterhouse shutdowns and staffing issues put pressure on ‘vulnerable’ supply chains, as campaigners call for restriction of live exportsCampaigners have called for the suspension of all live animal shipments out of Europe, and a restriction to the shortest possible journeys within Europe, over welfare and animal diseases concerns – as meat supply chains face potentially debilitating strain. Last week queues of up to 60km (37 miles) formed at the PolishGerman border on Wednesday after Poland announced that it was shutting to foreigners. Although the closure was supposed to apply solely to people, cargo experienced a knock-on effect, with some trucks reportedly taking as long as 18 hours to get through border controls. More queues formed at the BulgarianTurkish border. Sabine Fisher of German animal welfare group Animal Angels said: “One driver told us that it had taken him three hours to travel 300 metres. There were trucks of sheep, bulls, cows. I’ve never seen a queue like it.”Under EU regulations no animal should travel for more than eight hours without being rested. Campaigners have now sent a letter to the EU commission calling for the immediate suspension of live animal transport to non-EU countries, and of all journeys over eight hours within the EU, as such journeys also raise concerns over disease transmission.“Farm animals are either a source or messenger of zoonotic diseases,” said Gabriel Paun of Animals International “Suspending live export and trading meat instead will ensure both food security and public health. With the current border crisis, the EU commission breaks its own transport regulations by deliberately putting animals through planned and unnecessary suffering. On top of that they expose all the animal handlers, truck drivers and others to risk.”The border crisis has added to growing anxiety about the meat supply chain. Any shutdown of slaughterhouses could lead to supply restrictions, price rises and problems for farmers, say experts.“The slaughterhouse system is extremely vulnerable because although there is an increasing amount of automation, they are still largely dependent on human labour,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst with IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence. “If someone is ill on the line, then does the whole line have to self-isolate and for how long? The plant will have to be shut down and deep cleaned. And then if there are not enough inspectors, or if staff just don’t come in, they will also have to shut down.”If there are no vets or inspectors available, the plant cannot operate. And the stringent hygiene requirements mean that a shortage of gloves and other sanitation equipment of the type currently needed by medical staff could mean shutdown.Slaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants. In the US, according to the Animal Welfare Institute, the number of slaughterhouses fell from nearly 8,000 in 1970 to just under 3,000 in 2018. And in the UK, according to the Sustainable Food Trust, the number of red meat abattoirs has fallen from about 1,900 in 1971 to 249 in 2018.When a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called “historically significant”. The margins for beef carcasses doubled, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care.On top of this the meat processing industry has long struggled to attract workers. “Finding workers for slaughterhouses has been a global problem,” said Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira. “But we’ve got a particular problem now because if you are earning £13 an hour, are you going to be coming into work if you’re at risk? And these workers are not immediately replaceable you need a week’s training, shadowing someone else on the line.”There were reports early in the week that Danish Crown, one of Europe’s largest pork producers, had been concerned about the possible closure of one of its plants. However, a spokesperson explained that although many of the workers at the Danish plant commute regularly from Poland, they are confident production will continue at normal levels.Karsten Maier of the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union said that it was hard to have a complete overview of the situation at present, but that they were closely monitoring events.In the UK, David Lindars of the British Meat Processors Association told the : “We have been in regular contact with the Food Standards Authority, and have come up with a robust plan and very strong contingency plans for the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165628e1275bc0590053dbdd0271e39ff195474f/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d03014ec7f1060e2ad1a185848bcbc24","title":"fright of her life gold coast woman finds five metre python on her doorstep","story":"Queensland snake catcher says 80kg albino Burmese python found in Oxenford is the largest he has come across in 27 years As a seasoned snake catcher, Tony Harrison is used to the people the claiming there is a five-metre snake on their doorstep. But for the first time on Monday, the caller wasn’t exaggerating.“This was the largest snake I have come across in 27 years,” Harrison said. “The poor old lady who opened the front door to see it there got the fright of her life”The giant albino Burmese python was found in the Gold Coast suburb of Oxenford.With the snake weighing more than 80kg, Harrison said it was lucky for him the reptile was good-tempered.“Burmese pythons are from overseas, so he is obviously someone’s illegal pet … he had been in captivity his entire life, he is used to being held.”But a missing tail and scars across its body suggested the snake had lived a rough life.Burmese pythons are an illegal species in Australia. They aren’t venomous but if they escape into the wild, as this one did, they can wreak havoc on the ecosystem.“It eats the food that our native species needs, in other words, competes with that native species, and there’s potential for introduction of viruses … a snake for America comes in and he can wipe out the Australian population,” Harrison said.After the massive snake was bagged, Harrison’s first call was to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to collect the illegal animal.The second was to his son Jensen’s school to make sure he got a chance to meet the impressive python.“When we pulled it out of the car he couldn’t believe it was real,” Harrison said.” This is the biggest snake you will come across.”Australia’s strict biosecurity laws mean that the python is likely to be put down.“It was a bit sad … to be playing with it and having it in the back of our car, knowing that that’s where it is going,” Harrison said. “Within an hour of catching it, it was in the back of a biosecurity car.”The maximum fine in Queensland for keeping a prohibited reptile like a Burmese python is $130,550."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a946fa02772617baf0e333b8b76490970040e2c5/0_184_3630_2177/master/3630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9d2ef2a82e6321d8b53ec624e90a2e6","title":"womens game is now riddled with uncertainty for clubs and players","story":"Most players are on short contracts, and because of coronavirus some teams may also find themselves cut adrift by their parent clubsIt has been said repeatedly, recently, that football, like many other things, no longer exists in a bubble. No area of society is able to stay immune from this crippling disease. There will be casualties in every sphere of life. Football is no different. Women’s football is no different.Amanda Vandervort, the chief women’s football officer for Fifpro, the global players’ union, said the coronavirus pandemic could be “a major setback to the growth and progress we’ve made as an industry” and called for a “smart and collaborative approach, a common vision that unites national strategies and implements regulatory interventions to ensure we minimise setbacks.”Having spoken to sources at Women’s Super League and Championship clubs, a picture has emerged of the challenges clubs, players and the FA face in trying to mitigate an inescapable crisis.Women’s teams in England operate overwhelmingly at a loss with, generally, parent clubs of varying financial strengths footing the bill. With clubs across the men’s pyramid facing the financial consequences of postponed games, it is inevitable women’s teams will, apart from those associated with the biggest Premier League clubs, be impacted.For the majority of women’s teams, turnstile and other matchday income does not cover the cost of ground contracts or hire, staffing and travel. The broadcast rights for the women’s game are owned by BT Sport and the BBC, who cover their costs rather than paying for rights. This means postponements are significantly less impactful on women’s teams. The biggest losses will be felt through covering player, coaching and staff contracts through an extended season and a potential loss of sponsors.They face the same questions as the men’s game. Who wins the league? Who gets a Champions League place? Who gets relegated? Who comes up? Except the financial implications of those decisions, or that of a voided season, are insignificant by comparison.That puts pressure on the FA to maintain a united stance on the resumption, or not, across professional football the Premier League, EFL, Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship. There is a logic to a united position: split things up and they could be accused of mixed messages at a time when clarity in society is sought after.However, the huge sums of money involved in the men’s game and the consequences of season cancellations or premature conclusions are very different to the problems faced in the women’s. And, even with the best will in the world, it is impossible to not see the teams who have the most to lose or gain, those in the Premier League, dominating decisions.There is widespread sympathy towards the situation the FA is having to deal with. It does appear that support for women’s teams may be on the cards, with clubs being asked to submit their expected losses and costs to the governing body.An FA spokesperson said: “These are unprecedented and challenging times for all industries around the world and football is no different. We continue to work tirelessly with the football community, across every level of the game, to assess the impact of coronavirus, while taking the important steps to support the welfare of clubs, players, staff and supporters.”The lack of a definitive decision on the season is stopping clubs from being able to plan for the future and provide answers to players and staff. On the other hand though, one source voiced concern that the outbreak could be a perfect storm for some clubs that would see it as an excuse to cut loose their women’s teams and that wrapping up the league now could prompt a dismissal of players and staff.Either way, players stand to lose. Footballers in the top two tiers of the women’s game are rarely on contracts of more than one year. Bar a handful at the very top, they are not yet afforded the security of lengthy contracts familiar in the elite men’s game. With the majority of contracts ending in June, and some only paid until the season was set to end in early May, players have been anxious to learn their fates and it is not implausible that, should the FA seek to play out the league season, players could find themselves playing their remaining games for other teams.Many players at Championship level on semi-professional contracts have second jobs and will also find their off-field employment impacted too. Scarily, these are players in one of the most secure footballing environments for women in the world.Vandevort highlighted the extent of the struggle globally. “After speaking with a number of players over the past several days, a few things have become clear to me,” she said. “First, communication is all over the map and, for the players, crisis management is happening largely at a club-by-club level. Some clubs are communicating consistently and clearly with their players, while others seem to barely share any information at all.“Second, there is a great deal of variance on whether clubs are allowing players to leave and return to their homes and families. In such a time of a global pandemic, players deserve the ability to make the choices that are best for their inidual health and well-being. Lastly, we’re hearing situations where player contracts are already being cancelled, and others where clubs have already restructured their budgets to eliminate women’s football altogether.“These times are unsettling and players are finding themselves in precarious positions regarding where they’ll be throughout the quarantine.”Vandevort said players should continue to contact Fifpro, but is also keen to direct them to local player associations. “We welcome players to get in touch with us if they have questions, but as a first point of contact wherever possible, I’d advise players to first reach out to their domestic unions since they’ll be most familiar with local labour laws and domestic footballing environments. It’s also worth sharing that over the last few years many of the advances in women’s football have come when players and their national unions have worked together to achieve progress.“From Denmark, to Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Cyprus, Spain and the US, women have achieved progress collectively. On an inidual basis it can be challenging but with teammates alongside you can become much more influential and can create long-lasting positive impacts.”It is highly likely teams will fold and players be discarded. Collective organising and experience sharing could be key in helping players navigate through this tumultuous period. Hopefully, clubs and governing bodies will rise to the challenge of providing support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68d386bf2ca71ea4b78712f1390315a8c4f5c8b/0_46_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54f721a7a26164e2aadd378cc0e1f227","title":"a league postponed as australian sport grinds to a halt due to covid 19","story":"The A-League has been postponed with a few rounds of the regular season remaining, bringing all top-level sport in Australia to a halt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Football Federation Australia announced on Tuesday morning the competition would be put on hold for the foreseeable future with the “heartbreaking” decision to suspend competition to be reviewed on 22 April.FFA remains optimistic of resuming the 2020 season at some stage, although CEO James Johnson admitted concern over the impact of the decision on the governing body’s finances.“As a national competition played in all parts of Australia, as well as New Zealand, mission complicated became mission impossible,” Johnson said.“We will feel this. We will feel the financial pressure on the game at all levels. “The game will survive ... will we need to make changes? Be different? I say yes.“Whenever there is a crisis we need to look for opportunities. Once we get through this, we need to look at what’s on the table.”Monday night’s game between Newcastle and Melbourne City, won 2-1 by the Jets, proved to be the last for the time being, despite FFA’s hopes of playing out a condensed version of the season.“To get so close to completing the competition, only to pull up a few weeks short, has been heartbreaking for the players, clubs and fans,” Johnson said. “That said, the health and safety of our fans, players, volunteers and staff has always been the overriding consideration for us.“That is fundamentally what led – with the unanimous support of the state and territory member federations – to the suspension of grassroots football until 14 April 2020. Today’s decision was equally difficult to make but it is borne form the same rationale.“As the largest club-based participation sport with nearly two million participants, we have a clear and obvious duty to play our part in doing whatever we can to support the efforts to slow down the spread of Covid-19.”The A-League was one of few major sporting competitions globally still running at the beginning of the week, but the federal government’s advice on Monday against all non-essential travel within Australia effectively made the continuation of the season untenable.The decision follows that of the NRL on Monday to suspend its season indefinitely, while the AFL had put its men’s competition on hold a day previously and cancelled outright the AFLW season.The W-League season was able to be completed over the weekend, with Melbourne City crowned champions after the grand final was played in an empty stadium.The decision to put the season on hiatus received the approval of the players’ union and Professional Footballers Australia CEO John Didulica said the break could be used to the game’s advantage.“During the league’s pause, we can take some control back by ensuring the players can work with FFA, the clubs, the broadcasters and the government to collectively secure the professional game’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d90b4830f1b073f35078fd6aadd2d191286fa2f/0_247_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f46d70614fc6b2868ac415c8be245e4","title":"readers recommend podcasts to binge on while youre cooped up in self isolation","story":"From Australian gothic mysteries to bawdy absurdist comedies, here are your recommended podcasts to while away this time of coronavirus social distancingThis podcast tackles the biggest business failures of all time.

But afterwards Hannah, now 31, could not remember which platform, or even the station, she had seen the man on.She looked out for him for weeks. Then, after leaving her office early one day, she saw him again – at Finsbury Park station. Next time, she promised herself, she would ask him out.The next day, there he was again.It was busy on the platform, so she hung back, steeling herself to go up to him. Ten minutes passed – and three or four trains. Imran noticed her still standing there on the platform. “You still here?” he asked.It was not “the most confidence-building thing” that has ever been said to her, Hannah remembers – but she seized her chance.“I said to him: ‘Are you a single man?’ He was very taken aback and said: ‘What, me?’ I thought: ‘Well, who else am I talking to?’”Imran did not have a working phone – which Hannah would come to know as typical of his haphazard approach to comms – so she gave him her business card.Imran, now 44, says he had never been asked out at work before. “It was a big surprise – a nice surprise.”He had noticed Hannah on the platform: “I thought she was gorgeous.” He also thought she might be “dangerous”. “To be honest, I was a bit worried. I was thinking: ‘What does she want to get with me for?’”At the time, Imran had been single for seven years, busy raising two children – then aged 16 and 17 – from a previous relationship. Dating had not been a priority.Their first date was a few days later at a pub near the station – “not even a nice pub”, says Hannah. She still ribs Imran about meeting her round the corner from where he worked, so his colleagues wouldn’t see them.She had worried there would be awkward silences, but they were still talking at closing time. It came as “a bit of a shock” to learn that Imran had two teenagers, Hannah says – “I took a huge gulp of my gin and tonic” – but it did not put her off. After the pub closed, Imran took Hannah to his favourite local chicken shop, and they ate sitting on a bench outside a club.It was “relaxed and convenient”, rather than glamorous, says Hannah – but they went on only one more “datey date”. “It became quite domestic quite quickly.”She remembers a point about six months in when Imran said he would be gone for an hour, then got caught up in errands and family, and went off-grid for the day – “a typical Imran thing”, she now knows. “I realised, as I was imagining these terrible scenarios, that I loved him, and that was why I was so irrationally worried and upset.“It all came out in this blubbery mess. I thought there was no way that this man was going to tell me he loved me, too – that he was far too guarded – but then he did.”A little over a year after their first date, just before Christmas, Hannah moved in with Imran and his younger son in Islington. “The house just feels better,” says Imran.He describes his relationship with Hannah as “two worlds meeting”, but they share values and like to spend time in the same way. He says she is intelligent, articulate, caring, empathic. “I like everything about her. She’s so good at everything she does, she doesn’t take any shit – I like that a lot.”Hannah says Imran is open-minded, patient, forgiving – “the yin to my yang”. “He’s got bundles of tolerance and compassion where I’m quick to be impatient, annoyed and judgmental. He’s definitely helped me to be a better person.”They bring out the best in each other, Imran agrees – this interview being a case in point. “I really wouldn’t normally do something like this because I’m such a private person. I think what did it, was she said: ‘Maybe it will give hope to somebody else.’”• Want to share your story?

The next I was at No 1’ I was the drummer in FBI, a jangly guitar band in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire. After I started writing a few tunes, I became the singer. Pete Waterman, the producer, saw us at a showcase in a working men’s club in Warrington. He heard my voice and went: “I can make a record with that kid.”I signed a deal, but within months Stock Aitken Waterman started having No 1s, so I was put on the backburner. Somebody – probably Pete – suggested I come and live in London so I wouldn’t get the hump and they could keep an eye on me. I lived in Pete’s flat. We’d go into the studio every morning and he’d be on his giant 80s mobile phone doing deals. I worked at the studio, making tea and sandwiches, but also watching how SAW made their records.They put out a single by me and Lisa Carter as Rick and Lisa, which didn’t do anything. Then they got a Fairlight synthesiser-sampler delivered. I helped them get it out of the box. I remember Mike inputting the chords to Never Gonna Give You Up. I made the tea while their programmer, Ian Curnow, did the basic track. Mike sang the melody literally into my ear and I went in and sang it. He was a tough producer but he needed to be. I was a kid who’d sung in pubs and clubs.We shot the video in an old church near London’s Westway. All the clothes in the video are my own. There were no stylists – I shoved some stuff in a bag. I really liked the song. I remember thinking: “I’d dance to that if it came on in a disco in Warrington.” I thought it sounded like a hit and suddenly it was. One day I was making the tea. The next I was at No 1.I turned up at Monks Social Club in a silver Ferrari. I don’t think anyone in Warrington had seen a Ferrari before, never mind a silver one. I was ill with flu, so I said to the guy on the door: “I’ll do 20 minutes, then I’ve got to get to bed.” But I stopped to watch the gig. I thought Rick’s voice was outstanding. And he moved quirkily, too. He reminded me of Van Morrison.I said to his manager: “Don’t like the band. Don’t like the song. I’ll sign the singer.” We put Rick on a Youth Opportunities Programme government training scheme. I wanted him to understand the music industry and be a real artist. He made the tea while the likes of Bananarama, Mel and Kim and Dead Or Alive made records, soaking it all up like a sponge. His voice was so strong that finding a song for him that worked was difficult. In some ways, he was actually too good.On Boxing Day that year, I was bored at home so I went into the studio. We pulled out Rick’s track and did a new version but forgot about that as well. Then one day someone played it in a meeting and everyone went: “What is this?” And the rest is history.It went to No 1 in every country, including America. Because he looked so young, people thought it wasn’t actually him singing – Radio 1 rang him up in a hotel in Scotland and made him sing it in the bathroom.• Rick Astley’s The Best Of Me is out now.

And he said that gathering in groups of more than two was prohibited.The newly announced restrictions follow days of controversy over whether the UK was moving too slowly to force Britons to stay at home except in exceptional circumstances as the death toll reached 335.Four other large countries with significant outbreaks of the virus have moved at a variety of paces and taken different steps to enact their own lockdowns, most – but not all – acting before reaching the UK’s death toll:Lockdown in Hubei province begins 23 January with death toll at 17China, where the first cases of coronavirus emerged, was the first country to announce a major lockdown, in Wuhan and the other big cities in Hubei province. At the time of the announcement, the disease was confirmed to have claimed 17 lives and infected almost 600 other people, although it is not clear how accurate a picture this represents after the first cases emerged in mid-December.In the early hours of 23 January, residents were told that from 10am that day all public transport would be closed and residents of Wuhan were forbidden to leave the city, although large numbers are believed to have fled before the lockdown. By late afternoon, roads from Wuhan and other exits had been shut off.Lockdown begins 9 March with death toll at 463 and 9,000 infectionsItaly imposed its lockdown after attempting a limited quarantine of northern towns and then a chaotic quarantine of the north only that led to thousands attempting to flee.The lockdown restricted movement of the population except for necessity, work and health circumstances. Additional restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. Two days later, the lockdown was tightened to close all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, such as grocery stores and pharmacies.Lockdown begins 15 March with death toll at 288 and 7,753 casesAfter a marathon cabinet session the day before, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told Spaniards they were banned from leaving home except for work and for essential travel. Cases had exploded at the start of the month, with 30 deaths by 9 March.A state of emergency also ordered the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. People are allowed out only to work, to buy food and medicine, to travel to health centres or banks, and to look after the elderly or dependants.Lockdown announced on evening of 16 March with death toll at 148 and with 6,633 confirmed casesFrance had reached China’s 17 deaths around 8 March and moved to a full lockdown just over a week later. Similar to the Italian lockdown, French citizens were tightly restricted, with people expected to stay at home, leaving only for essential activities such as food shopping on pain of a fixed fine of €135. Officials later clarified that a dispensation for exercise meant walks or runs of no more than “1km, 2km max” and close to home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8bc891ea440f0ad3547c22459ae4cdcb7036848/0_297_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c20b64459013a07c2f9394bd36b386","title":"labour chairman ian lavery coronavirus comments","story":"Tories outraged after Ian Lavery said outbreak was an opportunity to bring people together The Labour chairman, Ian Lavery, has hit back at criticism after he was recorded saying the coronavirus outbreak gave the party a “great opportunity” to bring people together and get on the “front foot”.His comments sparked outcry among rightwing commentators, Tory politicians and a former Labour MP. They suggested he should apologise for allegedly seizing on the crisis to make political gains. Lavery claimed reports about the recording, obtained by rightwing Westminster blog Guido Fawkes, were misleading and he had been trying to rally grassroots party members to help their local communities and explain that Labour’s established network of campaigners had a significant role to play.Speaking to thousands of young members who joined an online chat forum on Friday night, the close ally of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was recorded saying: “By the way, when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence.“But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour party members, community champions out there, a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it brings people together.”Responding to the recording of Lavery, former Labour MP Ian Austin, who quit the party over the way it had handled antisemitism complaints, wrote online: “This is shameful.”Lavery, who is MP for Wansbeck in the north-east of England, tweeted that he had been “extremely proud” of the Zoom call, which reached young party activists and that everyone had a role to play in trying to combat the spread of the virus.He wrote: “We have a battalion of over 580,000 members and we need them to help in this crisis.”In another Tweet he wrote: “Intentionally misleading reporting is really disappointing at a time like this. I’ve spoken about the opportunity for people to get out there and help their local communities and those in need. Nonsense to suggest otherwise. We all need to do our bit to get through this crisis.”Young Labour, which organised the conference call, said more than 3,000 members had joined in, with Corbyn also taking part in the discussion. It is part of a series of mass calls being organised by the party to deal with Covid-19, including sessions on workers’ rights and mutual aid groups.After Friday’s call, Young Labour tweeted: “The Labour party will continue to demand more from the government to support insecure workers and the most vulnerable, and Labour members in communities will be the centre of local support.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disgusted by Lavery’s remarks, accusing him of “salivating” at the thought of tens of thousands of people dying.A former Tory MEP, Steve Bannerman, who was also a member of Ukip, tweeted: “This disgusting and naked opportunism shows why we suddenly have so many social media attacks on Boris and government handling of Covid-19. Shameful. @UKLabour – would Attlee have done this??”Leftwing commentator and author Aaron Bastani said Lavery was simply highlighting that the response to Covid-19 would “demonstrate the uses of central planning and need for grassroots activism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf103f6ae01edb899269ffdca6bed8d39d35f84/831_1208_4067_2440/master/4067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aec72f6a35dd31a725af5b652cbb8f22","title":"do you have a scientific question about covid 19 coronavirus","story":"’s Science Weekly and Today in Focus podcasts want to hear your questionsAs the coronavirus outbreak continues to unfold, many of us have been left with questions.

There seems little alternative for the IOC with so many athletes are unable to train properly because facilities are shut and countries in lockdown.Canada and Australia have already confirmed that they will not send athletes to Tokyo this summer, while the British and French governments have urged the IOC to make a quick decision.That view is supported by British Olympic chiefs, especially given many of the 600 Team GB athletes who are due to go to the Olympics and Paralympics are unable to train as planned. Robertson said: “We can’t see any way that this can go ahead as things are constituted at the moment and I expect we will be joining Canada and Australia shortly.”Pushing back the Games until 2021 is by far the most likely option. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has conceded postponement is now a possibility if the Games could not be held in their “complete form”.The IOC president, Thomas Bach, has said he will take the next four weeks to deal with the complex legal and financial problems before making a decision.A growing chorus of British athletes, including Dina Asher-Smith, Britain’s 200m world champion, are voicing their frustration at the IOC. “Does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training — whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway?” Asher-Smith wrote on Twitter.Dai Greene, the former 400m hurdles world champion, said he was having to flip tractor tyres on his partner’s farm and use bales of hay for box jumps to keep fit. “On Saturday morning, I went to recce the local 400m track by one of the private schools near where I live,” he said. “I even had a look at the fence and wondered to myself – can I jump over it?He added: “The world’s athletes need answers now, not in mid April.”Ed Warner, the chairman-designate of GB wheelchair rugby and a respected voice in British sport, said Bach had misjudged the mood of athletes by setting a four-week deadline on Sunday to decide the fate of the Games.“The IOC has said it will make a decision in four weeks,” he said. “It hasn’t got that long. It probably has only got four days. The right thing for the IOC to do is to announce it will postpone the Games immediately – and then use the next couple of weeks to decide when it will be. Athletes have led the way on this and the IOC have trailed far them. That has to change.”Warner also urged the IOC to heed the voices of Paralympians who are particularly worried about Covid-19. Athletes with a degree of paralysis from the chest downwards have reduced lung function, which means they are more vulnerable should they catch an infection. “Athlete welfare must always be our top priority,” Warner said.Opposition to holding the event in July has risen sharply in recent days, with US Track and Field and UK Athletics among those calling for a delay. Brazil, Norway and Slovenia have also pressed the IOC to consider postponement but have not threatened a boycott.The head of safety at the London 2012 Games, Lawrence Waterman, also urged the Games to be delayed, saying the need for precautions against coronavirus such as physical distancing and self-isolation means groups of people cannot be safely assembled to test the venues for crowd control.“These games need to be postponed and the sooner the IOC and the Japanese government face up to this the better. It’s simply not safe to put the Games on during a global pandemic,” Waterman said. “People’s safety and health should come before the costs of delaying contracts.”The veteran IOC member Dick Pound told USA Today the Games would be postponed, likely to 2021. “The parameters going forward have not been determined but the Games are not going to start on 24 July, that much I know.”Pound said the IOC would announce its next steps soon. “It will come in stages,” he said. “We will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f429336adba3e0539c4092c095aed35ec42371/0_93_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=221f6a337382b2db2e94bdc5d2889065","title":"coco gauff grand slam title tennis prodigy","story":"Unscheduled season break could benefit a young player with the world at her feet – at just 16, a first major is hers to takeCoco Gauff’s career is idling along with those of all her locked-down rivals, but her mentor, Patrick Mouratoglou, who has guided Serena Williams to 10 of her 23 grand slams, thinks the American teenager can win a major whenever the tour resumes.“I can see Coco getting to a final and winning a grand slam,” he says, “and I feel she is not that far away.”That is a serious – if hardly impartial – vote of confidence in a 16-year-old who has risen from 685 in the world 15 months ago to 52 when the WTA suspended the women’s Tour this month because of coronavirus. Tennis is tentatively scheduled to return in June, although it is more likely to reappear much later than that.Mouratoglou has worked with Gauff at his academy in the south of France for six years but was as surprised as anyone when it took Simona Halep to stop her in the fourth round at Wimbledon last summer. Gauff was, at 15 years and three months, the youngest in the Open era to reach the main draw. Halep, in the form of her life, went on to crush his main client, Williams, in the final.The French coach was less shocked when Gauff made another impressive run at the Australian Open in January. She beat Venus Williams for the second time in the first round of a slam, then the defending title-holder, Naomi Osaka, before losing, again in the fourth round, to the tournament’s eventual champion, Sofia Kenin, her 21-year-old friend and compatriot.Mouratoglou is encouraged that Gauff is very much a work in progress. “The match against Sofia Kenin in Melbourne showed Coco needs to improve. Of course she does. She still plays at an incredible level and the self-belief she has is so strong that she can surprise and maybe win a grand slam. The Australian Open is gone, but why not another one?“Coco’s tennis is already big. She has a lot of things to her game a big serve, unbelievable backhand, she does a lot of things. She is able to come to the net. When it is a pressure point, she is able to go for it. She will also play a return volley to put pressure on her opponents.“She already understands a lot of things in tennis, but still it is not enough. There is still some space for her opponents to win the points.“Definitely there is still room for improvement. Her maturity is incredible at 16. That’s what stands out most for me. The ways she handles matches, it’s unique. But she is still only 16 and, when you are only 16, you still have so many things you need to improve, which is great.“The players she has beaten in the slams – Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka – and making the second week of a slam again after making the second week at Wimbledon, at that age, having so much to improve, it says so much about her as a person.”Gauff has won eight of 11 matches in three of the four grand slams and has placed herself alongside young contenders and champions such as Kenin, Osaka, the 19-year-old US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova.Gauff, along with her peers, can do little more than work on her game and fitness while the global halt to sport expands by the day. She had hopes of going to the Tokyo Olympics in July, but that door is closing by the hour. However, the unscheduled tennis break could benefit a young player who is still growing towards physical and emotional maturity at extraordinary pace in an unrelenting environment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0925f48c7bb2143cd92bb40b5c4070d745565af/0_165_3707_2223/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7e37209fa52098fca413aa7f152728","title":"my favourite game usain bolt wins olympic 200m gold beijing 2008","story":"No one had got near Michael Johnson’s 1996 world record until the Jamaican giant scorched the Bird’s Nest and seared historyNo one was ever going to beat Michael Johnson’s record. Not in my young lifetime anyway, maybe some distant day when I was old and grey, and athletics had changed out of all recognition.Remember watching him set it at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had and he finished five metres back.Over the next decade, no one got near. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62, Xavier Carter in 19.63, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65. They were the second, third, and fourth quickest 200m sprints in history, and Johnson’s time was so far beyond them it was in another realm altogether. Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus’s foothills. There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt – a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors.Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finish line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so. He was one.What is less well remembered now is just how upset some people got about it all, how the president of the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, called him out for “disrespecting his competitors” and said it wasn’t “the way we perceive being a champion”.Watching in the Bird’s Nest stadium, it wasn’t the swagger that bothered me but the split seconds it had cost him. We didn’t know, then, whether Bolt would run that fast again – Johnson never did – which meant he, and we, might never find out what he was capable of, where his limits, our human limits, really lay.Until four days later, when we found out.Bolt explained he had not been bothered about breaking the 100m world record, since it was already his. The 200m mark, Johnson’s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet. Bolt did not have the speed endurance, he said, or the technique to handle running the curve, not at the levels he would need to beat that time. And who knew better? So far all he had done was trot through the heats and here he was clowning around on the start line without a care in the world.Then the gun went. His start was smooth and fluid, by midway around the curve Bolt had made up the stagger on the four men outside him, by the end of the curve he was metres ahead of them, and now it was just him racing history, chasing Johnson’s ghost.Bolt was out there on the very limits of possibility, pushing, pushing, pushing. This time he did not slow, there was no early celebration, he even threw his head and chest ahead in a dip finish. The clock stopped on 19.30sec. He had done it by two hundredths. I remember thinking, up in the stands: “So this is what it looks like when God tries for the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ff85d92cfd932385bd9ec3f43a6a94a946b6674/0_0_5391_3235/master/5391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e52dda8c7ad7dc8f41e25b1ded53e7a4","title":"polly swann continues tokyo preparation in isolation","story":"A silver medallist in Rio, the rower will continue her home training programme until the Olympics are officially postponedUntil last week, Britain’s rowers were some of the few sportspeople in the country still engaged in full‑blooded competition. Great Britain’s squad trials for Olympic selection were held behind closed doors but brutally fought. It was, says the Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann, one of the closest trial meetings she has experienced in her career.Swann’s pairs race was a “real ding-dong” against a pair including her own housemate, Rebecca Shorten. Sometimes, she says, trials can be more stressful than international competition. “You have to try to beat your friends, and you know how much it means to them.” The 31-year-old Swann and her partner, Emily Ford, were squeezed out in the last 200m.Swann is now off the water for the foreseeable future. On Saturday, Caversham closed its training facilities and moved all its athletes to at-home training programmes. Covid-19 had already caused the cancellation of all World Cup rowing and while the European Championships in June remains for now, the probable postponement of the Olympic Games is dominating the International Rowing Federation’s agenda.Having recently completed the medical degree she began 13 years ago, Swann has no illusions about the seriousness of the pandemic and yet her desire to compete at the Olympics remains as strong as ever. “We have to believe there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” she says. “The Olympics is almost like a drug. That’s why athletes are able to put our lives on hold, move away from our loved ones, get up at ridiculous o’clock in the morning. So until there’s any kind of announcement that says there’s a postponement, we have to trust the Olympics will go ahead and we’d be silly not to do everything we could to prepare.” Isolation plans for the rowers had already been drawn up: exercise bikes and rowing machines will now take up space in lounges or bedrooms but Swann is used to awkward training regimes. Having resumed her medical studies after finishing second with the women’s eight in Rio, a sense of unfinished business drew her back to the sport. Trying to fit a bursting schedule of hospital rotations, exam revision, gym work and sleep into each 24-hour cycle nearly broke her.The week before her finals, a 5km indoor session left her in tears. “My coach was saying: ‘Polly, you’ve just got to do it.’ And I said: ‘I don’t know if I can.’ At the time it felt like the worst thing I’ve ever had to do. Now I’ve got a bit of perspective. It wasn’t a global pandemic, put it that way.”Swann grew up in Edinburgh her mother is a former midwife and her father is a doctor, providing frontline help during the crisis. Swann, who is not yet registered with the GMC and will need a training post before she can practise, never imagined doing anything other than medicine.At school she showed some sporting aptitude, but her height made her “ungainly” – “I didn’t know where my legs and arms were in space and time,” she says, laughing. Struggling with hockey – she had an extra-long stick but still found reaching the ball on the ground difficult – she swapped to rowing and was quickly smitten.Back injuries kept her out of contention for the 2012 Games the following year, she found herself paired with Helen Glover, who had won Britain’s first gold in London with Heather Stanning. “We first got into a boat together in January of 2013 and I just remember being petrified,” says Swann, who remembers thinking: “‘Do not make a mistake.’” But Glover was a perfect mentor who “poured her heart into rowing” and by August that year they had won the world championships together.When Glover reunited with Stanning for their second Olympic gold in 2016, Swann took a place in the women’s eight, who nearly pulled off one of the most dramatic comebacks seen on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. Up against a USA boat unbeaten for a decade, the GB eight’s strategy was simple: start fast and stay with them. They did neither. At the halfway mark Britain were last.Swann remembers thinking all was lost when cox Zoe de Toledo made a bold call and began their sprint finish nearly a kilometre early. A surge of energy coursed through the boat, which soared up the field. “You get this all-encompassing belief from moving through the other boats,” Swann says. “Within 300m I was like ‘We’re going to win the Olympics.’“We were coming hot and heavy on the Americans and then with 100m to go my legs gave in and my lungs were exploding. I could hardly move.”USA took gold by two seconds but Swann and her teammates were thrilled with their fighting silver.Swann still wants a gold but her attitude to the Olympics has changed. Desperate just to make the team in 2016, she feels Tokyo would be, by comparison, “a bonus – the one I get to enjoy”. Which boat she may compete in remains a matter for the selectors. Swann enjoys the art of pairs racing – “you really get to feel the glide of the boat and how to move it well” – but also enjoys the sprint style of the eight, a charge she calls “vicious and electric”.The anxiety caused by the virus cannot be avoided – not in a sport overseen by a 73-year-old coach who must take special precautions to self-isolate as per government advice. Jürgen Gröbler’s charges had been joking he would probably self-isolate in a caravan by the side of the lake so he can keep an eye on them now he’ll be poring over data from their machines. A natural extrovert who thrives on teamwork, Swann finds the prospect of physical distancing challenging but she already has plenty of her favourite tea in the house and has made a deal with Shorten that they will learn the guitar together.Whether she can fingerpick by the summer is uncertain whether the Olympics will happen even more so. But it’s a guarantee Swann and her fellow rowers will not sacrifice an iota of their training, wherever they have to do it. “We know the rest of the world will do the same,” she says. “And I think there’s something quite powerful behind that motivation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/643d27a11eda9c663cf27af44de0af3d74a45262/0_17_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff45d7b520daf665bfb63c0ceb87fcba","title":"talking horses devon loch bellyflop remains a mystery after 64 years","story":"Cramp seems the most likely explanation for Grand National runner who seized defeat from the jaws of victoryAt 3.24pm on Tuesday, it’ll be exactly 64 years since Devon Loch performed the most famous bellyflop in sports history. We’ve all seen some glorious examples of defeat being seized from the jaws of victory but, for sheer, sudden dismay, it’s hard to beat the horse who jumped all the fences in the Grand National, battled clear on the run-in and then fell over with just yards to go for no evident reason whatsoever.Here’s the footage one more time:I make it seven strides that the winner, ESB, takes from the point where he passes the capsized Devon Loch to the winning post. All that work to cover four miles and all Devon Loch had to do was take another seven strides …In all my years watching racing, I don’t think I’ve seen a single other example of a horse doing exactly what Devon Loch did, so it’s very hard to know what happened to him and why. A popular theory is that he saw the wing of the water jump in the side of his eye and thought he’d better take off at the last second.Some reckon he was shocked by the noise of the crowd, in full throat as it anticipated victory for a horse carrying the Queen Mother’s colours. Attendance would have been a lot bigger than the modern 70,000 in those pre-health and safety days, four years before the National was first shown live on TV.Perhaps he slipped on a false patch of ground? It was reported that a stop cock was found leaking by the water jump and supposedly it had led to a damp patch on the run-in.But, looking at the replay just now, I found myself thinking: “Cramp.” So its interesting to open the autobiography of his jockey, Dick Francis, and find these words: “In the actual second of his fall, I thought he had broken a hind leg, for he collapsed from the back, but when I found that he was unhurt, cramp seemed the only solution.“Obviously, Devon Loch did not suffer from any prolonged cramp, for he was walking normally within two minutes of his fall, but a violent spasm equivalent to stitch seems a reasonable possibility. Veterinary opinion seems to be that it is so rare as to be almost unknown. On the other hand, a retired huntsman told me he used to ride a mare that did the same thing. She collapsed twice without warning in the hunting field while galloping, and after that he felt that she was more of a risk than a pleasure ...”Anne Holland also turned up some evidence in favour of cramp in her 1988 book Grand National: The Official Celebration of 150 Years. She quotes Alex King, who worked at Devon Loch’s yard, as suggesting that research at the time showed a link between human athletes taking glucose and suffering cramp. “We used to buy glucose for the horses by the crateful from Boots … There was never a barrel of glucose at Fairlawne again after Devon Loch.”Anyway, you can relive the race here and tell me your theories below. Once we’ve solved this one, we can crack on to the question of how The Lamb managed to change colour from his first National win in 1868, when he was grey to his second, in 1871, by which time he was nearly black.Tuesday’s best bets will appear here by 10am"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b441363a59ca36a28a5e190a7163fcdfa75484/0_245_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90f6495efc1a2ab965c07460134227e6","title":"sport radio chat show coronavirus isolation","story":"Shared experiences between people in separate places are quite the thing right now – plenty find the radio a comforting friendBig Del died last week. A fixture in my Brixton local, he hadn’t been in since Christmas and the cancer did for him pretty quickly in the end. Nobody in the pub, not even those closest to him, had known he was ill because he seemed the type who probably didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him.A retired drayman, Del was a sweary old-school Londoner who loved his football, rooted for “those facking Gooners” and was England till he died. We’d even fallen out over it once nothing serious, a clash of nationalities more than personalities. He knew this mick co-presented a Sunday morning radio show on TalkSport and always made it abundantly clear he tuned in whenever he could. Occasionally in the strongest possible terms.More often than not, however, he came armed with a good-natured dig regarding anything he perceived to be controversially anti-Arsenal or England that I or my co-presenter Max Rushden might have said on air with which he disagreed. Our shared Sunday mornings in completely separate places meant we were never short of things to talk about when our paths did cross in the pub.Shared experiences between people in completely separate places are quite the thing now, whether they are cyber booze-ups on Zoom, Mother’s Day meet-ups on Google hangouts or groups of friends staying in touch through the medium of gallows humour on WhatsApp. And as people struggle with the anxiety of uncertainty in these weirdly unprecedented times, it seems plenty find the familiarity of old friends, some of them people they have never met on the radio, weirdly comforting.Sitting alone typing this column for a newspaper’s sport section at a time when there is no sport to write about, I am almost certainly not the only listener being kept amused by the sound of sports commentator Sam Matterface jovially bickering with his sidekicks – the former footballers Perry Groves and Stuart Pearce (each of whom I have met through work) – on a nearby radio.With four hours to fill on a Saturday afternoon that should have been jam-packed with football action, the panel are instead discussing the profundity of their urbane and dapper host’s ignorance on the subject of what a “larder” is. The word had cropped up in conversation, Perry had been agog that Sam had never before heard it and now all three are arguing over whether or not having a room specifically devoted to food storage in your house means you’re “posh”. I am prepared to concede that maybe you had to be there.Fast forward approximately 24 hours and Max and I have just come off the air after our two hours on TalkSport and, while tricky, it was highly enjoyable. Even in the absence of sport the show must go on and as purveyors of jovial, utterly inconsequential mid-morning tomfoolery we are apparently somehow considered key – if not absolutely key – workers at this difficult time.During a frightening period when we have seen the very best and very worst of people, medics, shelf-stackers and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus have been rightly lauded for their heroic efforts. Meanwhile the challenges being met by a pair of idiots with hours of sports radio to fill and precisely no sport with which to fill it have gone unheralded. That’s OK, we’re not in it for the glory or the plaudits. What Nick Cave once memorably described as “this tumbrel – this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes”.There are those out there who will argue that filling time by “playing” the postponed FA Cup game between Sheffield United and Arsenal through the medium of a quiz is considerably less stressful than pulling 48 hours on the A\u0026ampE ward only to wind up weeping in the car park of an empty supermarket. What’s more, they would be absolutely correct. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is those questions didn’t ask themselves on Sunday, ultimately resulting in a highly controversial Arsenal win that comically enraged many listeners who support Sheffield United.Meanwhile on the ’s Football Weekly podcast, Max and I have vowed to continue delivering our twice-weekly show covering all the football that is not being played for as long as it takes and feedback has been heartwarmingly pleasing even if results have been mixed. A recent episode featured discussions about Australia’s A-League, Stuart Broad’s evolution as a top-class bowler and a monologue on the finer points of wood-chopping.It is a privilege to be lucky enough to have radio shows and podcasts to look forward to producing in the company of likeminded iniduals at a time when so many people have never felt so isolated, utterly bereft of companionship and downright bored. The inherent sense of camaraderie and community is a source of comfort and it is to be hoped our inane natter provides some sort of company and sense of familiarity to listeners whose ears are otherwise under constant assault from others engaged in far more important and largely depressing chat.I suspect Big Del would have got a kick out of tuning in to radio coverage of Arsenal denying Sheffield United a place in the FA Cup semi-final in a preposterously complicated radio quiz, effing and jeffing throughout and making a mental note to remind me of how the Blades had been the victim of “a facking stitch-up” when next he saw me down the pub.Although I never told him, I got a similar kick out of hearing from him and others who were out there tuning in to and laughing (or seething) at the latest drivel Max and I had dreamed up. With the world halfway to hell in a handcart, now seems as good a time as any to make sure each and every other one of our other listeners knows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7c1aca3fe8732340bf3f09ab214e910f392eee/0_113_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f54ed2c8fb015b3689645383c68a53","title":"broadway coronavirus theater actors writers crew members","story":"As the pandemic shutters Broadway and beyond, writers, actors and crew members must acclimatize to an uncertain new worldLast Tuesday, Jessica Altchiler led a ballet class. But instead of the long, sleek barre she would normally rely on for support, she grasped on to a TV stand. And if that alone didn’t prove she wasn’t at a conventional dance studio, the red-and-black plaid pet bed in the background gave her away.Still, she tendued, relevéd and coached other dancers, even though she couldn’t see them.“I’m already sweating!” she said as she ducked into the camera frame. “I hope other people are sweating, too.”Not even a week before she was teaching on Instagram Live, Altchiler had been in Detroit as part of her first professional job in the national tour of Fiddler on the Roof. While she and her fellow cast members performed in the show, they saw headlines about Broadway shutting down and March Madness being cancelled. Then, their own tour dates were postponed, and a suddenly unemployed Altchiler boarded a nearly empty flight back to her family home in Connecticut.“It’s strange for me to think about people still having a job because, for me, the world was just turned upside down,” she said.All of the savings that she and her co-workers had been carefully growing to move to New York, pay for an apartment or invest in classes now have to be redirected toward survival during this unprecedented time in theater history, and some of her colleagues are scrambling to find a place to stay after months on the road.As the world wrestles with Covid-19, Altchiler’s new reality isn’t particularly uncommon among artists. Theater professionals are frightened, and they’re mourning a lot of art that may never again see the light of day as venues shutter at least temporarily and would-be audiences disappear. But even as performers suffer great personal and professional losses, they’re working overtime to send messages of hope and peace, provide necessary resources to others who are struggling and offer a balm for the social-distanced and self-isolated.On an at-home edition of The Tonight Show last Wednesday, Lin-Manuel Miranda joined Jimmy Fallon to raise money for Broadway CaresEquity Fights Aids’ Covid-19 emergency assistance fund. The Hamilton star performed his song about parents wanting to give the best possible version of the world to their children, as parents everywhere, including Fallon and Miranda, stare down a global crisis alongside their own kids.Also online, the theater legend and radio host Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley, his producer husband, quickly organized twice-daily at-home performances to fundraise for the Actors Fund. A long list of Broadway A-listers immediately signed up. Kristin Chenoweth was all dressed up when she appeared on the web series from her bathroom over the weekend, and on Saturday, Lea Salonga will call in to sing at 2am Manila time.“Artists love the world, and they love helping,” Rudetsky said. “So every single person we wrote basically just wrote back right away and said: ‘I’m in, I’m in, what do I do?’”Meanwhile, theaters are trying to figure out how to stay afloat and take care of their own as the very notion of live entertainment has become taboo. Susi Damilano, co-founder and producing director of the San Francisco Playhouse, said she hasn’t had to fire anyone, and she’s asking hourly workers to submit their schedules on a week-to-week basis for compensation. She’s hoping patrons will donate the value of a ticket and landlords will ease up on rent if not, her playhouse will only be able to pay people for a few months.“I think that the arts and culture are proving to be where we all turn in times of difficulty, and yet are the first and hardest hit economically,” said Damilano. “And people are realizing that.”As theaters take a financial clobbering, some are requesting that playwrights refund advance payments. Lynn Nottage – one of America’s foremost playwrights who has earned two Pulitzer prizes for her work – was asked by a large regional theater to return her advance, even as everything she had scheduled was cancelled before her eyes and she lost what would have probably been the majority of her income for the year.Nottage said most companies aren’t making such requests, but she did worry about what’s going to happen as theaters – another place where people go to heal – close down for the time being. She empathized with the young artists who had debuts in Seattle, New York and Chicago, the up-and-coming actors, playwrights and directors who usually present work during this time of year and even the singers who were performing in her first opera at Lincoln Center.On Broadway, young performers who were ready for their big breaks got caught in limbo, some even before their first performances. Michael Lepore, who is making his Broadway debut alongside 12 others in Sing Street, had just walked on the Lyceum Theatre stage for the first time when all of Broadway closed at least until April.“It was all these dreams come true, with this thing hanging in the air of like, ‘Oh God, this is going to be it for a little bit,’” he said.With everything delayed, he retreated to his parents’ home in Connecticut with all his instruments – as a cover, he’s required to know the show on acoustic and electric guitar, bass, piano, synthesizer, baritone electric guitar and stylophone. He’s been getting his notes in order and making sure he’s off-book. But he’s also started working on his own music, and he’s recording a few things.People are adapting, Rudetsky said. Quoting the musical Closer Than Ever, he started to sing: “‘If someone told me even just a week ago … I would have said you’re crazy, I’d have burst right into tears, but here I am.’“Yes, the things we plan on happening are not gonna happen,” he said. “But, who knows what will happen?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84eac3378603252a54687ca57026dc10b671db7d/0_283_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1dd6726180999ff7b16d8b6c3982f7","title":"tendu with tamara rojo online ballet classes to try","story":"Dancers are sharing their skills online as venues are shut due to the coronavirus. Our critic stepped up to test one outThe core of a ballet dancer’s life is daily class. Whether it’s a child just starting out or a prima ballerina, a dancer’s day begins with pliés and tendus at the barre. Now in this strange new reality prompted by coronavirus, dancers are stuck at home like the rest of us. But they have to keep their pointes on pointe, as it were, and some are sharing their daily routines with the public, encouraging you to dance along with the pros.Last week, English National Ballet livestreamed a class from the company’s new studios in east London (still available on YouTube, with more being added). It’s more than 20 years since I took a regular ballet class, but who could turn down the opportunity of dancing with the one and only Tamara Rojo, ENB’s artistic director and one of the world’s finest dancers? I pulled on some leggings, pushed back the table and repurposed the kitchen counter as a barre.Rojo explains each exercise while a few dancers are spread out in the background. The sound and lighting in the studio aren’t great, but that doesn’t impinge on the pleasure of spying the latest dancer fashions, the many incomprehensible layers they wear to keep warm – puffy boots, shorty dungarees and Rojo rocking one full-legwarmer in red and black stripes. All of these are gradually shed as the class goes on, to reveal a ballet butterfly underneath.The pianist strikes up and it’s straight into some tendus (pushing the foot along the floor into a point), then lifting the leg to make tiny circles in the air – if you’ve done a barre fitness class, you’ll know this special kind of torture. A great sweeping port de bras, bending forward and (supposedly) doubling over at the waist, sees my hamstrings yelp into action.Inevitably, as the dancers’ quicksilver feet pick up speed, and out of nowhere Rojo’s leg whooshes effortlessly up to her ear, they leave me far behind. I stop to marvel at a backbend. It’s in the very fabric of a dancer’s art to make it look easy, and after you’ve watched a lot of ballet you can become a bit blase about this crazy level of athleticism. But to dance along with a class is to physically feel how exceptional their ability is, and to observe the details of their technique undistracted.Apart from hitting my knee on the dining table doing a pirouette, this was a welcome interlude to the day. When you’re cooped up inside (or usually hunched over a laptop), even just standing up straight, lifting your chin and majestically sweeping an arm above your head fills your lungs with air and your heart with peace. At which point the reality of current circumstances intrudes and my two-year-old bowls in demanding, “I want a biscuit, mummy! I want telly!” and all that zen calm crumbles. Ballet’s spell is broken.Tiler PeckThe New York City Ballet principal is streaming a daily class on Instagram from the kitchen of her family home, dancing to Taylor Swift and showing she’s an absolute natural as a teacher. (“No soft knees!” she brightly scolds her virtual pupils.)Claudia DeanThe upbeat Aussie enthusiasm of former Royal Ballet dancer Claudia Dean has made her a social media star for bunheads. Her first attempt at a livestream crashed because it was so popular. More are in the offing, but in the meantime there’s a whole YouTube channel of tips and tutorials for all levels to explore.Andrey Klemm Andrey Klemm is the central casting version of a ballet master, a terse, straight-backed Russian, dressed in black. But he’s the real deal, and you can see him teaching Paris Opera Ballet étoile Amandine Albisson on his YouTube channel. The camera sometimes lovingly lingers on Albisson’s face and forgets the feet, so perhaps you’re not entirely expected to follow along.McOnie CompanyIt’s not just ballet out there, of course. Musical theatre choreographer Drew McOnie has moved the popular classes he usually runs at Pineapple Dance Studios online to Instagram Live, every Thursday at 7pm.SteezyEven before the coronavirus outbreak there were plenty of places to learn to dance online.

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: At this point, we don’t have a test to tell that. We are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use yet. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to get tested while you have it and to have that test be positive.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. (Editor’s note: recent reports  suggest that loss of smell and taste are also signs of Covid-19 infection.)When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. If somebody is diagnosed with a case of coronavirus, I might feel a little bit more strongly that they should tell people because if you’re in close contact with a healthcare worker, it could have implications for precautions that healthcare worker needs to take.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d49b173a97d9a63ebcc7c74133ffd92727fc54/0_199_4702_2822/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d5db080a03b5ce1bd802eff4f7c211a","title":"coronavirus britons abroad urged to return to uk immediately","story":"Foreign Office asks up to 1m British citizens to cut short trips and come home straight away Up to 1 million Britons on holiday or on business trips abroad have been asked to return to the UK immediately by the Foreign Office as they may not be able to get commercial flights within days.In updated advice, the FCO said British citizens abroad who were resident in the UK should make urgent plans to cut short holidays and other trips and come back home straight away.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said: “We are strongly urging UK travellers overseas to return home now where and while there are still commercial routes to do so. Around the world, more airlines are suspending flights and more airports are closing, some without any notice.“Where commercial routes don’t exist, our staff are working round the clock to give advice and support to UK nationals. If you are on holiday abroad the time to come home is now while you still can.”Officials fear anyone who delays may not be able to secure flights by the end of the week, leaving them potentially trapped far from home. However, critics of the government point out that many people are already marooned abroad because of travel restrictions in other countries and are in desperate need of repatriation flights.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is seeking an urgent meeting to force a government repatriation programme with up to 1 million Britons stranded abroad with no commercial flights or no free seats running from countries such as New Zealand.After New Zealand announced it was going into lockdown this week, a WhatsApp group of more than 300 people claimed the British embassy had been “appalling”, with airlines not taking calls or simply cancelling flights with no notice.On Saturday, Raab announced he was laying on flights for more than 500 Britons stranded in Peru, after an avalanche of criticism.The British government has also been criticised for allowing flights to continue from the worst hit countries such as Italy and Iran. However, Whitehall sources have defended the continuation of commercial flights, saying it is essential that Brits should be able to get home.Doctors who are among those stranded overseas told the  they were desperate to return to help their NHS colleagues battle the coronavirus outbreak but that they had received little help from the Foreign Office.One doctor, who works at one of the busiest A\u0026ampE departments in the country, said he was due to fly home to the UK from Pakistan on Sunday night but arrived at the airport to find his flight was cancelled and that they were stopping all international flights with immediate effect. He was told there would be no flights for another fortnight at least.“At a time when doctors are being called out of retirement, and everyone is being asked to pull together and help amidst this crisis, I feel so helpless as I am stranded abroad with no means to come back home,” said the doctor, who asked not to be named.One GP who is stuck in New Zealand with his wife, who is also a doctor, said he was “trapped” with no way to come back to the UK after travel restrictions were imposed. He said he tried to contact the consulate by phone and social media, and ended up taking a flight to physically visit the office in Wellington only to be turned away on arrival with nothing but a list of generic websites.Another said he and his friend had gone out to New Zealand to work for six weeks in Auckland City hospital and Starship children’s hospital, but were stuck with no help from the embassy. “Our colleagues are fighting a war back home that we should be helping with,” they said.The Foreign Office did not respond to the accusations about embassies, but said in a statement: “We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health.“We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff:I’ve been an A\u0026ampE doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive.On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe.This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A\u0026ampE department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients.Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A\u0026ampE department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower.The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now.Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point.There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when.On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it.Some people are treating this as a holiday – but without correct distancing measures it’s a disaster waiting to happen. When we are faced in the coming weeks with choices about who gets the last ventilator and who doesn’t, it will be that young person who has gone out socialising, who has ignored advice, who get it. That means someone else’s mother may not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5c4baa5e93a4f6f2cfa1b9f5013edf305b4653/0_183_3653_2191/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b657be85e7a256344a6445a262186bf5","title":"uk lockdown what are new coronavirus restrictions","story":"The updated advice for Britons, including on shopping, taking exercise and travelling to workIn brief: an Italian-style lockdown to force people to stay at home beyond a small range of very limited circumstances. Under the terms explained by Boris Johnson in his TV address, people will be allowed to leave home only for the following reasons:Meeting friends, shopping for anything beyond essentials, and gathering in crowds are now banned.Police will be able to enforce the rules, and impose fines on people who do not abide by them. Authorities will force the closure of all shops selling non-essential goods, including hair and nail salons, and all markets apart from food markets. Also closed will be libraries, outdoor gyms and playgrounds, and churches or other places of worship. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs, campsites and caravan parks will also be closed, apart from to permanent residents or key workers. All public gatherings of more than two people will be banned, except if those people share a household. Also prohibited are all social events such as weddings and baptisms, although funerals will be permitted to take place.At least three weeks. Johnson said that after that point, the government will relax the rules “if the evidence shows we are able to” – but this is by no means certain.The hope is to severely limit the scale of physical and social interaction, and thus slow the spread of the coronavirus so that the growth in cases does not overwhelm the NHS and lead to mass deaths. As Johnson put it: “Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope.”This remains to be seen – and given the time lag between infections and people becoming critically ill, it will be up to two weeks before any benefits are realised. On Monday, Italy recorded a slight reduction in the number of coronavirus deaths, two weeks after it introduced a national lockdown. So the UK can expect an exponential growth in infections and deaths first, before – hopefully – the curve flattens.There has been a gradual increase in restrictions, going from ministers urging people to work from home if possible and avoid pubs and other crowded places, to schools and nurseries being closed, and then on Friday the forced closure of pubs, clubs, restaurants, gyms and other communal businesses. However, the information on physical distancing has thus far been framed as advice, with Johnson stressing the desire of people to be out of doors.Opposition parties and, increasingly, some Conservative MPs have been pushing for tougher restrictions on people’s movement, especially following much-shared photos over the weekend of crowds in national parks and elsewhere. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “We must move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It’s time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but enforce social distancing rules.”Many other European countries have taken a lockdown approach, generally a week or so before the UK. Italy saw a ban on almost all movement in the north of the country which was extended, and then intensified, with only a selection of vital shops and businesses allowed to open, and police checking on people’s movements. Spain and France have taken similar measures.The most extreme approach was taken in China, where authorities essentially sealed off 11 million people in Wuhan, where the virus first began spreading, before extending the quarantine zone to take in more than 50 million people. People were kept in apartment blocks, with visitors and almost all outside movements banned. Other measures included compulsory temperature tests, and the placing of those feared to be ill in isolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ac589cb433b3d647ea338c789e2dcd0065fc85f/30_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445ee52b63a47e40d43f73ea5fc42ed","title":"weird and wonderful ways to get through the covid 19 lockdown","story":"There is a growing array of web-enhanced activities to pass the time in social isolationAs the coronavirus crisis deepens and the advice is to stay at home, people are becoming increasingly creative about how to cope.

On Monday the club was up to Vol 1, Part 1, xviii-xx and the sixth anglaise is being danced in the Rostov’s ballroom.For Hook it was a more challenging “child killing sea captain but make it fashion”.• It’s not weird but it could well be wonderful. London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts is encouraging people to listen to some of the 900 talks and discussions which were staged at the ICA between 1982 and 1993.They are available on the British Library’s Sounds website and include Ken Campbell (fondly described in his  obituary as “one of the strangest people in Britain”) interviewing Derek Jarman a rare chance to hear the playwright Caryl Phillips in conversation, notably with Graham Swift and the surprising opportunity to hear Jonathan Aitken and Enoch Powell give their views on secrecy and the state.• Learn to salsa, cha cha cha or waltz.

The car is parked on the street outside, with a box of water in the boot. Do you risk it?Such have been the sort of dilemmas facing people in Jordan since Saturday morning, when the Middle Eastern kingdom introduced one of the most stringent anti-coronavirus regimes in the world.It was announced at 7am by rounds of air-raid sirens: every person in the country indefinitely confined to their homes. No grocery shopping. No trips to pharmacies. Not even a walk around the block. Those with medical emergencies could call the authorities, but anyone caught outside would be arrested. More than 800 people have been picked up so far, the military says.Videos circulating on social media show army Humvees patrolling Amman’s beige streets. Another clip showed a veiled woman who parked her car in the middle of an empty street and danced to the music blaring from her stereo. Local media reported later reported her arrest.Jordan has undergone the same whiplash-inducing shift to a new era as other countries. Nine days ago, cafes were full, tourist sites were open and just person had tested for the virus, and recovered.In a cascade over the next days, flights were cancelled, Jordan’s airport closed, the borders of Amman sealed, non-essential businesses shut and, finally, everyone ordered to stay home.The curfew, imposed because people were flouting the government’s plaintive requests to stay home of their own volition, was announced at 3pm on the day before it came into force, triggering an immediate run on bakeries and supermarkets. In the hours before people would be isolated from each other for their protection, they were pressed shoulder-to-shoulder buying bread and milk.On Monday, a government spokesman told Jordanians the curfew would extend for weeks, and they should make do with the basics until then. An unprecedented scheme for delivering bread, water and pharmaceuticals to the population of 10 million is being trialled from Tuesday, though how it will work is still unclear. Ministers have already warned citizens to get used to the absence of luxuries.Possible problems abound. Will there be enough workers or cars to deliver on what is sure to be enormous demand? Will farmers and distributors be allowed out to keep the food system running? And what happens when people run out of cash?For my circle, the toll of the curfew so far has been an accumulation of small inconveniences. The elaborate meals we planned to cook during isolation have been pared back. Supplies of hay fever medicine in our house have dwindled to a single pill. A friend with two dogs can’t walk either of them but says they are entertaining each other, for now.But Jordan has shouldered far more than its fair share of refugees from across the region. On farms, in the poorer quarters of cities and in sprawling camps, more than 650,000 Syrians are also confined to their homes. There are few more resilient communities in the world, but most cannot afford to stockpile food for weeks.“Those who can look after themselves are looking after themselves,” Ahmed, a Syrian who fled to Jordan from the city of Hama, said last week. “Those who don’t have food, don’t.”The gamble is that a few weeks of difficulty might spare Jordan the horror that Italy, Iran and others are experiencing. Jordan has 112 coronavirus cases so far, with all but one said to be in good condition. The country’s health system is ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the least prepared in the region to fight a pandemic. The government had to act fast, and drastically.If those who are confirmed to be sick are properly treated if asymptomatic cases are confined long enough for the virus to work its way through them, their households and environments if authorities can keep people satisfied long enough so that they adhere to the rules and if the borders remain closed, preventing new cases from entering – Jordan could avoid the worst.Four big “ifs”. On Monday night, the third day of the curfew, Jordanians gathered on their balconies to sing and cheer in solidarity with each other and health workers. It is to be a nightly ritual. Over the next weeks, it will convey the public mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a6c9a05dfbe8b80193a8256cff54d2993a6f08/0_14_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca893637bd7d0cf242144db9cbf14c76","title":"how coronavirus stopped a 23000km american odyssey","story":" Martín Echegaray Davies was about to cross into Canada when Covid-19 stopped him in his tracksNothing on his 23,000km (14,000-mile) walk across desert, jungle and mountains was going to stop Martín Echegaray Davies, 62, in his determination to walk from the southernmost tip of South America to Alaska. Nothing, that is, except for the closure of the US border with Canada amid efforts to contain the coronavirus.Since last Wednesday, the Argentinian adventurer has been holed up in a hotel room in Fargo North Dakota, after braving temperatures of -31C (-24F) as he headed up US Route 81 to Pembina, the last American city before the Canadian border – only to be turned back by the announcement that the crossing would be closed to “non-essential traffic”.“Of course I’m frustrated,” he told the . “I made it all the way to the Canadian border, but I’m going to have to end my walk here.”Echegaray’s trek started on 31 October 2017, when he set out from Lapataia Bay, 23 kilometres south of Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, on the southern tip of Argentina, pulling his heavy sleeping cart behind him.“The hardest part, apart from the freezing North Dakota winter, was crossing three different mountain ranges in Colombia. The cart really started to feel heavy there. It slowed my usual speed of 40 kilometres a day to about 20 kilometres.”As he made his way north, two flags fluttered from his cart: the blue and white Argentinian triband and the red dragon of Wales – Echegaray Davies is a proud descendant of the first Welsh immigrants who arrived in Patagonia in 1865 aboard the clipper Mimosa, which sailed from Liverpool carrying 153 settlers (including 22 Davieses). He credits the harsh weather conditions of his Patagonian upbringing for his incredible physical stamina. “I’m used to harsh weather conditions and spending all day doing hard work.”For now, he is waiting to see if he can catch a flight back to Argentina – although it is unclear when that will happen. Echegaray is one of around 30,000 Argentinians who were left stranded abroad when the country closed its borders to flights from abroad last week. They have slowly started trickling back on special flights arranged by the country’s government.“Maybe I can come back next year to try and finish my walk, but honestly, I don’t think it’ll happen,” he said.Despite his last-minute stumble, the trip has been worth it, he said. On his Facebook page he has posted 1,718 selfies with people he’s met along the way.In a farewell video he posted in Fargo last week, Echegaray said: “Thanks everybody so much, those who contributed money, or a place to stay. A big hug to everybody.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7833d73b91a1cd0af5dae01184a942d07950e262/0_126_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a24eefceeb06a1196b61331adf147cf","title":"nearly 20 of global population under coronavirus lockdown","story":"Britons told to stay at home while Trump goes against tide, saying economy will reopen in weeks, not months Around one in five people around the globe are under lockdown, ordered to stay home as the world enters a critical week in responding to the accelerating coronavirus pandemic.As of Tuesday there have been at least 378,679 confirmed cases of people with the virus across the world.

Hope you are staying well and keeping spirits up as best you can, whatever your situation.The lockdown now in force means people across the UK may only leave home in a small range of limited circumstances. They include shopping for necessities one exercise outing a day, such as running or cycling, alone or with household members for medical reasons or, for example, to care for a vulnerable person and going to work, if you cannot work from home. “The time has now come for us all to do more,” said Boris Johnson in a televised address to the nation. “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home.” Last night, emergency legislation including sweeping powers to ban gatherings and forcibly quarantine suspected coronavirus patients was passed by MPs without opposition.Meeting friends, shopping for anything beyond essentials, and gatherings of more than two people are banned. Police will be able to impose fines on people who do not abide by the rules. All shops selling non-essential goods, including hair and nail salons, must close, along with all markets apart from food markets, and all venues such as libraries, playgrounds, churches, hotels, B\u0026ampBs, campsites and caravan parks (other than to permanent residents or key workers). Social events such as weddings and baptisms are off, but funerals are permitted. Oddly, bosses at Sports Direct and Evans Cycles have claimed the group’s stores will remain open “where possible” because they sell home exercise equipment, which, management argues, makes them a vital asset, according to an email seen by the PA news agency. Away from the UK overnight, in a televised press conference from the White House, Donald Trump has said he wants to get the US economy going again as soon as possible and is not open to the idea of restrictive public health measures going on for months.“Our country was not built to be shut down,” Trump said. “This is not a country that was built for this.” The president’s approach to the emergency continues to confound: he has sweeping reserve powers to deal with the crisis, but given his veering public pronouncements, no one is confident about what he may or may not do.Around the world, about one in five people – an estimated 1.7 billion – are now living under some state of lockdown. There are at least 378,679 confirmed cases. More than 16,500 people have died, while almost 101,000 have recovered. The first 100,000 cases took 67 days to emerge the latest 100,000 just four days, but “we are not helpless bystanders”, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, which is urging continued urgent global action.

The jury found Salmond not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after about six hours of deliberations. They returned a verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Speaking afterwards, Salmond said there was “certain evidence I would like to have seen led in this trial but for a variety of reasons we weren’t able to do so. At some point that information, that fact and that evidence will see the light of day but it won’t be this day, for a very good reason.” The SNP leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the verdicts “must be respected” and her focus was on the coronavirus crisis. “I have no doubt that there will be further discussion around this issue in due course.” Libby Brooks, Scotland correspondent, writes this morning: “The verdict brought the most significant case in Scottish legal history to an end – but it also marked a new chapter in a fight that could tear the SNP leadership apart.”Britain held to rights – The UK’s low age of criminal responsibility, minimum pay rates for young teenagers and failure to completely outlaw corporal punishment breach Council of Europe standards, according to its latest report. The council has 47 member states including Britain and is separate from the European Union. It regards its findings as legally binding but the UK government does not. Criticisms in the report include permitting pain-inducing restraint techniques, “inadequate” statutory maternity pay after six weeks, and lack of an independent right to remain for family members of migrant workers who exercise their right to “family reunion”. In terms of corporal punishment, the Council of Europe is critical of England, Wales and Northern Ireland where smacking, defined as “reasonable chastisement” remains legal it was recently banned in Scotland.Tap it, don’t catch it – The contactless limit for in-store spending is to increase from £30 to £45 from 1 April to cut the need for physical contact.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The LE Samuel Beckett on Sir John Rogersons Quay is being used as a coomunity sampling centre. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Government is set to introduce further measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus on Tuesday, with a ban on all non-essential travel, commercial and social activity among the unprecedented options to be discussed by Ministers at the Cabinet’s weekly meeting.Public health experts are meeting early on Tuesday morning to consider a range of possible actions and will advise the Cabinet of any new restrictions they believe are now necessary to slow the spread of the virus.However, it is expected that significant new restrictions on travel, work and movement will be announced, which are likely to mirror recent moves made by several European countries and by the British government on Monday night.Among the options under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which will make the recommendations to Cabinet, are the closure of non-essential business premises, playgrounds where they have not been closed already, and stricter implementation of physical distancing in parks and on beaches. There is a reluctance in Government to close public spaces. Some restrictions on public transport may also be considered, although sources pointed out that numbers using trains and buses had plummeted. The Government is also due to announce a multi-billion euro package to prop up incomes and boost emergency welfare payments as part of measures to tackle the deepening coronavirus crisis.Two more patients died from Covid-19, the NPHET said on Monday evening, and a record number of 219 new cases were reported.There are now a total of 1,125 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. Meanwhile, “ten of thousands” of people are seeking to be tested each day, Dr Holohan revealed, and priority will be given to healthcare workers and the sickest patients.Support packagesSources on Monday night said the cost of the Government’s package of supports would likely run into billions of euros. One element will be a substantial increase in the €203 welfare payment announced earlier this month for people who lost their job due to the Covid-19 emergency.The second element is an income support scheme similar to that announced recently by the Danish and UK governments. The Irish scheme will take weeks to fully set up but the outline is set to be announced by the Government on Tuesday. The precise details were still being worked out on Monday night.The scheme will see the State pay businesses 70-80 per cent of a worker’s salary up to a level of €35,000-€40,000, or about the average wage, and the business will then pay the worker.Businesses applying for State support will have to prove their income has dropped by 25 per cent and that they have liquidity difficulties.One-tier systemThe Government is also likely to order that holders of private health insurance will receive no special privileges for hospital admissions during the crisis.Sources say the health service will operate essentially as a “one-tier” system, with admission to hospital decided solely on clinical need.At present people who buy private health insurance – almost half the population – can often secure speedier access to many treatments, while hospitals rely on income from the health insurers which pay them hundreds of millions of euros a year.However, Government sources say this system will be suspended while the health service deals with the Covid-19 outbreak.The Government is close to concluding an agreement with private hospitals to bring their capacity effectively into the public system, adding 1,900 beds as well as 200 ventilators to help deal with the expected influx of patients in the coming weeks.The two new Covid-19 deaths involved males in the east of the country, and brought the total number of deaths to six.Dr Holohan said he was “very pleased” with the response of the public to the restrictive measures introduced 10 days ago, and said the aim was for “most of the people to comply with most of the measures most of the time”.With the backlog of people waiting to be tested reaching 40,000 over the weekend, he said it was still the intention to “test as quickly and as broadly as possible”.Dr Holohan said there may be a lot of “worried well” among the tens of thousands seeking tests but he expected demand to drop over time.Asked whether any completed swabs had expired while waiting to be processed, Dr Holohan replied: “I can’t honestly say that hasn’t happened.”A number of food and drink outlets, including McDonald’s, Supermac’s and Starbucks, announced they would close due to the pandemic. Bank of Ireland also announced the temporary closure of 101 outlets. Knock airport said it would cease operation from next Monday until further notice.Breakdown of casesMen account for 55 per cent of cases, according to an analysis of cases reported up to last Saturday.Some 29 per cent of patients have been hospitalised, and 25 per cent of cases are associated with healthcare workers. Twenty-five patients have been admitted to intensive care units.Community transmission now accounts for 45 per cent of cases, close contact with confirmed cases for 23 per cent and travel abroad for 31 per cent. Some 37 clusters have been reported, involving an average of five to six cases each.The World Health Organisation warned the pandemic was accelerating. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000,” WHO director general Dr Tedros said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210314.1584997181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus enhanced income supports due to be announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPubs closed in Temple Bar, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA new enhanced package of supports for those affected by the coronavirus pandemic running to billions of euro is expected to be announced by the Government on Tuesday.It is understood that the extended package of income supports will have two elements. One will be a substantial increase in the €203 weekly welfare payment announced earlier this month for people who lose their job due to the Covid-19 emergency.The second element is an income support scheme similar to that announced recently by the Danish and UK governments, which would see workers continue to receive a significant proportion of their salaries up to an overall cap. The move is aimed at allowing workers and their employers to retain links as the coronavirus crisis deepens.The Irish scheme will take a number of weeks to fully set up but the outline is due to be announced by the Government on Tuesday, although the precise details were still being worked out on Monday night.It is understood the scheme will see the State pay employers 70-80 per cent of a worker’s salary up to a level of €35,000-€40,000, or around the average wage, and the business will then pay the worker. It is expected that the scheme will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.When the overall package is announced, the intention is that those in receipt of income support payments and the Covid-19 welfare payment will receive roughly the same.Other sources said that businesses applying for State support would have to prove that their income had dropped by 25 per cent and that they had liquidity difficulties.Union pressureThe move follows pressure from both union and employer representatives, who over the weekend proposed income support packages to run for several months at a cost of €1.75 billion-€2 billion.Separately, other proposals under consideration by Government officials could see creche workers redeployed to care for the children of key workers in their homes.The proposal, if adopted, would provide continued employment for childcare workers and could see a payment by the State to creche owners, which could be used to fund wage payments.However, it is understood that this proposal is one of several under consideration by the Department of Children, in consultation with the National Public Health Emergency Team. The plan may yet not be adopted, or elements of it could be included in a hybrid plan. Sources are optimistic that a childcare plan for frontline workers will be finalised this week.However, it must meet with the approval of the emergency team, who must be satisfied that the childcare plan does not expose healthcare workers, gardaí and other frontline staff to undue risk. That will be the final criteria for approving a plan, sources said. Options that included the mixing of children from different families in a group to be minded are highly unlikely to meet with approval from the team.Insurance problemSuch a plan would also have to address issues around the provision of insurance to cover the childcare workers, as existing policies would only cover them providing care in dedicated creches.She said she was considering funding options “for the period beyond March 29th and what conditions may need to apply so that we can best use the public funding available to support the sector during this time”. However, she said key meetings with other departments still needed to take place before she could offer clarity on the future of the sector.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210242.1585002315!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government set to announce new travel work restrictions","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has warned that Ireland is at an early stage in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.

There is a reluctance in government to close public spaces.The meeting comes following the death of two more patients from Covid-19. Both involved males in the east of the country, bring the total number of deaths to six.Another 219 cases have been reported, the biggest daily increase seen yet, the NPHET said on Monday evening.There are now a total of 1,125 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Dr Holohan said he was “very pleased” with the response of the public to the restrictive measures introduced 10 days ago, with most people acting “very responsibly”.“We didn’t set out to have every person comply with every single measure the aim is for most of the people to comply with most of the measures most of the time.”But he said he was “not satisfied in every situation”. Where pubs were found to be in breach of the measures, the new powers available could be used to effect closure. The Garda’s assistance had also been asked in relation to social distancing.He said it was too early to evaluate the success of the measures but this would be considered at the next meeting of the team on Tuesday. This meeting will also decide whether the measures will be extended beyond the original end-date of March 29th.With the backlog of people waiting to be tested reaching 40,000 over the weekend, Dr Holohan said it was still the intention to “test as quickly and as broadly as possible”.He said “tens of thousands” of people were now seeking testing every day as demand increased, and this was putting pressure on services. As well as healthcare workers, people with clinically advanced forms of the disease in hospital would be prioritised for testing.Dr Holohan said there may be a lot of “worried well” among those seeking tests and it was expected demand would drop over time.While the average waiting time - currently at four to five days, according to the HSE - was “longer than we would like” due to constraints in the supply of testing equipment, the advice for those awaiting testing was still to self-isolate, he said.“We’re on our way to a substantial increase in testing capacity, which should reduce turnaround time.”Asked whether any completed swabs had expired while waiting to be processed, Dr Holohan replied: “I can’t honestly say that hasn’t happened”. More information would be available at Tuesday’s briefing, he indicated.Men account for 55 per cent of cases, according to an analysis of cases reported up to last Saturday.Some 29 per cent of patients have been hospitalised, and 25 per cent of cases are associated with healthcare workers. Twenty-five patients have been admitted to ICU.Community transmission now accounts for 45 per cent of cases, close contact with confirmed cases for 23 per cent and travel abroad for 31 per cent. Some 37 clusters have been reported, involving an average of 5-6 cases each.The vast majority of people are following guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene and are able to recognise symptoms, research commissioned by the Department of Health indicates.Some 88 per cent of people say they are staying at home rather than going out, according to the survey, while 84 per cent say they are practising social distancing in a queue.Seven out of 10 people report they are sitting further apart from others, and most people are aware of the main symptoms of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation said the pandemic is accelerating with more than 300,000 cases now recorded and infections reported from nearly every country worldwide.While it took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases of Covid-19, it took only 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and just four days for the third 100,000 cases, said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.He called for global political commitment to change the trajectory of the pandemic, urging countries to take both defensive and attacking measures. – Additional reporting ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210265.1584994514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus test backlog how did it emerge and can it be controlled","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has warned that Ireland is at an early stage in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Photograph: David Hecker Getty ImagesWidespread testing for coronavirus is among the key pillars of the Government’s plan to slow the spread of the pandemic in Ireland.With a backlog of 40,000 people awaiting a test, to succeed, the State’s success hinges on a plan to ramp up the testing capacity to 15,000 a day in the coming weeks – roughly an entire seven-month flu season’s worth of testing – every day, for months on end.How did the backlog emerge?Ireland’s current strategy – “community testing” of those with symptoms – is designed to build a picture of where and how the disease is developing but, most importantly, to isolate confirmed cases and those with whom they have been in touch.It is worth noting that Ireland’s testing figures compare relatively well to other European countries. According to ourworldindata, Ireland’s rate of 1,350 tests per million lags Austria and Germany, but is comfortably ahead of the UK and France, for example. It is some way off South Korea, considered among the best testing regimes.This strategy, though, has placed unprecedented pressure on Ireland’s virus testing system.The demand for testing exploded from Friday 13th, when the threshold for eligibility was lowered. Anyone with symptoms was advised to contact their GP, who, after a telephone consultation, refers their patient on for testing. The removal of consultation fees was good public health policy, but inevitably increased the demand for testing.During a normal flu season, the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) might carry out 600 tests a week. Now, with the assistance of the other laboratories, 1,500-2,000 test results are produced a day, according to its director, Cillian De Gascun, who is also chairman of the HSE’s coronavirus expert advisory group. The plan is to increase that about 10-fold in the next four-five weeks.Can the backlog be controlled?Much depends on how effective Ireland is at ramping up its capacity. Already, some 41 “community sampling centres” – often mislabelled as test centres – have been set up. The most high profile of these are at stadiums like Croke Park, Páirc uí Caoimh, and next to the LE Samuel Beckett in Dublin’s docklands.The swabs taken at these centres are, generally speaking, sent to the NVRL. More than 10 hospital laboratories have been equipped to analyse tests around the country, but Dr De Gascun says the primary focus for these centres is on their own patients and staff.“Broadly speaking, the hospitals are testing their own patients and their own healthcare workers, and then the NVRL is moving into community testing.”This is in keeping with a wider strategy of providing access for those most in need – the sickest, and those whose participation in frontline efforts to fight the virus will be suspended while they await results of a test.Meanwhile, community testing – the swabs being taken around the country – will be largely sent to the NVRL, which is working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to identify additional lab space and is, according to Dr De Gascun, aiming for “almost a factory-style high throughput model of testing in the coming weeks”.The aim is also to vary the method of laboratory testing done at each centre, so the system doesn’t become overdependent on one type of kit. This is important, as equipment shortages have slowed efforts in recent days.The expectation is a glut of commercial kits will come onto the market in two-three weeks, enabling the further ramping up of testing. In the meantime, the list of those waiting to be tested, and those awaiting results, is unlikely to shrink. About 4,500 swabs can be gathered a day, but only 1,500-2,000 test results come from the labs, due to kit shortages. Forcing that backlog down can be achieved only by ramping up capacity.Should I be worried?There is an emotional toll on those waiting. However, it is worth remembering that for those well enough to remain out of hospital while awaiting their results, the outcome is largely academic. They are being asked to behave as though they have the disease, and self-isolate for 14 days. Unless their condition deteriorates, this is their treatment, with or without a test.Meanwhile, those awaiting tests are advised to make detailed lists of recent contacts while the information is fresh in their minds.

She developed aching limbs and “real fatigue”, she said.‘Hacking cough’The “worst moment” was over three successive nights when she had a “hacking cough” and began to notice she was becoming breathless.“I was definitely getting to the point where I was struggling for breath,” she said.On her test result proving positive, she said: “I can’t tell you what that’s like – it is so shocking.”Byrne said she then “went into guilt mode, because I felt, ‘How many people have I given this to?’ That was my big concern.”“I felt guilty, I felt shocked, and I felt worried,” she added.Byrne made a list of all the people she had spoken to for more than 15 minutes within two metres of her since a few days before her symptoms showed.In her case, the Army called to get these details as part of follow-up contact tracing, to inform those people and advise them of what to do.Byrne said she thinks she is through the worst of the disease at this stage as the shortness of breath has passed.“I still feel quite guilty about the people on the contact list,” she said.“Many of us are going to go though that experience – that’s all part of it.”RTÉ earlier released details of an email Byrne sent to staff in which she said she was “well now and through the peak of the condition”. She expressed her thanks to colleagues who supported her through since her diagnosis.Separately, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said on Monday he had tested negative for the coronavirus. In a statement, Mr Coveney said: “Like thousands of people across the country, I was contacted in recent days by a member of the HSE contact tracing team to say I had been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for Covid-19.“I followed all protocol and was tested. The result is negative for Covid-19.”Mr Coveney did not specify who he was in close contact with, but he appeared on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live two weeks ago in studio with the broadcaster. In her email to staff, Byrne said: ““I made the decision that I wanted you all to know this at the earliest opportunity. The HSE contact tracing system worked with me over the weekend.”She said she was getting better and was working with Medmark and her own GP on when she could return fully to work. Byrne has been in self-isolation for over a week after experiencing cold-like symptoms associated with Covid-19.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Which? calls for Covid-19 not be used as excuse to undermine consumer protectionsGarda\u0026iacute welcome new shift patterns and support from publicState\u0026rsquos strategy for controlling Covid-19 has put unprecedented pressure on our virus testing systemPlans also in place to enable people in temporary accommodation to self-isolateCabinet to discuss ban on commercial, social activity and on all non-essential travelSignificant new restrictions on movement expected after death toll rises to sixEmergency legislation to be rushed through Oireachtas amid constitutional concern over SeanadWebsites being monitored \u0026lsquoto check compliance with consumer protection law\u0026rsquoPaula Farrell has pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughterCharities call for people in HSE risk categories to be moved from \u0026lsquoovercrowded\u0026rsquo centresGarda sources say reduction in cocaine use more likely to be due to economic factors than to closure of clubs and pubsJury returns verdicts in five of 23 charges against 29-year-old manHearing told of \u0026lsquodisgraceful\u0026rsquo behaviour when effort made to pass narcotics to ailing womanBusinesses call for consumers to support Irish online outletsBand in frantic efforts to get home from Chile after airport options worldwide tighten upEmployee fired for claiming 10 buses had collapsed cushions in a two-day periodBut veterinary authorities say there is no evidence of animal to human transmissionStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Emergency legislation to impose a three-month rent freeze and a ban on evictions will be dealt with this week by the Dáil, when it sits on Thursday and by the Seanad on Friday.Ministers will approve the legislation, which is expected to receive all-party backing, at an incorporeal Cabinet meeting today before being tabled on the floor of the Dáil, where it is expected to receive all-party support.The Government is under pressure to accelerate the passage of crucial emergency legislation ahead of the Seanad elections next week to avoid Constitutional hurdles.In the absence of a new government in place, the Taoiseach’s eleven nominations to the upper house cannot be named - which means that the Government’s legislative actions will be strictly tied. Other emergency provisions, including from the Department of Social Protection, could be added to the Bill before Thursday, to form an omnibus Bill, though Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin is to table amendments.Speaking yesterday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government would try to get through as much legislation as it could this week, adding that there is “a risk” that later legislative action could be challenged.However, the Labour Party believes it is constitutionally possible for the Seanad to meet and to change its standing orders to allow it operate without the Taoiseach’s new 11 nominees. Labour Seanad leader Ivana Bacik said its legal advice is that “the Constitution does not preclude the Seanad from meeting without the newly appointed nominees”, as long as the Seanad’s standing orders are changed.Pointing to article 24 of the Constitution, law academic Dr Deirdre Kavanagh said it provides for emergency circumstances where the Seanad can be temporarily bypassed.Under it, legislation, bar proposed constitutional amendments, can stay in existence for up to 90 days if “in the opinion of the Government” it is “urgent and immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace and security, or by reason of the existence of a public emergency, whether domestic or international”.To be used, the Taoiseach would have to certify the need for such emergency legislation in letters to the President and and the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210714.1585032670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus china lifts restrictions in hubei but infections rise elsewhere","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A member of the Cambodian Children’s Fund sprays disinfectants, as a precautionary measure against the spread of coronavirus. Photograph: Mak RemissaEPAChina will lift restrictions on movement in most areas of Hubei province on Wednesday, ending a lockdown of the area brought on by the coronavirus outbreak.People who are cleared will be able to leave the province after midnight on Tuesday.Restrictions on the hardest-hit city of Wuhan will remain until April 8th.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen by 4,764 within a day to reach to 27,436,the country confirmed on Tuesday.A total of 114 people had died, an increase of 28 from 86 published on Monday. Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies will convene a video conference on Thursday to discuss the coronavirus epidemic, multiple sources said, amid criticism that the group has been slow to respond to the global crisis.‘Action plan’G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed during a separate video conference on Monday to develop an “action plan” to respond to the outbreak, which the International Monetary Fund expects will trigger a global recession. A subsequent statement from the Saudi G20 secretariat offered few details.The extraordinary leaders’ summit will be complicated by an oil price war between two members, Saudi Arabia and Russia, and rising tensions between two others, the United States and China, over the origin of the virus, which has infected 378,000 people globally and killed more than 16,500.Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said given monetary policy constraints, the G20 countries’ only option to support growth might be fiscal stimulus, but even that remains in question.“This is because the introduction of fiscal stimulus measures may raise the risk of a debt crisis once the coronavirus epidemic is over such a prospect would have a devastating effect on global growth,” she said.“This is something that G20 leaders will have in mind if they go for stimulus packages.”ChinaDespite lifting restrictions in the Hubei province, mainland China saw a doubling in new coronavirus cases driven by a jump in infected travellers returning home from overseas, raising the risk of transmissions in Chinese cities and provinces that had seen no new infections in recent days.China had 78 new cases on Monday, the National Health Commission said, a two-fold increase from Sunday. Of the new cases, 74 were imported infections, up from 39 imported cases a day earlier.The Chinese capital Beijing was the hardest-hit, with a record 31 new imported cases, followed by southern Guangdong province with 14 and the financial hub of Shanghai with nine. The total number of imported cases stood at 427 as of Monday.China is now tightening restrictions in Beijing and other major cities, as it relaxes them in the epicentre of the virus, Hubei province, which has seen a steady easing of the epidemic.On Tuesday, the Hubei Health Commission said it would lift travel restrictions on people leaving the province starting March 25th, with the exception of the provincial capital Wuhan.Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak in China, will see travel restrictions lifted on April 8th.The city has been under lockdown since January 23rd when the government shut down roads, railways and airports. Residents will soon be allowed to leave with a health tracking code, a QR code which will have an inidual’s health status linked to it.In other parts of the country, authorities have continued to impose tougher screening and quarantine and have erted international flights from Beijing to other Chinese cities, but that has not stemmed the influx of Chinese nationals, many of whom are students returning home from virus-hit countries.Beijing’s city government tightened quarantine rules for iniduals arriving from overseas, saying on Tuesday that everyone entering the city will be subject to centralised quarantine and health checks.The southern city of Shenzhen said on Tuesday it will test all arrivals and the Chinese territory of Macau will ban visitors from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.The number of local infections from overseas arrivals - the first of which was reported in the southern travel hub of Guangzhou on Saturday – remains very small.On Monday, Beijing saw its first case of a local person being infected by an international traveller arriving in China. Shanghai reported a similar case, bringing the total number of such infections to three so far.New wave of infectionsOf China’s four new locally transmitted infections on Monday, one was in Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province. This follows five days of no new infections in the city.The newly-infected inidual is a doctor at a hospital in Wuhan, according to a statement from the local government’s health commission. They have not ruled out that the doctor may have been infected while at the hospital.Guangdong reported on Monday a local case linked to an infected inidual from Hubei.Policymakers are conscious of the potential social instability and economic disruption that a new wave of infections could cause, especially in Hubei, where factories and businesses are only just starting to resume work.Many Chinese say they remain worried about the possibility of a new wave of infections as more people return to work as severe travel restrictions are eased with slowing infections.In Beijing, the city is reopening the Badaling section of the Great Wall, an infamously crowded part of the Unesco World Heritage Site. –ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210273.1584994639!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus france hoping unorthodox virologist can save world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProfessor Didier Raoult, the maverick virologist who says chloroquine cures coronavirusWe could know within two weeks whether Professor Didier Raoult, the French virologist who heads the Mediterranean infectious and tropical disease institute in Marseille, will go down in history as the man who saved the world from Covid-19, or will be dismissed as an arrogant, misguided scientist who raised false hopes.Raoult administered a cocktail of hydroxycloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and azithromycin, an antibiotic used against bacterial pneumonia, to 24 Covid-19 patients.After receiving 600mg of Plaquenil (one of the commercial names for chloroquine) and 250mg of azithromycin for six days, three-quarters of patients tested negative for the virus, while 90 per cent of the control group who did not take the drugs still tested positive.On February 25th, Raoult spoke of Chinese experiments with hydroxycloroquine in a video titled “Coronavirus: endgame!” He hastily conducted his own clinical study and revealed the results in a second video on March 16th.US president Donald Trump apparently learned of Raoult’s experiment through a Twitter post by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. On March 20th, Trump wrongly claimed in a White House press briefing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved what he called “the very powerful” drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19.Trump was corrected by Dr Anthony Fauci, a top expert on infectious disease and a pillar of the fight against coronavirus. But Trump persisted, tweeting the following day that “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE \u0026amp AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”Pharmacies in west Africa, where chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, saw a run on the drug. The government of Morocco purchased the entire stock of chloroquine produced by the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in Casablanca. Some French hospitals are administering Plaquenil out of “compassion” for the families of Covid-19 patients.Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice who has tested positive for Covid-19, “wants to trust” Raoult. Conservative senator Bruno Retailleau is exhorting the government to prescribe it more widely in French hospitals. Petitions supporting Raoult are circulating on the internet.The scientific community is ided. Raoult tested the drugs on a very small number of patients.“For the moment, there is no proof of the efficacy of this molecule on the disease, either for prevention or as treatment,” Dr Thierry Vial, head of a pharmacological centre in Lyon told, Le Figaro. “We have only preliminary data, which is encouraging and should be followed up, but is insufficient for systematic treatment of the illness.”Solid base“One cannot administer treatment without a solid basis, especially not chloroquine, which is not an ordinary medicine,” said Bernard Bégaud, professor of pharmacology at the University of Bordeaux.Pressure on the French government is such that health minister Olivier Véran announced at the weekend that chloroquine will be tested, with three other drugs, on 3,200 patients in the EU’s scientific programme Discovery, which is seeking a cure for Covid-19.Véran said he wants to know if Raoult’s study “can be repeated on a bigger scale in other hospitals, by independent teams”. This was necessary, Véran said, because “Never has any country in the world given authorisation for treatment on the basis of a study like this”.Véran also warned the public not to get their hopes up.“The history of viral disease is strewn with false good news, disappointments and reckless risks,” Véran said.Wariness of Raoult derives from his unconventional appearance, and from his reputation as a maverick. The television channel LCI described the hirsute professor as looking like “a druid in the Astérix comic books”.Raoult, age 68, was born in Senegal, where his father was a French military doctor. He moved to Marseille at age nine, joined the merchant navy at age 18, earned a literary baccalaureat at 20 and then went to medical school.Raoult shares a certain arrogance with Trump and Bolsonaro.“In my field, I am a star, worldwide,” he boasted to La Provence newspaper.“I don’t give a damn what others think. I am not an outsider. I’m streaks ahead of the others.”Like Trump and Bolsonaro, he is also a climate change denier.Yet millions of people are placing huge hopes in Raoult’s study. A high-ranking French civil servant, now retired, who is following the story closely, believes professional rivalry is interfering with the search for a cure.Raoult “is unanimously recognised by leading professors” but “annoys the establishment”, the source says. The fact that Raoult forced the French government to include chloroquine in European clinical tests “proves the strength of his de-Gaulle-like conviction”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210347.1585006280!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus lockdown sports direct to stay open as a vital uk asset say bosses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMike Ashley’s Frasers Group, which includes Sports Direct and Evans Cycles: selling sporting and fitness equipment makes the company a vital asset during a national shutdown.

If they could be tested, they could get back to work, say health analysts. On March 11, NHS England said it would be ramping up testing to 10,000 a day, and called on local hospital laboratories to help with the effort. A week later Boris Johnson vowed that would rise to 25,000 a day.Yet despite promises, the maximum number of tests performed in one day was 8,400 on Thursday March 19. Since then the average daily figure for testing has been 4,573.Lord Crisp, NHS Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health from 2000 to 2006, told The  that the lack of testing of staff was an obvious bottleneck that the Government needed to address.We are seeing these situations where you have three junior doctors living as flatmates- one has a cough and three of them are off work for two weeks, he said. That is ridiculous.As of Sunday, Britain had carried out a total of 78,340 tests, around 1,164 per one million people, far behind many other countries. In Europe\u0027s worst-hit country – Italy – health teams performed more than 3,499 tests per one million citizens (206,886 tests).Most recent figures show that, more than a week ago, Germany had already carried out 167,009, the equivalent of 2,023 tests per one million people, while Norway has tested 6,000 per million (34,583 tests).Meanwhile, South Korea has tested 316,664 people – equivalent to 6,148 tests per one million population, while Singapore performed 6,507 tests per one million people.  Prof Rosalind Smyth, Director and Professor of Child Health, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, who is currently self-isolating with suspected coronavirus, warned that Britain simply had no idea how many cases it had because of a lack of testing. We have really very little idea of the number of  \u0027cases\u0027, and I am concerned that this figure is so misleading that it should not be used.  On conservative estimates, the true figure is likely to be five to 10 times higher. It may heighten concern as people think the case fatality rate is much higher than it is, or provide false reassurance that the number of cases in a given area is much lower than it is.On March 12, Britain said it would no longer be testing in the community and instead only checking people admitted to hospital for the virus, leading to widespread criticism from UK scientists. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, Director-General of the World Health Organization,  criticised countries that are not testing sufficiently, warning them: You cannot fight a fire blindfolded… Test, test, test.He added: To win, we need to attack the coronavirus with aggressive and targeted tactics - testing every suspected Covid-19 case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and tracing and quarantining every close contact. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) also wrote to the Prime Minister saying it was crucial to test NHS workers and provide them with adequate personal protection equipment (PPE). In her letter, Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive of the RCN, said: Our members have been unstinting in their dedication and professionalism to protecting the health and well-being of the United Kingdom - they must be supported by the Government and health sector in return.Our members are coming out of retirement, students are interrupting their studies, and nursing staff are deploying from non-clinical settings, all to support the frontline in the battle against Covid-19.We ask you to personally intervene and act to ensure enough supply of PPE and testing for Covid-19 is available for all nursing staff and our colleagues across the health and care system. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said he hoped that the testing of medical staff would take place as soon as possible so that doctors, nurses and other NHS workers who may not have the virus but are self-isolating can get back to work.He told BBC Breakfast: We are rapidly expanding testing. We have been buying testing kits over this weekend and all of last week to make sure we have as much as possible.He said he hoped to say more about the expansion of tests in the next few days.Experts are also hopeful that a new antibody test, which can tell if people have been infected in the past, will be available soon to find out who is now immune. Prof Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: When this diagnostic does become available, I think it will become a big help in tackling the disease. Most likely this will be reserved for frontline healthcare workers and other key workers first and perhaps vulnerable groups later, before becoming more widely available.However, Dr Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, warned there aren\u0027t enough testing kits to go around the country and officials have refused to reveal how many tests were available to the NHS.Experts said they believe the lack of testing was less to do with unwillingness and more likely to be a lack of kits available and enough people to process the results. Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer, University of Exeter Medical School, added: Are we not testing enough? Yes, we aren\u0027t and this is most probably a capacity issue.We are having to pull out key workers when we\u0027re desperately need them because we\u0027re not certain if they have an infection.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rigorous testing route back free society coronavirus","story":"No one can now be in any doubt: this is the most serious social and economic crisis since the Second World War. If mishandled, the consequences will include millions of lives lost, devastating economic depression, social unrest and political upheaval. There can be few greater tests of decision-making and leadership.In Britain, as in many countries, the decisions made so far involve a vast increase in the role and power of the state. Never in peacetime has a government taken over so rapidly the financing and direction of so many areas of the economy, and never in history has it intruded so minutely into how iniduals live alongside each other.In a crisis unique in modern times, the drastic measures taken are wholly justified. Without a massive increase in government spending and the supply of credit, the economy would collapse, taking away many livelihoods for years to come. And without firm rules on “social distancing”, the actions of iniduals will fall short of what is needed for collective survival.It has become routine to compare these actions to those taken in wartime, and indeed there is no other parallel. As in war, the need to defend the whole of society justifies state interventions that would otherwise be indefensible. There is a long history of the temporary but necessary aggrandisement of state power. In the 1790s, faced with war and the threat of revolution, Pitt the Younger suspended habeas corpus and gatherings of more than 50 people. In the 1940s, Churchill presided over central direction of business on a vast scale.As Boris Johnson tightens the squeeze on the habits of our daily lives, he can be reassured that he is acting in this strong – and generally Tory – historical tradition. But at the same time he should not worry that his visible reluctance to take the most restrictive steps comes through to the public. Critics say it is confusing when he shows an understanding of peoples’ desire to enjoy fresh air and exercise while calling on them to stay apart. But personally I would far rather have a Prime Minister who hates telling the nation how to lead their lives than one who relishes the power to do so.The PM’s reluctance to preside over infringements of liberty will be a valuable instinct in the future. That is because this global crisis represents an earthquake sufficiently powerful to change the contours of politics, including the risk of clearing the ground for the idea of a more powerful state. Already, Chinese news organisations have been trumpeting the effectiveness of a centralised and authoritarian society in controlling the virus, notwithstanding their system’s initial suppression of knowledge of its origin. China’s ability to take action at home and send assistance abroad is being contrasted with chaos and lack of global leadership in Washington.While Beijing takes the opportunity to drive home this message, there will be other countries whose leaders will be reluctant to give up the exceptional powers the coronavirus has induced them to acquire. For radical socialists, the proof that the state can take over paying wages, direct vital businesses and create money without restraint will be a justification for decades to come of ideas in which they have always believed.Those of us who are fundamentally attached to an open, liberal and free society will therefore need to be firm in its defence, keeping three principles in mind.The first is that a crisis as grave as the one we are now experiencing does indeed justify the exceptional curtailment of some customary liberties. While voluntary collective action is to be preferred, government enforced action is much better than permitting a public health catastrophe. Reluctance to clamp down is a virtue, but in a fast moving crisis so is speed and decisiveness. Free societies have to safeguard lives at least as effectively as closed ones, immensely aided by public co-operation and consent but ultimately backed by clear authority. This is the principle on which the Government is acting now.Clearly, it is to be hoped that such severe measures will limit the loss of life, the strain on health services and staff, and also produce a diminution in the spread of the virus. Yet it seems certain that Covid-19 will be present in the world and a danger to every country for longer than lockdown-type measures can be maintained. Decisions will need to be made about the rules we will live under for a sustained period – when the immediate crisis has moderated but the risk of its return is high.Those decisionsshould be guided by a second important principle. To paraphrase Jeremy Bentham: “the greatest liberty of the greatest number” is the goal governments should have in mind. Of course, many universal personal habits, such as handshaking and kissing, might have to change for some time. But as soon as medical research and technology make it possible, restrictions on the economy and society should be eased in favour of a more inidual focus on preventing contagion.This is where large-scale testing comes in. Ministers have spoken of the availability in the near future of tests for the antibodies that will show who has had the virus and enjoys some immunity to it. Those people should then be back at work and free to travel. More widely, rigorous testing for the virus itself, and the ruthless isolating of anyone suffering from it and tracking of all their recent contacts, need to become the norm once the pandemic is on a more manageable scale. This has been the approach of Singapore and South Korea, and it is better than long term constraints on the whole population.Finally, it is vital never to lose sight of a third principle: that in the long term, the creativity, innovation, fresh ideas and resilience of a free society will always prove to be the best foundations for the pursuit of health, prosperity and happiness, including a sustainable environment. In the late 1940s, after the trauma of war, ideas of state planning and the continuation of wartime controls were predominant in Britain and much of Europe. By 1951, the winning slogan of a returning Churchill was “Set the People Free”. In these dark days, that is an objective that must always remain our inspiration.UK coronavirus lockdown: what are the new rules for daily life?Coronavirus latest news: Police  besieged by public with calls over lockdown Can I walk my dog?

In the meantime, most customers can continue to make contactless payments for higher amounts using their smartphone.”By the end of the decade, coins and notes could account for just one in ten transactions, according to a Government-commissioned study published last month.This trend has accelerated since the outbreak of the coronavirus, with more businesses switching to “cash-free operations” at their sites amid hygiene concerns.Costa Coffee and Ted Baker are among the high street stores which have said they are going to start only accepting contactless payments.The World Health Organisation has yet to issue specific recommendations on the use of cash in relation to Covid-19.It has suggested, however, that bank notes can carry high levels of germs, posing a risk of infection more generally.According to research by the London politan University, £5 and £10 polymer notes already in circulation hold eight types of bacteria, including listeria, between them.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk lockdown rules coronavirus advice government","story":"Boris Johnson has placed the UK on a police-enforced lockdown with drastic new measures in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.The Prime Minister ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.But police chiefs warned of phone lines being inundated with calls with questions about what movements are still permitted, while MPs also called for answers.All non-essential shops are closing, excluded are food shops, pharmacies, corner shops, hardware stores, petrol stations, pet shops, post offices, banks, newsagents and shops inside hospitals.Parks will stay open, but gyms including outdoor gyms, play-parks, kiosks, all places of worship except for funerals will close.All gatherings of more than two people are going to be banned except for members of your own family. And these measures are in place for three weeks starting immediately.Police will have power to issue on the spot fines of £30 for meeting without good reason.The emergency piece of legislation is wide-ranging, and you can read it in its entirety below, but here are the key points: From Friday 20 March, schools and nurseries will be closed until further notice, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.But in order for key workers to get to work, schools had to remain open in order for their children to be cared for.The Government published a list of key workers in the early hours of Friday whose children will continue to be cared for at school amid the coronavirus pandemic.But there has been chaos in schools with beauticians and museum staff arriving claiming to be key workers while firefighters and microbiologists were turned away.The Prime Minister said that exams would not go ahead in May and June, meaning GCSEs, A-levels and SATs are on hold, but the aim is for children to get their results in the summer possibly using their predicted grades.Supermarkets up and down the country have seen scenes of apocalyptic panic buying (see video below).Britons have been told not to panic buy and shop as they would normally shop.But, people were ignoring the advice as queues snaked around supermarket car parks, so supermarkets have introduced rationing on grocery products. The hysteria has prompted some chains to introduce elderly and vulnerable-only shopping slots.Shoppers will also be limited to a maximum of three of any grocery product and a maximum of two on the most popular items such as toilet roll, soap and UHT milk.The Government has made assurances that shops\u0027 supplies will remain fully stocked and under the new emergency Coronavirus Bill, supermarkets would be forced to tell ministers about any supply chain issues.The Government has said that if people must leave their homes to purchase food, they should limit social contact with other people. Areas of close social contact such as pubs and clubs are high-risk areas for transmission of the virus. Ministers will be able to prohibit or restrict events and gatherings, and to close premises, if the public health situation deems it necessary the notes to the Bill say.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed quite a hefty emphasis on limiting smaller gatherings to counter the spread of the virus.Restaurants also fall into this category and a number of chains - including McDonald\u0027s, Costa Coffee and Nando\u0027s - who had been offering a take-away only service will closed their doors indefinitely ahead of the Prime Minister\u0027s Dozens of stations on the London Underground network have been closed following the outbreak of Covid-19.Transport for London says the plans were designed to allow critical workers to make essential journeys and will see up to 40 stations which do not interchange with other lines closed on the Tube network.Here is the full list of the closures: Buses in the capital will be reduced and people are being urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys and the Waterloo and City line and Night Tube services will not run from Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: I\u0027m urging Londoners to only use public transport for essential journeys. Everyone should follow this and the other advice to help keep themselves and each other safe.But this advice was not being adhered to, as the Tube, buses and trains were still packed on Monday morning, as can be seen below.TfL said it would also be gradually reducing the frequency of services across the network, to provide a service for critical workers to get to where they need to - ensuring that remaining services are not overcrowded.London Overground, TfL Rail, the DLR and London Trams will also be running fewer services from next week.Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Transport, has previously hinted railway services could be axed because there was no point running ghost trains.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the Government will underwrite the entire nation\u0027s wage bill. Anyone who cannot work because of the coronavirus pandemic will be paid 80 per cent of their salary by the Government, capped at £2,500 per month, under an unlimited rescue package unprecedented in the history of the British state.Mr Sunak also announced four major financial pledges. Government-backed loans worth £330billion - equivalent to 15 percent of GDP - will be made available to support businessesExtending the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality sector and funding grants of up to £25,000 for smaller businessesThree-month mortgage holiday, meaning those affected by coronavirus will not pay a penny towards their mortgageOn Tuesday, Mar 17, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British citizens were advised against non-essential foreign travel for 30 days.That refers to anywhere outside the UK.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Based on the fast-changing international circumstances today I am announcing changes to FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) travel advice.UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries.The FCO will always consider the safety and the security of British nationals so with immediate effect I\u0027ve taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally for an initial period of 30 days and of course subject to ongoing review.People classed as vulnerable have been told to drastically change the way they live their lives by social distancing. The Government is strongly advising them to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible.Those who fall into this category are: Underlying health issues can be largely defined by anyone who is instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds, according to the Department of Health.These conditions are set out in the box below.Pregnant women are the most recent group to be added to the list, although the Government has stressed this is purely a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.Although the limited evidence suggested there were no complications in pregnancy, for many infectious diseases there is a small but appreciable additional risk and as this was a new virus there was no evidence for people in early stages of pregnancy.Infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general and that is why we have taken the very precautionary measure while we try and find out more, the Government\u0027s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said, adding that he would rather be overly cautious at this stage and admit it was overkill at a later date than underplay it and get it wrong.Those considered extremely vulnerable have been told to shield themselves from society for 12 weeks. Around 1.5million people were written to to inform them they are part of this group and should not leave their homes until at least Monday, June 15.Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus.Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic, the Government said, and the advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.Anybody with coronavirus symptoms - a new, persistent cough or a fever - should self-isolate.Those living alone should do so for seven days, but those living with others should self-isolate as a household for 14 days. Where possible - this should mean not leaving the home at all, and getting groceries delivered to the property.Criminal trials are to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread of coronavirus.In a statement, it was announced that the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett - the most senior judge in England and Wales - has decided no new trial should start in any Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or fewer.As a result, cases longer than three days that were due to start before the end of April will be postponed.The announcement came after pressure mounted on the Government to make clear its strategy for courts, amid growing concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on court business.The statement said the impact of the public health emergency on the operation of the courts has been under constant review, and that criminal trials pose particular problems in a fast-moving situation because of the involvement of many participants including the judge, jurors, defendants, lawyers, witnesses and court staff.All cinemas and theatres are now closed.The move comes after theatres in the West End and around the UK closed.The Society Of London Theatre - which represents hundreds of theatres in the capital including the National Theatre, London Palladium and London Coliseum - and UK Theatre said the decision was not taken lightly.The Royal Shakespeare Company also announced its three theatres will close following the Government\u0027s advice.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/25/12/music-festival-stock.jpg","title":"bandcamp coronavirus musicians pay what you want music industry latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Music platform said it wanted to help support artists suffering financially amid the Covid-19 outbreakMusicians earnt more than $4m (£3.47m) via music platform Bandcamp in a single day, after the website pledged to donate 100 per cent of its revenue to artists.The initiative, which lasted all of Friday 20 March, followed reports of how the coronavirus has caused serious financial losses for thousands of people working in the music industry.The majority of gigs, tours and festivals that were scheduled to take place in the UK over the next three months have been cancelled or postponed.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis includes Eurovision Song Contest, The Great Escape Festival, and the 50 anniversary of Glastonbury Festival.Nick Cave says coronavirus means we need to live \u0027different lives\u0027Glastonbury 2020 cancelled due to coronavirusIn a statement acknowledging Friday’s success, Bandcamp said: “We want to thank everyone who joined us last Friday in supporting artists and raising awareness about the impact of Covid-19 on the music community.“The numbers tell a remarkable story: on a typical Friday, fans buy about 47,000 items on Bandcamp, but this past Friday, fans bought nearly 800,000, or $4.3 million worth of music and merch.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”More details will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”More details will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Developers would aim to allow organisations such as the UN\u0027s health agencies to share information more quickly, and to be able to speed up replies to commonly asked questions using tools such as automated responses.Facebook also said it would run an online hackathon with the aim of encouraging developers to build messaging solutions that address issues related to the coronavirus such as social distancing and access to accurate information. Participants would get special acess to Messenger tools and educational materials, Facebook said, and the winners will get mentors from the company to help them build their ideas.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That warning – which has been around for years – appears to be entirely fake, and there is no reason to worry about any such message.It also includes a common reminder about WhatsApp Gold, and urges anyone reading the message not to be taken in by scams promising it. For once, this message is not in itself a hoax: there really is a scam that promises WhatsApp Gold or WhatsApp Plus, and that is often used as a way to trick people into downloading malicious software or otherwise trick them into believing in scams.But the Pope message\u0026nbspthen also goes onto warn about another video, and urges people to pass it on.Please inform all contacts from your list not to open a video called the \u0027Dance of the Pope\u0027, a representative example reads. It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on BBC radio. Fwd this msg to as many as you can!The call to share the wording that comes\u0026nbspat the end appears to have worked, and the message has been passed quickly across WhatsApp and beyond.There has been no such announcement of any kind of virus on BBC radio. The rest of the message is so vague that it is impossible to know what it really refers to, but it does not appear to be linked to any real threat.Experts caution that users should\u0026nbspbe cautious about any files they receive over messaging apps, especially if they come from unknown people or have strange wording or names attached to them.

It causes hardship. It makes others panic.“Our nation’s history has been forged by people coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal,” says the Queen.She is absolutely right.Most ARE taking seriously their safety and other people’s.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over. Some household-name ­companies have not covered themselves with glory.EasyJet effectively abandoned passengers stuck in foreign parts with no way home until Sunak stuffed taxpayers’ cash down their throats.My we and I escaped from Cyprus last week on one of the last ­scheduled flights before hotels and airports were shut down.A lot of EasyJet over-s passengers feared being stranded with nowhere to stay.This crisis has hit Downing Street hard, with ministers and officials working -hour days, almost hot-bedding in No as they struggle to cope with fast-changing events.London, the UK epicentre of contagion, is in lockdown as the death toll spurts faster than tragic Italy’s at this stage of the spread. Did Boris get it right  We’ll soon know.It is interesting to observe the reaction of dferent age groups to this pandemic.Schoolchildren are understandably scared by the headlines. Old folk, some of them war babies, are more fatalistic.But some in their s and s are flagrantly ignoring advice to self-isolate.They are the least likely to die of this bug but risk putting thousands of fellow Brits in an early grave.A few months ago, the UK was split by what now seems a harmless spat over Brexit.There were Remainer black “jokes” that Britain would rejoin the EU once all we Brexit fogies had popped our clogs and the Eurosceptic virus had been eliminated.Covid- may be culling the elderly, but at least it’s impartial.They applaud their “friends” in Russia, China and others even more extreme who will take advantage of crippled Western economies, especially in Europe.Once we are through this pandemic, the next truly momentous battle will be between the West’s cash-strapped but creative “free spirits” and the authoritarian iron fists of the former Soviet era. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you have a fever, take paracetamol. If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs orin doubt, ask your doctor for advice.Tap to see where Covid- is near youFollowing this, the NHS are now urging people to stick to using paracetamol rather than ibuprofen.They say on their website: There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirusworse.But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you.Despite this, people who are already taking ibuprofen for other conditions should not stop without consulting a doctor.Both paracetamol and ibuprofen can bring a temperature down and help with flu-like symptoms.However, ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsare not suitable for everyone and can cause side-effects - especially for people with asthma, heart and circulatory problems.The NHS website previously recommended both paracetamol and ibuprofen, but has since changed its advice.There is also some evidence linking ibuprofen to more severe illness from other respiratory infections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Best of luck to everyone in the same boat this morning. #homeschool #day.”Fellow parent Melanie Williams joked: “ per cent attendance at today’s #homeschool and the welcome assembly was lovely.”But not all home lessons went smooth for the millions who had to look after their children while also working from home.Mum Samantha Nixon wrote: “Teachers deserve much more credit! I didn’t realise how much until I had to #homeschool my two children.”One parent asked “How are teachers not alcoholics ” while a stressed-out dad got his golf clubs out for a “PE lesson” with his son in the back garden.Another, Rori Fett, joked: “Day one of the schools closing and home-schooling beginning. Kids have been expelled and I’m taking early retirement. What time is wine o’clock ”James DeVaney added: “Anyone working from home with kids still think teachers are paid appropriately ”Naomi Seal posted: “Day  of homeschooling. We both cried before lunch.”Some schools offered online lessons for their pupils to follow at home, including Truro High, an independent establishment in Cornwall for girls.Headmistress Sarah Matthews said: “Our priority will be to ensure that the quality of learning does not change.“We do not simply want the girls to maintain their standards over the coming weeks and months. We want them to be stretched, to complete their curriculum coursework as planned and to continue to make excellent progress.”Despite millions staying at home after last week’s announcement by PM Boris Johnson, children of designated “key workers” are still allowed to go to school as normal. However school leaders said most parents had heeded advice from the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to send their children in onlyit was absolutely necessary. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, paid tribute to classroom staff for calmly adapting to the coronavirus crisis.He said: “Schools are reporting that the number of pupils arriving is manageable. We are grateful to parents for their understanding.“We would like to pay tribute to schools for their amazing work in organising this provision so quickly. They have calmly gone about the business of identying children who need places, arranging staffing cover, and providing learning resources for children who are at home. It has been an exemplary exercise in superb leadership.”Parents were also warned to remain vigilant to the dangers of their children spending more time online.Child safety online organisation Internet Matters said parents should check that their children’s devices have age-appropriate settings in place — and implement screen time limits as part of their new routine.Carolyn Bunting, the group’s chief executive, said: “As parents, we are all facing uncharted territory amid the coronavirus pandemic as we try to navigate work, schooling and our children’s well-being.“Tech provides many fantastic opportunities at this time, giving children additional tools to learn, create, socialise and a place to have their downtime. However, as a child’s screen time increases, so does their chances of facing online risks.”She warned: “It’s essential that parents do not become complacent about their child’s digital world and the harms they could be facing online, which could include everything from seeing inappropriate content to having unwanted contact from strangers.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t have enough tests for everyone and evenwe did, it would not change the way most people are treated.Q: If I suspect I have coronavirus, should I inform everyone I’ve been in close contact with  A: You only need to inform people who you have been in contact withyou have been admitted to hospital and are confident, via testing, that you have the virus.Q: Should I wear a mask, scarf or gloves to protect myself  A: Psychologically you may feel safer behind a mask or scarf but there is no evidence to suggest this stops the virus being spread. Many are suitable for dust and pollution but the virus particles are microscopic.In fact, some people might argue that you may touch your face moreyou are wearing a mask or scarf.If you use gloves on areas that could have become contaminated, such as an ATM or petrol pump, you will need to then throw those gloves away and this means you are going to get through an awful lot of gloves in one day.This is why it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water or use hand sanitiser with a minimum of  per cent alcohol when you are out and about. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" A: Yes and no. Our natural instinct is to hug or embrace our loved ones andyou are all at home together and no one is showing any symptoms you can carry on as ­normal.Butsomeone in the ­family is self-isolating you must keep a physical distance. The same goes for elderly relatives or those in the at-risk group. You must keep your distance from them evenyou are not showing signs of having the virus.Q: If I have symptoms that aren’t typical of coronavirus, such as a runny nose, sore throat, tickly cough and headache, could I still have the virus A: Of the , tests that have been carried out on people with symptoms that could be corona­virus, more than , have proved negative, so most people don’t have the virus but still need to isolate just in case.Q: Is it safe to take ibuprofen while you have coronavirus A: Ibuprofen is a commonly used medicine that can be bought over the counter. But it is also an anti-inflammatory, which works by stopping inflammation in the body. With this virus, we don’t want to do that.The best response to the virus is to produce inflammation so the body can fight it. So it is better not to take ibuprofen but to use paracetamol instead to help bring down your temperature.Q: Will vitamin C help my body to fight the virus A: In theory it supports the immune system and won’t do any harm, but there is no strong evidence that taking even large doses of vitamin C makes much dference with this virus.It is important to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet as well as taking a vitamin D supplement, which is always useful in winter anyway. It’s important to also get out in the garden or on your balcony to absorb a few rays of sunshine, without burning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: I have symptoms, but how do I self-isolate A: You need to stay indoors. If friends or family deliver food, they must leave it on the doorstep for you to bring in yourself. You will need to self-isolate for seven days.Butyou live with others, all members of your household will need to self-isolate for  days.You need to stay in your own room. You must eat your meals in that room and sleep alone. Use your own crockery and glassware and make sure you wash them up immediately after use. Clean hard surfaces after you have used them.Ideally you should use separate bathrooms. If you have to share a bathroom, you should use it last then wipe down surfaces with a bleach-based product. Use separate towels and toiletries.Keep a safe distance — a minimum of two metres — apart from other household members.Q: At what point should I seek medical advice A: If you are having breathing dficulties or chest pain which is getting worse, or your temperature is very high and not coming down with fluids and paracetamol, that is the time to seek further medical advice by phoning  or going on their website. If you are really breathless, phone  — but this is only for severe cases.Q: I have an outpatient appointment but should I avoid going to hospital A: If you don’t have symptoms and have an outpatient appointment, such as a scan, it is OK to go to hospital as long as you keep your distance from other people and leave the hospital as soon as your appointment is over.For those in the at-risk group, it is best to stay home. In both cases, contact your unit first and seek advice. If you have cancer, it is important to continue with treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and those units will be more conscious than ever to isolate those patients when they come in and to get their treatment done quickly so they can get home as soon as possible.Q: Which people are classed as at-risk A: These are people who are ­normally advised to have the seasonal flu jab. They include those with underlying medical conditions. These include:Q: And who is classed as being high risk A: People in the high-risk group include those who have had an organ transplant and are taking immunosuppressants, currently ­having treatment for cancer and people with conditions such as HIV.Q: Is is possible to get corona­virus twice A: Currently we don’t know enough about this virus to say for sure that you can’t get it twice but it is unlikely.If it turns out to be like seasonal flu it’s possible there might be another round of virus next winter, as we don’t know yet how strong people’s immunity will be.We will know more in the future and soon a test will become available to show whether someone has had the virus and has developed immunity.Tap to see where COVID- is near you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a former Cabinet minister is calling for Boris Johnson to go further by introducing a rewritten Bill in  monthsapos timethe powers are still deemed necessary. This afternoon MPs are gearing up to debate and sign off on strict measures that would grant ministers, councils, police, health professionals and coroners increased controls. Sweeping changes will include reducing the number of doctors required to sign off on sectioning those with mental health issues from two to one, while police would be given authority to force those infected with Covid- to self-isolate. Labour have welcomed the change but Shami Chakrabarti, the Shadow Attorney General said they would prefer even more frequent reviews. It came after David Davis, the ex-Brexit secretary, said six-monthly reviews were not sufficient to keep such wide-reaching legislation in check and predicted there were likely to be mistakes in the -plus pages of emergency legislation. Senior ministers are currently attempting to limit the peak number of infections to reduce pressure on the NHS. As of Sunday morning, there were , cases in the UK and  patients who had tested positive for coronavirus had died. Downing Street sources confirmed that the Government would introduce an amendment to the Coronavirus Bill on Monday to ensure the fresh powers within it had to be renewed every six months.

The announcement followed concern from some MPs that the extensive powers contained in the legislation could be in place for two years. But Mr Davis said he feared the current set of powers contained in the fast-tracked Bill would give the Government undue strengths which could infringe on civil liberties. His comments come after Labouraposs shadow equalities minister Naz Shah submitted an amendment, backed by  MPs, to exempt those from faith backgrounds from automatically being crematedthey die after contracting coronavirus.  There are anxieties, especially among Jews and Muslims whose faiths forbid cremation, that local authorities, in the event the number of deaths increase dramatically, will be able to use the emergency powers to disregard legal safeguards that currently prevent the cremation of human remains against the wishes of the deceased. Mr Davis said he was personally concerned that powers allowing the Government to postpone elections could be misused.  The civil liberties campaigner said: This Bill was put together in five days, it is -odd pages long. It is guaranteed, bluntly, that it will have mistakes and unnecessary elements to it. Those mistakes will all be in one direction and thataposs giving more power to the Government than is necessary. The senior Conservative MP said a six-month sunset clause would not go far enough in terms of checks. Whataposs going to happen is weaposre going to have another one-day debate and weaposre going to talk about the same  pages in six monthsapos time, he added. How is that going to work out  Are we going to amend the Bill  We canapost, thereaposs no scope to amend it. My view is very dferent - we accept it is going to be there for a year for safetyaposs sake and that gives you six to nine months to learn what has happened scientically, what has happened economically and what has happened on the social front. We may have no high street by then, no pubs left by then or very few. You just donapost know. The trick is to write it properly and present it nine months in so we can spend three months looking at it.

It has been clear to me that there are still too many people across our country who are being expected to, or expecting to, go to work as normal and this presents a serious and unnecessary risk of spreading the virus, the First Minister said. I want to reiterate thatyou run a business andthe nature of your business makes it dficult for you or your workers to work from home or to practise safe social distancing then you should close. A series of retailers have already announced they are closing their doors, including John Lewis and Primark. Itaposs understood the UK government is considering announcing the closure of all shops except supermarkets, food stores and pharmacies. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We set out steps on Friday in relation to those premises which we needed to shut in order to reduce social interaction.  But weaposve also said that we will continue to be guided by the science and by the medical advice, andthereaposs more that we need to do then we will do so. Concerns have been raised about the number of people taking the London Underground after the service was reduced. Several social media users posted images of busy London Underground lines, with commuters in close proximity despite Government pleas to practice social distancing. Some claimed there was little other option for those who needed to travel in for work, since a number of services had been reduced by Transport for London. Nurse Julia Harris tweeted pictures of queues and a packed carriage at North Greenwich tube station, where trains were running every seven minutes. She urged Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Boris Johnson to address the situation, adding: This is becoming dangerous for critical workers.There have also been questions about whether or not building sites should remain open. Yesterday Boris Johnson said: “We need to think about the kinds of measures that we’ve seen where, other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on people’s movements altogether,” Johnson said. The sht in language prompted the Construction Leadership Council to convene an emergency meeting later today on how long sites stay open for with BuildUK set to issue more guidance on what sites should be doing to stay open. It is hoped that further protections for the self employed might help more workers stay home.  Number  signalled that help may be coming, with officials working around the clock to find a well-targeted support package. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman told reporters on Monday morning: We understand the dficult position the self-employed are in. We have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps. We appreciate the urgency of the situation and officials are working around the clock to find a well-targeted support package. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced a package of support to help employers survive the coronavirus shutdown and continue to pay their staff. He said any employer in the country would be eligible for the coronavirus job retention scheme.  On further powers in lockdown, a Downing St spokesman said today: The Health Secretary set out the governmentaposs position. Our message is clear people should stay at homepossible.

Over , jumped, stretched and jogged on the spot while watching him live on his YouTube channel The Body Coach TV. The session was viewed a further . million times during the day. Wayne Rooney’s four children were among those who joined in the free -minute session. Joe, , told the Mirror: “I’ve been blown away by the response – I’m buzzing. I was about to do a UK tour of schools, teaching kids about exercise, but it was cancelled. “Late last week I was in bed think­­ing, ‘How can I reach all these kids  They’re going to need some help.’ I felt quite emotional about it. Then I came up with the idea of PE with Joe. “I’ve been working on ways to get kids healthier and more active for the past four years. It’s taken a pandemic and people being locked in their houses for everyone to realise that our kids being active is so important. “It’s essential for their physical and mental wellbeing.” He has also designed exercise programmes especially for older people. Joe thinks we can use our time in self-isolation to great advantage. He said: “I know we can pull together, be upbeat, motivated and inspired to get through this pandemic. “It’s possible to come out of this fitter and see the time as an opportunity to put healthy, portion-controlled food on tables because we’re not out and about having junk food.”He added: “Sitting on the sofa watching Netflix or endless news brings you down. Exercise breaks that and you’re going to feel fantastic. So we have to be positive, look up to the sky and remind ourselves that things are going to get better.”Joe, who films the workouts at home, revealed he does not take long to get himself ready for the camera.  He said: “When I go on TV, they chuck a bit of make-up on me. But when I’m at home, I roll out of bed and stick a T-shirt on, shorts and don’t bother with socks. “I was going to tie my hair back but then thought having a massive mop dancing all over the place might make a few kids laugh.” Joe has vowed to keep doing his PE lessons on all weekdays until schools reopen. And he hopes good habits will last a lot longer than the pandemic. He said: “I’ve been trying to create change for so long and I want schools not to neglect PE. “Bring daily exercise to the forefront of education because when you do that, you have really focused, happy, energetic kids who have a better attention span and feel more optimistic. “Exercise and eating healthily will change their lives. So I hope this will change the fitness education system for years to come.” Joe started online fitness advice five years ago and went on to sell a million books and land his own TV show.  He said that when he turned his attention to helping children, interest from telly bosses waned. But he refused to give up. Joe added: “I’ve been building it, self-funding a documentary on YouTube that nobody watched... Even when I did bootcamps and no one turned up, I kept going back. No one was watch­­ing my videos or engaging. But I had a voice in my head that said, ‘Keep going. Don’t worry what anyone thinks. You’re doing a good thing’.” He said people from around the world – including in Thailand and Iran – are now joining in. Joe, who lives in London with we Rosie Jones, their -month-old daughter Indie and three-month-old son Marley, uses little or no equipment in the workouts.

And while itaposs going to be very hard for the majority of people to find new jobs, there are some places that desperately need help right now.With people up and down the UK continuing to panic-buy items, despite being urged to shop responsibly, supermarket shelves are being cleared out at an astonishing rate and stores canapost keep up.So a number of supermarkets, from Lidl to Tesco are looking to hire temporary staff to help out at this dficult time.  A woman named Holly Maxwell recently discovered just how much of a need there is for supermarket employees after she managed to get a job in Tesco in a day. Holly, who previously spent four years working as a Commercial Sales Manager at Watford Football Club, was made redundant earlier this year.She had been struggling to find new work, when she noticed how bare the shelves were in her local Tesco. The young woman enquired as to whether they needed any help and soon found herself being ushered upstairs for an interview.  In a post on LinkedIn, Holly explained the process. She said: I askedthey had any jobs I got told interviews were taking placeI wanted to go upstairs. I sat for two hours without an appointment to be seen, I even drove back with all my paperwork the same day to get me signed up I didn’t even ask how much I was being paid. I started my induction and training yesterday on the tills, my first sht is tomorrow. She goes on to admit that she was initially embarrassed to be working at Tesco after having such a great position at a great organisation. However sheaposs now realised that in these challenging times, it really doesnapost matter how she earns money and sheaposs proud to be doing her bit to help. I am now temping but in my induction I met many people like me all ages out of work some closing their own business due to this virus and pride set aside they want to earn money in this dficult time, she continues. I feel terrible for thinking this way especially when I have family in this industry. I was going to keep it to myself, but I’ve come to realiseI’m earning money no matter what I do I’m winning at the end of the day especially with everything closing down and no clue when it will be back to normal! She added: I’m proud I put myself out there, I’m proud I’m starting a new skill and proud I am helping the economy in this dficult time!

The implants she selected were double the recommended size, which meant fat from her thighs, arms and stomach was drained to achieve the perfect size. She said: I had around cc bum implants which is double the size people normal have at first. I also gained four stone in weight so they could transfer the fat from my body to my bum but it was a huge mistake. It looks like Iaposm wearing a nappy now and I hate looking at it as it gives me awful anxiety.

Star is aiming to have the first part of the corrective surgery done in the UK, costing £, before travelling to Columbia later onion the year to undergo a fat transfer, costing an additional £,.  The second surgery involves having fat from her stomach put into her bum to create more rounded shape.She said: I would have booked this in straight away but due to coronavirus I will not be able to travel for months which is disappointing.I have been told by other doctors that my implants are resting on my spinal cord andthey were not removed that I could end up in a wheelchair for le.  Itaposs terrying but Iaposm hopeful Iaposll get it all sorted this year so I can feel happy about my appearance again. But, this wasnapost Staraposs first time under the kne.

Dannielle Luttrell from Hobart, Tasmania, has gone viral on social media after sharing her method for making bread in a slow cooker, reports Manchester Evening News.Her Facebook post has garnered over , likes, and hundreds of thousands of shares.

Hereaposs a look at what she uses:  cup warm water Two cups of warm milk Two Tbsp melted UNSALTED butter One to three tablespoons of sugarThree tablespoons of active dry yeastSix cups of whole wheat flourTwo teaspoons of salt One teaspoon of baking powderOnce sheaposs got all of this, she breaks the recipe down into three steps.  Step one Grab a big bowl and stir together the warm water, onetablespoons of sugar and three tablespoons of yeast. Wait for five minutes– it should be frothy on the top. While youaposre waiting warm two cups of milk and two tbsp of butter in microwave. Step two Add milk and butter to the yeast mixture. Using a standing mixer slowly add the six cups of flour, two teaspoons of salt and one teaspoon of baking powder. Mix together to form a dough and knead. Danielle explains she used a dough hook on her mixer once she had incorporated most of the flour to knead for about five minutes, then kneaded it by hand for another five to seven minutes. Step three Line slow cooker with baking paper and place in your round ball of dough. It will rise in the slow cooker as it heats through. Cook on high power for two to two and a half hours. Start checking at every seven to  minutes until top is sponge-y but springs back and no moisture on the top. The bottom should be a nice brown colour as well as sides.

The Palacio de Hielo skating rink at Madridaposs Ice Palace is to be used to house the dead before their bodies are buried or incinerated because of the saturation facing the city’s funeral parlours. The decision was reached following talks between Madrid’s regional government, Spanish army chiefs and city hall officials.Spain began its second week of a government-imposed lockdown with its worst coronavirus death toll in  hours -  people.Health chiefs confirmed , people with the virus have now died in Spain and the number of coronavirus sufferers in intensive care stands at , -  more than on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases nationwide was , at lunchtime on Monday. Madrid is the worst-affected part of Spain, with , deaths and , cases. The privately-run Ice Palace was closed as part of a government-ordered lockdown last week imposing restrictions on peoples’ movement and shutting restaurants, bars, theatres, cinema and other leisure complexes.  The popular attraction, normally open to the public from mid-September to the end of May, also has a -screen cinema,  bowling lanes and a shopping centre with restaurants. City council sources quoted by Spanish media said the temperature of the ice made it the ideal place to avoid victims’ bodies from decomposing amid the growing dficulties of the Spanish capital’s funeral parlours to deal with the increasing number of dead.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-gorbals-vampire-stalked-city-streets","story":"IT HAS gone down in history as one of the most spine-chilling moments in Glasgowrsquos ghoulish past."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-says-parks-not-full-says-dont-gather-weddings-celebrations","story":"The First Minister has hit out at those flocking to parks and beaches as she announcedthe government advice on preventing the spread of coronavirus is \"not optional\"."},{"url":null,"title":"janice-bell-pans-people-pussycat-dolls","story":"LAST weekend eight of us descended on Arran for a girlsrsquo weekend.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Chocolate-box we arenrsquot. All around are plots so lush and well-tended they could be entered at Cha. Our patch is not in their league. Looking out to hills at the back, it opens onto a field, where sheep huddle at night under a blackthorn by our gate, leaving wisps of wool every morning. Chicken wire intended to keep out rabbits has been gnawed by marauders for whom our mossy, tufty grass is irresistible. Nor can we grow a dense hedge to discourage them because, wersquove been told, the horses who share the field with the sheep would bring our wooden fence crashing down as they leaned over to munch it. And needless to say, nothing can keep out the nettles, which wave wildly at me after itrsquos been raining, like kids on a school bus.Burying myself in a rose catalogue is a definition of day-dreaming. The David Austin Handbook of Roses, gted by a green-fingered friend, is jam-packed with temptation. One of the delights of summer is to be taken around this friendrsquos delectable garden. A riot of sweet peas, foxgloves and hollyhocks, with soaring old trees casting welcome shade, its walls are swagged with clematis and honeysuckle. Thanks to her, I now go to sleep in the company of roses called Roald Dahl, Tam OrsquoShanter or The Pilgrim, after the Canterbury Tales. Therersquos Gabriel Oak, hero of Thomas Hardyrsquos Far from the Madding Crowd, or the mercurial Eustacia Vye, from The Return of the Native. Planted together, would they get on or would the results be another tragedy  I seem to remember Darcey Bussell was once askedshe would rather be given a damehood or have a rose named after her. She now has both.Vita Sackville-West was a self-confessed sucker for catalogues. The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach. The New Yorker writer Katharine S White was a devoted gardener at her Maine farmhouse where she lived with her husband, E B White. I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did Glasgow-set drama The Nest get off to a flying start ","story":"FORGET about the column inches Michelle Mone has racked up, or the seat in the House of Lords.

Nobody could have predicted the scale of the devastation, both socially and economically, wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. With large swathes of the economy essentially forced to shut up shop for months - and faced by the quick and unied action of the trade unions - Mr Sunak was left with little alternative but to make this unprecedented intervention, the like of which was not even seen in wartime, and which will almost certainly end up dwarfing the bank bailout of  by comparison.By forcing the Conservative government into a corner on this state intervention, the pandemic has also forced them to admit some truths that many would rather stayed hidden. Large-scale borrowing is possible. Citizens can be bailed out, not just banks and business. There can be support when things go wrong. Therersquos always been enough to go round.These are truths that have long been scoffed at when those on the left tried to highlight them - most recently Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour Party in last yearrsquos General Election which, unbelievably, took place just three months ago. Plans for wide-ranging nationalisation, the abolishment of tuition fees and free broadband for all were made a laughing stock of by opposition politicians and establishment media alike, whose taunting most often took some form of the question ldquohow are you going to pay for that Many will remember the BBCrsquos Emma Barnett mockingly asking Angela Raynerthe party wanted to nationalise sausages it wasnrsquot necessary for the Conservative Chancellor to specically mention meat-based products in last weekrsquos announcement when he essentially nationalised almost every industry in the country in one quick sweep.When former prime minister Theresa May infamously remarked that ldquothere isnrsquot a magic money tree we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want, it was in response to a nurse whose pay had been frozen for eight years and who was struggling to survive on her wage. If it seemed callous at the time, it seems unthinkable in the current moment. Not only does the magic money tree exist, underpaid nurses and their like should be first in line to shake it.Because while Mr Sunak deserves few platitudes for doing the only thing possible and conscionable under current circumstances, he will surely be credited with changing politics forever. Now wersquove seen that money can be borrowed to help those in need, how can we ever justy leaving people homeless on the streets  Now we know therersquos no limit on the cost of state intervention, why should anyone struggling ever have to pay for childcare  When itrsquos clear that political will is all that stands between poverty and the spending of trillions of pounds, how can we ever look at a foodbank again The genie is out of the bottle: the free market is not infallible or inevitable ending inequality is possible. Things can never be the same again.Of course, this is not the utopia that any on the left would wish for. Short-term crisis response is not an ideology, and nor is the maintained concentration of the levers of power with a small group of politicians socialism. But the scale of intervention pledged by Sunak cannot be overstated or removed from its context in history: in the UK, in our letimes and beyond, we have never seen the likes of it.Coronavirus has already put immense strain on the worldrsquos citizens and the global economy, with far worse expected to come.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you donrsquot follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.To ensure compliance with the Governmentrsquos instruction to stay at home, we will immediately:*close all shops selling non-essential goods,# including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship*we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public ndash excluding people you live with* and wersquoll stop all social events#, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this.I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to peoplersquos lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.And thatrsquos why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to.But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with  former clinicians now coming back to the service.With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.We are accelerating our search for treatments.We are pioneering work on a vaccine.And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus.Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted.Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together.To halt the spread of this disease.To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.And I know that as they have in the past so many times.The people of this country will rise to that challenge.And we will come through it stronger than ever.We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.Thank you."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11187054.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-research-reveals-mindfulness-key-golf-success","story":"And many believe a huge part of being able to truly get to grips with golf goes on between the ears.Now new Scottish research reveals how crucial psychology is in being able to boost performance, through the evidence of top players.Eight of Scotlandrsquos top male players have revealed the secrets of their success and what goes on in their minds before and after that big shot during professional competitions.In the first study of its kind in Scotland, lead researcher Alex Oliver, a sport and exercise PhD student at Glasgow Caledonian Universitys psychology department, looked at how golfers control their attention, which is vital for successful skill execution.Mr Olivers advice to sportspeople looking to boost performance would be: ldquoDonrsquot force it because thatrsquos when your performance can unravel.\"The research found that the establishment of a pre-shot and post-shot routine helped to offset distractions and is \"beneficial\" to concentration in competition.It also highlights the importance of \"mindfulness training\" to be able to deal with the disappointment of that duffed shot.One golfer explained: \"I drum it into the youngsters coming through because they are the ones that will tell their pals, oh am level after six holes, this is my best-ever after nine. Next think you screw it up on the back nine because youre score orientated. So I think your focus, your attention, has got to be on as much as you can, just on the task at hand, which is the next shot.\"Alex said his research ldquohelps us understand what concentration looks like in sport and what golfers need to do to concentrate.They all use mental tricks to concentrate and stop bad shots having a negative impact on their score.

At some point that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.Sources have already told The Herald that Mr Salmond is set to instruct his trial lawyers, Levy  McRae, to take legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of the complaints against him.Now the trial has finished, some of what he wanted led in court can be reported for the first time.At a preliminary hearing in January, the defence Mr Salmond hoped to use was laid out by his QC, Gordon Jackson, before trial judge Lady Dorrian.As Mr Salmond sat in the dock, Mr Jackson went through the lines of questioning he wanted to take with female complainers in the case, a standard legal step given the sensitivity involved in questioning them.Mr Jackson said it was a ldquovery unusual case from a ldquopolitical bubble.At its heart was the Scottish Governmentrsquos botched in-house investigation into two complaints of sexual misconduct against Mr Salmond when he was First Minister.After news of the investigation leaked in August , Mr Salmond launched a judicial review into how the Scottish Government ran this investigation.On  January , Mr Salmond won the review after ministers admitted it had been flawed from the outset.Because the investigating official had been in prior contact with the two complainers, the whole process was deemed to have been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias.Mr Salmond claimed at the time there had been a conspiracy. ldquoSome people are very clearly very anxious to remove me now as a political threat, which is why this is probably not over, he said.Mr Salmondrsquos legal team intended to claim this humiliation for Ms Sturgeonrsquos government spurred a coordinated campaign to discredit him.At the preliminary hearing, Mr Jackson estimated the ldquoshambles had cost taxpayers up to pound million in legal fees.He said people working in the Government, deeply unhappy at the judicial review outcome, therefore ldquoturned their attention very directly to the criminal process.These people ldquowith a clear motivation sought to influence that process in order to discredit the former First Minister, Mr Jackson said.He said there was a ldquoconcerted effort made by people within the Government to advance the criminal process ldquoas best they could.He said people who did not want to be part of a criminal inquiry, or did not think any crime had been committed against them, or want to complain, were ldquoencouraged to complain.He said the ldquoprime mover was one of the complainers in the indictment.At a further hearing in Glasgow in February, Mr Jackson also quoted a text message from one complainer to an SNP employee: ldquoJeez, think [a complainer] is in trouble. [Salmond] isnrsquot going to stop until he gets her and hersquos bringing down Nicola on the way.After considering Mr Jacksonrsquos proposed questioning, Lady Dorrian disallowed much of it and the judicial review barely featured in the trial.His legal team constrained, Mr Salmond pushed the conspiracy theory when giving his own evidence, saying some allegations were ldquodeliberate fabrications for a political purpose, while others were ldquoexaggerations.Besides Mr Salmondrsquos desire for revenge, Ms Sturgeon also faces two crucial inquiries into her conduct related to the judicial review.After the Governmentrsquos case collapsed in , Ms Sturgeon insisted that she had, rightly, not known about the in-house probe taking place.She said Mr Salmond had informed her about it himself when he visited her Glasgow home in April .She told MSPs the meeting had been a purely ldquoparty matter, not a government one, and so there was no need to have officials present or to report it to her private office ndash a potential breach of the ministerial code which will now be investigated.However, at the trial, Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, who brokered the meeting, said he met Ms Sturgeon in her Holyrood office a few days earlier, something she has never revealed.A Holyrood committee inquiry set up after the review will want to knowMs Sturgeon misled Parliament.Ms Sturgeonrsquos husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, is also facing calls from Mr Salmondrsquos outriders for an inquiry into how the party handled complaints against the former leader.

Lord Actonrsquos line about what absolute power tends to do corresponds far more to the normal pattern.Despite that, therersquos a surprising level of idiotic approvalof quite despotic powers, from people who will tell you that ldquothere are no libertarians in an epidemic or that, whenever we face a crisis, the measures that we turn to are basically socialism in action. The objection of the Prime Ministerrsquos critics is not so much to sweeping powers, but the fact that hersquos the one who gets to employ them.Exceptional measures are either necessary or not, and whether you approve of the current governmentrsquos other policies doesnrsquot come into that. If, when the exceptional circumstances have passed, such powers ought to be rescinded, itrsquos because they offer too much power to the government of the day mdash and they do so whatever its political colour.As it happens, we might just as easily learn the opposite lesson from what has happened in response to the pandemic. Some of the action to help us deal with the situation has been a matter of relaxing regulation mdash for example, allowing restaurants and bars to work on a delivery and takeaway basis without applying for a dferent licence, recognising the qualications of retired medical professionals, or paring back the bureaucracy around, to take only a few examples, sick leave, council powers over care duties, death certicates, tax credits, freelance tax s, VAT payments and housing benefit.At a more informal level, too, itrsquos already apparent that some things which have been considered normal practice are less than vital: commuting and face-to-face meetings turn out not to be necessary to many industries, which may even be more productive without them. And despite the irresponsibility of panic buyers, even parts of the economy that cannot be conducted remotely, such as the food supply chain, seem fairly resilient and adaptable.When the time comes to challenge police powers to shut down public gatherings, or other examples of what would normally be overreach, but most of us concede are currently essential, we may also want to consider whether those regulations that were quickly and easily dropped to cope with the crisis were all that useful in the first place.There is a danger of seeing the coronavirus crisis as a way of vindicating all sorts of changes that happen to correspond with the political priorities you already hold. Irsquove seen arguments that it proves the case for almost any hobby-horse: universal basic income, nationalising the railways, increasing teachersrsquo pay, abolishing zero-hours contracts, introducing bans on vaping and junk food and, inevitably, stopping Brexit.We will not be able to know what mistakes have been madein dealing with this pandemic until we have the benefit of hindsight. Nor is it likely that current predictions of quite how the world will change as a result of it are going to be accurate mdash evenwe assume that the world will almost certainly be changed by it.Butwe accept ndash as most responsible people now do mdash that strange and dangerous times justy extreme measures, and demand sacrices and altruistic responses from each of us, then it is because we understand that the circumstances are unprecedented. When we get back to normal, whatever the new normal turns out to be, we must insist that our laws and freedoms do as well.Read more: New figures confirm four more deaths as a result of pandemic"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-many-cooks","story":"GORDON Ramsey was visited by Gino DrsquoAcampo and Fred Sirieix, when the three catering celebs filmed a TV show.

There are inidual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbours.Let me be clear, I disagreed with Mrs Thatcher at the time and I still do, perhaps even more profoundly, having lived not just through her administration, but witnessed the carnage perpetrated by neo-liberalismover the last - years. Sentiments such as Mrs Thatcherrsquos have informed the development of society that we have created over this time. The self-centred reaction of many to the current situation is merely one manestation of this.It is revealed in studies such as Geert Hofstedersquos, who found in a global study that the UK had one of the highest scores for inidualist attitudes, ldquobeaten only by some of the commonwealth countries it spawned i.e. Australia and the USA. If we value the inidual more than the collective ndash or dare I say society ndash can we be surprised that when the shops open there is a queue of iniduals outside supermarkets, looking to buy what they, as iniduals consider they need, whether as iniduals or for their own immediate family And of course, this is how free markets work ndash we all pursue our own inidual self-interest. One consequence of the endorsement of this is that the UK is one of the most unequal societies in the world on almost any metric. Our country is what six per cent of the worldrsquos millionaires call home, yet one of our fastest-growing ldquoactivities is food banks. ldquoOur top one per cent earned a  per cent share of income in , while in Belgium the same calculation was seven per cent, and eight per cent in Norway and Sweden. This degree of inequality is not inevitable, but a political choice, and we elected them!When our concern about our fellow community members is so limited, how surprised should we be about the conduct of some in the present circumstances  This is the society we have spawned. As ye sow, so shall ye reap.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE coronavirus crisis has brought out the best and worst in society. It is heartening that the former predominates in our community.However, sadly there are sectors where this is not the case and we see opportunistic operators taking advantage to generate profits which are at best questionable. I refer in particular to the short-selling of shares by hedge funds against a background of plummeting global markets as a consequence of the Covid- pandemic.Short-selling is the process by which shares are borrowed by hedge funds from large financial institutions and immediately sold, taking the view that the market will fall before they have to be re-purchased and ed to the rightful owner. The dference between the original sale price and the ultimate buy-back price in a falling market represents the hedge fund profit. It does not take a Philadelphia lawyer to conclude in crisis-hit markets there are easy profits to be made. Consider, for example, shares in airlines with planes grounded, cruise companies with ships confined to harbour or travel companies with tourism virtually banned.Investment is defined as the placing of money with a view to profit. Short-selling conflicts with that in that hedge funds are dealing in assets shares which they do not own. The very act of selling large tranches of shares adversely affects and forces down prices and by extension the value of pension fund portfolios in which ultimately we all have an interest.This has been recognised in Spain and Italy where short-selling has been banned. The question has to be asked why no such action has been taken by the regulator in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority, as regards quoted shares here.It is entirely predictable that in the weeks and months ahead we shall be hearing of exceptional profits earned by hedge funds. At whose cost D Lindsay Walker , Strachur.FOR about the third weekend in a row, the supermarkets in my part of the world have had a fair portion of their shelves left empty, and I have had to mentally adjust my menus for the week. At the same time, the newspapers and the TV news carries pictures of shoppers queueing with large trolleys prior to first light at supermarkets and discount warehouses.Obviously, a proportion of those waiting, particularly at the warehouses, will be corner shopkeepers, looking to replenish their stock. However, the majority appear to be ordinary members of the public, who despite exhortations from the Government and supermarkets, insist on descending like a swarm of locusts.Ive been wondering: is it the same people who have been repeatedly panic buying, or is there a system which allocates a place in the queue at certain times, so dferent folk have been in the line  If so, when will it be my turn Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.TODAY, on my th birthday, some despicable person stole our early-morning milk delivery from outside the main door of our block of flats in Bearsden.What was to be a very limited celebration has been ruined by the kind of selfish behaviour which has been much in evidence during past weeks.Donald Mackinnon, Bearsden.THE owners of any public house or hotel which has stayed open during this crisis against the guidance and put lives at risk just for their profit should be deemed an unfit person to hold a liquor licence. At their next renewal these facts should be presented to the licensing board who will then permanently remove their licence. With many people putting their lives at risk to maintain essential services the last thing we need are idiots who simply dont care and create a bigger workload.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.AFTER reading Mark Smiths articlethis thought occurred to me.My husband and Ihave been in the habit of walking at least three times a week in several of our beautul parks, and afterwards we have enjoyed a cup of coffee at one of the coffee shops on the south side of Glasgow. Many of these are owned by the self-employed.I believe that many pensioners are sitting at home wondering what they can do to help in our current situation. Of course,being at home means less expenditure in many cases. I propose that those who can afford itgive the cost of their cups of coffee and perhaps a wee scone into a fund to help the self-employed at this particular time.Maybe the BBC or some other organisation could help with an effort along the lines of the Children in Need programme where money is donated. If this is not feasible the money could go to a bonus for the NHS staff to show our gratitude when this is all over.Josephine Stewart, Newton Mearns.Read more: Scotland essentially already in lockdown as businesses told to close"},{"url":null,"title":"jeanne-freemans-coronavirus-advice-right---not-exceptional","story":"That, in order to effect real and vital change in the world, you could just sit on your behind, let your blubber settle and do absolutely diddly squat all.Imagine no longer! Your country needs you to be as lazy as humanly possible.Just... stay in your house. Covid- can only be quashedwe self-isolate and socially distance ourselves.And yet, and yet. People still seem incapable of taking the advice fully on board.At the weekend we saw city dwellers flocking to the countryside to take advantage of the lovely weather, and to hang with any germs they might be carrying with them to the remoter parts of the country.There were umpteen social media posts from those who just couldnt bear the pubs being shut on a Friday night and so went to hotels to drink at their bars, and never mind about the bar staff who had to serve them or the housekeeping staff who had to clean up after them.Snowdoniarsquos National Park Authority announced yesterday it has closed its main carparks ldquofollowing the busiest visitor weekend in living memory.The sunshine was part of the problem. Here weve been stuck indoors over a long and storm laden winter. Now, finally, the weather has turned and we had two beautul, crisp, sunny days to play with.Yet we werent meant to play with them. We were meant to stand at the window and gaze out at them, forlornly.The government advice is that a walk outside is good for you so, like others and understandably, I tried on Sunday to go for a walk. The park was hoaching with people and keeping a solid two metre distance was not possible so I ed home.Thats part of the problem with social distancing - it only workseveryone gets on board. If some of us are weaving about and leaping out of the way like Jumping Frenchmen of Maine while others wander blindly in our path, its not effective.The messages from the English and Scottish governments is also conflicting. Late on Saturday night - far too late - Boris Johnson advised that people should not visit their mums for Mothers Day. Stay put, he advised.Scotlands National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, who is excellent, calm, measured and clear, gave his three-step advice for Mothers Day. Dont visit, he said, or try to have a video all with mum. Butyou do visit then wash your hands, have mum wash her hands, and stay two metres away from each other.The upshot was everyone translating the advice dferently - some insisting you cant visit your mother at all, others saying it would be fine.On Friday night Mr Leitch appeared on BBC Scotlands The Nine and said visiting the hairdressers was fine, as salons tend to be one of the more sanitary places you can visit. On Monday Nicola Sturgeon said hair salons should close.The messaging is not straightforward. \"Social distancing\" is relatively meaningless. I saw a great tweet asking why the messaging isnt \"the two metre rule\" - much easier to grasp.What really is easy to grasp, though, is that we should stay at home unless for vital journeys or a bit of solo exercise. All  is paused for now.If you have symptoms and live with other people then  days at home and dont cross the doorstep. Ive come across people who have symptoms and are going out and about as usual. That is unconscionable. Why are they doing it  Because they dont think the rules apply to them and, while they have symptoms, they dont believe them to really be Covid-.Its really moot, for the purposes of the behaviour of the general public, whether its Covid- or not. This is not the time for self-diagnosis or taking chances because you believe yourself to be the exception to the rule.Jeane Freeman MSP put it beautully: \"You are neither an exception nor exceptional.\"This is not the time for bending the rules to suit your bespoke and special circumstances. This is the time for knuckling down and doing exactly whats asked. If you have symptoms and you go outside then your actions could be responsible for a death. Being stuck indoors when the sun is shining is rubbish. Is it worth making other people gravely ill The advice to just stay in your house is more dficult when you live with people you dont particularly like or you have flatmates who are a pain in the behind. Its frightening advice when you live with someone who is abusive.But for the majority of us it just means a prolonged spell of slight tedium, perhaps with some whining weans wed like a break from. In the absolute grand scheme of things, this is not a terrible situation to be in.Stay home and fewer people will die.

However, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the CDCrsquos system was not designed to test for and track a widespread outbreak, which he characterised as ldquoa failing.In interviews with AP, two federal health officials with direct knowledge of the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said CDC experts did not know why many of the agencyrsquos test kits failed to reliably detect the virus.Stephen Morrison, a health policy expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, called the testing issues a ldquodebacle, contributing to what he described as a confused and delayed federal response to the crisis.As a result, he said, the CDC had now been marginalised within the White House, which observers feel is a worrisome development.ldquoCDC has generally been regarded as the best in the game, Mr Morrison said.ldquoI donrsquot think they anticipated the technical dficulty, or the speed with which the virus has been moving.

We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom.

More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test.

May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!.

Backing the measures, the First Minister tweeted: We need to follow this advice to save lives and protect our hospitals. People should stay in unless it#s essential to go out. It won#t be easy but it#s for the best.Johnson detailed a short list of reasons why iniduals can leave their homes as he ordered the immediate closure of all shops selling non-essentials. He ordered people to only leave the house to shop for basic necessities as infrequently as possible and to perform one form of exercise a day. Or they could seek medical help, provide care to a vulnerable person or travel to workabsolutely necessary, he said in a televised address. That#s all - these are the only reasons you should leave your home, he said. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say #no#. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. If you don#t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure people follow the rules, Mr Johnson ordered the immediate closure of non-essential stores including those selling electronics and clothing. All public gatherings of more than two people - other than those you live with - will be barred, the PM said. Other premises being shuttered are libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship. And while parks will remain open for exercise, all social events including weddings and baptisms will be stopped. Funerals, however, can continue. The Prime Minister acknowledged the move would disrupt people#s lives, businesses and jobs. I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review, he said. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. He said that no Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this as he reminded the public of the support programme to aid ailing businesses and struggling iniduals. But he said the drastic new measures allowing people to only leave home for the very limited purposes were necessary to slow the spread of the disease. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well, he added. Mr Johnson had been facing widespread calls to impose tough restrictions on the nation amid concerns people are ignoring social distancing advice. His call came after the UK death toll hit  and British citizens travelling abroad were told tohome while you still can. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the Prime Minister had called it right. We fully endorse his call for people to stay at home and to obey these restrictions - it is the only way we can reduce the pressure on the NHS and to save lives, he said.But he admitted: This will be very tough on non-food retailers and their staff as they close their doors. We are working with the Executive to establish the Covid- grant support scheme, further rate relief and other measures to support local independent retailers in the next few months.In an earlier escalation of advice, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told citizens travelling overseas toto the UK using commercial routes that are still running. If you are on holiday abroad the time to come home is now while you still can, he said. Foreign Office staff were working to help citizens get back where routes have been halted due to the growing crisis. Meanwhile, MPs were debating emergency legislation that could see airports shut and police having the powers to force people with virus symptoms to isolate. And, where, WHO general director Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said the pandemic is accelerating as he urged nations to impose more stringent measures than social distancing advice. To win, we need to attack the coronavirus with aggressive and targeted tactics - testing every suspected Covid- case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and tracing and quarantining every close contact, he said. Over the weekend crowds of people were witnessed visiting open spaces across many parts of the UK, at times flouting official social distancing advice. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier called those who disregarded the advice very selfish as he discussed measures to support NHS workers. He told BBC Radio  that he hoped testing of medical staff for Covid- would take place as soon as possible. And he said the Government has confirmed that all major hospitals have received deliveries of personal protective equipment needed by front line staff and that a hotline has been set up for NHS workers to ringthere are shortages in their area. Mr Hancock also said that , ventilators are now available after last week#s appeal by the PM, up from , that the NHS had access to previously. The severe measures came as Wendy Jacobs, a head teacher at Roose Primary School in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, died after testing positive for coronavirus.There were growing fears that Britain is on a similar trajectory to Italy - scene of the world#s worst outbreak - where the death toll passed , over the weekend. The Italian Government was one of a number of European countries to announce new or extended restrictions, with Germany banning public gatherings of more than two people not from the same household.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At St Anne#s Square, home to the MAC theatre, a hotel, a gym and many restaurants, padlocks are on gates and signs inform of closure because of the threat of Covid-.

The darkness won#t last hopefully for too long and I#m going to make Belfast bright again.I intend to spend quite a bit of money and make it a spectacular street, for the tourists who will come back and for the hotels and the taxi drivers.The taxi drivers say, #Fair play to him, he does all the murals free, he does the lights#.

Rev Tom McKnight, the Methodist President-elect and minister of Donaghadee Methodist Church, said that they did not have the technical services to stream, and because he felt most of his parishioners did not have the social media experience for streaming, he made sure that everyone received a #Worship at Home# sheet produced by the British Methodist Church.However, he watched a streamed service from Mountpottinger Methodist Church, his previous posting.

The UCD QUB research paper, called #Symbols and Labels: children#s awareness of social categories in a ided society#, is published in the Journal of Community Psychology.Speaking to the Belfastlast night, lead researcher Dr Laura K Taylor said: How and when children develop an understanding of group boundaries has implications for conflict resolution.She hoped the research would inform education policy and teaching in Northern Ireland.Our research is trying to help understand what it means for children to grow up in a post-accord society. Children today did not grow up in a violent society, so how do they learn about it These findings suggest that, by late childhood, children in Northern Ireland can readily identy and associate symbols with their hypothesised social categories.Separate school systems, as well as strong family networks and homogeneous lestyles, shape children#s cultural awareness, the researchers suggest.The UCD QUB research echoes a  study for the Community Relations Council, which found children as young as three were able to recognise symbols as being linked to either loyalist or nationalist cultures.That earlier study - carried out by the University of Ulster - found that by the age of six, % of the more than three hundred children surveyed could identy flags and parades as belonging to one #side# or the other.

I think she would#ve preferred a more secure occupation, Holly said.Now a regular on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Holly praised Kim online after opting to stay in England with husband, Co Armagh broadcaster Connor Phillips, due to the coronavirus.Dates like Mother#s Day are always dficult as it#s a reminder that we can#t just pop round to see our family when we want to! I always make sure the card arrives on time, though... I wouldn#t hear the end of it otherwise!Although my parents are both healthy and in their s, it#s so important to take every possible precaution, she said.It#s about maintaining the spread and not being anywhere we don#t have to be.Asked what traits she inherited from the former journalist, Holly joked she missed out on her physique.We#re both quite stubborn, enjoy a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and are never wrong, she said.People say we look alike, but sadly I didn#t get her legs!Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and Rossa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and RossaProving that boxers are more than just a tough exterior, Belfast sportsman Carl Frampton hailed his we for all she does for their family.Carlshares Carlaand Rossawith Christine , who he wed in .Alongside a holiday snap with his brood, the former two-weight world champion wrote: Happy Mother#s Day to the mother of our kids.

While she usually pens her bestselling thrillers in an office at her mum#s house, the former journalist said that she is now missing her company. I do feel a little asmy right arm has been chopped off, Claire said. That helps keep it all in perspective, I suppose. If it#s hard not to see her for a few days or weeks, it would be unbearable to not have her in my le anymore. She is particularly susceptible to the virus and it could have devastating consequences for her. So as hard as this is for all of us, it#s so important we do all we can to ensure she is kept safe.Mum is still relatively young, I want her to be around for a lot, lot longer!Claire credits Karen for passing on her sense of fun, her caring nature and for teaching her to be a good listener.For many of us, Sunday was a chance to shower our mums with love and flowers, but for some it brings a painful longing for the women who are no longer with us.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaniel Baker and his late mother Edna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaniel Baker and his late mother EdnaJust eight months after losing his own mother, Belfast Lord Mayor Daniel Baker said he would love nothing more than to show her his appreciation.The Sinn Fein councillor took up the role of First Citizen last December.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We can still go out when we need to for groceries and the like, so there is no need to panic. Why not take the opportunity to binge on a few Netflix series . Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep adults enthralled for sure. The Stranger Probably the top trending Netflix series so far this year and for good reason. Harlen Cobens latest creation shows a strange woman turn up in a British community to reveal the secrets of the inhabitants. The resultant human wrangling and mystery makes this one of those series where one more episode is never enough. The tying of those secrets together as the series unfolds reveals a lot more about the locals than they care to admit and uncovers a murky underbelly. This is a must-watch. googletag.cmd.push Marcella Anna Friel is exceptional in this Nordic-inspired British crime drama. She plays a run-ragged detective who finds herself central to the murder mysteries shes investigating. The edge-of-the-seat drama entailed in the unravelling of the story in each of the two stories is truly gripping. This is a well-acted and produced ITV drama that might have slipped under the radar for many. With two series and  episodes available on Netflix, there is plenty to binge on. Unforgotten Another ITV production starring the brilliant Nicola Walker. This series sees a team of detectives re-opening cold cases following the discovery of new information. They endeavour to reach back in time and across generations to dig up old evidence and connections. The result is another brilliantly gripping drama with a new story taking centre stage in each of the two series available on Netflix. It is fast-paced and written in a way that puts you in the investigation room, often shouting at the TV with nuggets of information youve spotted in previous episodes. A third series has aired but has not yet reached the streaming service. googletag.cmd.push Safe Another Harlen Coben creation which has seen an increase in traffic since the success of The Stranger, although Safe appeared on Netflix first last year. Coben specialises in writing a big story within the context of a small community and this is the ultimate example. A teenage girl goes missing from her home in a gated community, and her fathers desperate search brings him into a dark world. Suspicion falls on almost everyone and this series will have you second-guessing every word out of every characters mouth. The Trials Of Gabriel Fernandez This true-crime documentary is perhaps the most disturbing of these suggestions but is compelling viewing. It charts the story of nine-year-old Gabriel Fernandez and his gruesome death at the hands of his mother and her partner. The abuse he suffered sparks a wide-ranging investigation. That investigation and this series shines a light on something far more sinister and systematic than the abuse in Gabriels own home. It will make you feel very uneasy but you will not be able to stop watching, wide-eyed with shock.

At Home … We all love being at home, love the homes we have made, love being with our children and families.But to be restricted to being at home can be dficult, to be advised to stay at home and have our normal routine change can be stressful as we wonder how best to manage and live as normal.So here are a few ideas to help keep you sane, to still enjoy your days and be positive …Working at home  Is dficult at the best of times as the washing calls to be put on the line, the dog looks adoringly at you for a walk, the sun and garden beckon etc.But now with your children off too it’s about to get even harder, with demands for play, shouts of I’m bored, he took my doll, she keeps standing in front of the TV.So why not set up a new routine, plan your day to incorporate activities with the children and work time too.Yes you may have to work later than . pm as you’ll be doing less during usual office hours but at least you will get work done.Do explain that you do have to work, and then try activities with them for an hour and then work for an hour, or set up tasks and play activities they can do themselves play dough, creation station, jigsaws, a video about the natural world etc.If you have little ones at home, those under three years, it’s even harder but maybe your teenagers could help If not then you’ll have to adapt the routine to maybe work for half an hour and then play, or set up a play stationnext to you and you can work together.If you have a partner at home maybe you could set up an office in the bedroom or dining room and take it in turns to work and play  Many schools and nurseries have provided work packs for your children to do.Don’t be tempted to rush through these all in one go, do what their teacher suggests.There are many websites who have learning resources you can access too such as The National Literacy Trust’s Family Zone or Twinklwho have a parents page full of resources for those with children aged from birth.I’ll be sharing lots of the ideas and links from these two sites plus more on my Facebook pageas too much information and too many ideas can be overwhelming!Stock Up, forget the toilet roll and tins!Stock up on glue, crayons, pencils, paint, paper , colouring or activity books and real books too, card, sequins and glitter , flour, salt, food colouring, cake making ingredients, bubbles, cornflour for gloop, jelly for jelly play, bag of sand etc!I know most of us already have a Facebook page and use Whats App but do your parents and their friends I know my mum would be ‘gulp’ why do I need them.But these social media sites will ensure that we are all able to keep in touch with each other, that your Mum and mine will be able to see, her Bowling Buddies, your Mums Knit  Natter friends and this ‘keeping in touch’ will be so very importantthey, and we, can’t go out.So do take the time to teach them and their friends as well, maybe consider too using and showing them how to use Skype or Face Time - it’s great to talk but even better to talk and see each other too!Busy, wondering how exactly you are going to keep busy stuck in the house all day Do the ‘jobs’ you’ve been putting off for the past few years!Plan to decorate, spring clean, learn to sew or knitbuild a pond, sort out the garden or, like me get ready to paint your shed yellow!Can you help anyone  An elderly neighbour, the new mum next door, the single dad who has to work in the hospital, the old lady down the road who now can’t walk her dog, the food bank delivery service  It’s greatyou can, just remember though to protect yourself and your family. Invest in two or three garden chairs or benches, old or new it doesn’t matter, pop them by your fences so you and your neighbours can talk to each other!

At Home … We all love being at home, love the homes we have made, love being with our children and families.But to be restricted to being at home can be dficult, to be advised to stay at home and have our normal routine change can be stressful as we wonder how best to manage and live as normal.So here are a few ideas to help keep you sane, to still enjoy your days and be positive …Working at home  Is dficult at the best of times as the washing calls to be put on the line, the dog looks adoringly at you for a walk, the sun and garden beckon etc.But now with your children off too it’s about to get even harder, with demands for play, shouts of I’m bored, he took my doll, she keeps standing in front of the TV.So why not set up a new routine, plan your day to incorporate activities with the children and work time too.Yes you may have to work later than . pm as you’ll be doing less during usual office hours but at least you will get work done.Do explain that you do have to work, and then try activities with them for an hour and then work for an hour, or set up tasks and play activities they can do themselves play dough, creation station, jigsaws, a video about the natural world etc.If you have little ones at home, those under three years, it’s even harder but maybe your teenagers could help If not then you’ll have to adapt the routine to maybe work for half an hour and then play, or set up a play stationnext to you and you can work together.If you have a partner at home maybe you could set up an office in the bedroom or dining room and take it in turns to work and play  Many schools and nurseries have provided work packs for your children to do.Don’t be tempted to rush through these all in one go, do what their teacher suggests.There are many websites who have learning resources you can access too such as The National Literacy Trust’s Family Zone or Twinklwho have a parents page full of resources for those with children aged from birth.I’ll be sharing lots of the ideas and links from these two sites plus more on my Facebook pageas too much information and too many ideas can be overwhelming!Stock Up, forget the toilet roll and tins!Stock up on glue, crayons, pencils, paint, paper , colouring or activity books and real books too, card, sequins and glitter , flour, salt, food colouring, cake making ingredients, bubbles, cornflour for gloop, jelly for jelly play, bag of sand etc!I know most of us already have a Facebook page and use Whats App but do your parents and their friends I know my mum would be ‘gulp’ why do I need them.But these social media sites will ensure that we are all able to keep in touch with each other, that your Mum and mine will be able to see, her Bowling Buddies, your Mums Knit  Natter friends and this ‘keeping in touch’ will be so very importantthey, and we, can’t go out.So do take the time to teach them and their friends as well, maybe consider too using and showing them how to use Skype or Face Time - it’s great to talk but even better to talk and see each other too!Busy, wondering how exactly you are going to keep busy stuck in the house all day Do the ‘jobs’ you’ve been putting off for the past few years!Plan to decorate, spring clean, learn to sew or knitbuild a pond, sort out the garden or, like me get ready to paint your shed yellow!Can you help anyone  An elderly neighbour, the new mum next door, the single dad who has to work in the hospital, the old lady down the road who now can’t walk her dog, the food bank delivery service  It’s greatyou can, just remember though to protect yourself and your family. Invest in two or three garden chairs or benches, old or new it doesn’t matter, pop them by your fences so you and your neighbours can talk to each other! Talk, Sing, Read And Play with your children every day - with all this time at home there’s no excuse not to! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time. The hammer blow came in the thminute, with Bellaghys goal. Cassidy and Gavin Diamond combined to put Cathal Scullion through, unmarked, to score the goal that ended their losing run in finals.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: – shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible – one form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household – any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and – travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: – close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship – we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with – and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with , former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy – by simply staying at home – we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In light of a rapidly changing situation, we recommend that people consult our Facebook page through the week.This week  people ran, jogged and walked the course, of whom  were first timers and  recorded new personal bests.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :. Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

Yet, when the crisis lands on our collective doorstepsour reaction will probably be fairly similar to this from Alexander McCall Smith:‘The unexpected always happens in the way‘The unexpected has always occurred:Le after the coronavirus willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel : Press Eye Ltd \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...‘While we were doing something ,‘While we are thinking of altogether‘Dferent things – matters that events‘Then show to be every bit as unimportant‘As our human concerns so often are.’For me, aged  and part of that older generation which seems to be at greater risk from Covid-, my immediate reaction was, ‘I thought I would have had more time.’ We all take risks every day driving our car through rush-hour traffic, boarding a plane, climbing a mountain, taking part in some particularly physical sports, tripping over a kerbstone, falling from a ladder. There are also health risks a stroke, heart attack, diagnosis of a crippling disease, onset of cancer, dementia, paralysis.But to some extent all of those are calculated risks. We consider the evidence: yes, we could be killed in a car or plane crash, or break our spine in a rugby scrum. But the calculations are almost always in our favour and we take the risk. And in most circumstancessomething very bad happens, short of death, there is a health service and after-care service to help. But what happens when the calculations are no longer in your favour  What happens when the chances of something potentially le-threatening happening to you rise above % to as high as % – maybe even higher  What happens when you suddenly realise that tens of thousands of people will certainly die, with many thousands of others left with long-term heart and lung complications  What happens when your freedom of movement is restricted for months on end and you have to acknowledge that either you, a member of the family living in the house with you, or someone from your wider circle of family and friends is likely to die  It makes you think about le, doesn’t it  Makes you think about what really matters to you, too, doesn’t it I have accepted that I will probably get Covid- within the next few months: it sort of goes with the territory of being an older dad with young children . And having accepted that I’m likely to get it – as well as accepting that the odds of survival are not comfortably in my favour – I’ve also realised that too much of my le has been wasted in pfling arguments and petty political point-scoring. There were so many things I planned to do when I was , yet haven’t done. All the books I planned to write, but didn’t. All the adventures I’d planned in my head –and yet that’s where they stayed.Most of all, though, I think of Kerri and the children. The last  years have been the happiest of my le. I desperately, desperately hope to still be here when this crisis subsides – as all crises eventually do –only to spend more time with my children. The books, adventures and politics don’t, in the great scheme of things, seem to matter anymore. I’d push them all aside just to know I could be with Lilah, Indy, Megan and Kerrifor a few more years. All le ends, I know that. But, to be brutally honest, I’d be mighty pissed-off to be pushed off this mortal coil by a virionwhich measures just billionths of a metre across.The good news – much more important, of course, than my own personal hopes – is that most of us will survive. Le willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel. The next few months will teach us unexpected things about ourselves, not least of which is the frailty of our very existence and the recognition that something which isn’t even visible to the naked eye is, in terms of destructive power, potentially more dangerous than a war or nuclear bomb. It sees everyone and anyone as a potential target. And even when we get some sort of control over the present virus, there will be another one along at some point.One thing we’ll maybe learn from all of this is, that as a species, we survive together or not at all. I don’t actually mean that in a political sense – because there will always be dferences but it is now clear that certain battles require global responses and global cooperation. We seem to have been caught on the hop with Covid- and we must do our best to ensure we’re never caught on the hop again. On a personal note let me wish all of you the very best over the next few months. Do your best to stay safe and healthy. It will be dficult for all of us and for dferent reasons. But one thing I have noticed – and it gives me enormous hope, evenI’m not about – is that there is a bedrock of inidual compassion, concern, kindness and courage that we don’t see often enough when we think things are ok. I’ll leave you with another few lines from McCall Smith:‘We wait, knowing that when this is over,‘A lot of us – not all perhaps –but most,‘Will be slightly dferent people,‘And our world, though diminished,‘Will be much bigger, its beauty revealed afresh.’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
