Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that I respect the process of justice.\u0027 But, as criticism mounted over her use of the word \u0027banter\u0027 in her evidence, an apologetic Mrs Harris responded: \u0027I understand that banter was an entirely inappropriate, indeed offensive, word to use.\u0027I honestly do not remember making such a comment, and hearing it alleged in court struck me to the core.\u0027It is a word that many LGBT people have heard to justify homophobic abuse for too long. And I apologise — unreservedly and unequivocally — for my use of it.\u0027Miss Clarke, who is still unemployed, is planning to lodge a complaint with Ipsa and the Labour Party, says: \u0027That\u0027s all well and good, but where\u0027s my apology?\u0027For nine years I was loyal to Carolyn and kept quiet, but not any more. She has to go.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/23/4EECC4F600000578-6045215-image-a-16_1533853461711.jpg","title":"Academics call ban live odds gambling ads commercials World Cup misled viewers","story":"    At least some of the commercials could have contravened new marketing codes designed by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to protect the publicThey said this same tactic will be used around Premier League matches starting this weekend and, such are the \u0027significant concerns\u0027 about the impact on punters, it may be necessary to ban all \u0027live odds\u0027 commercials.The team said the use of this type of commercial appears to the against the spirit of ASA guidance, which came into force in April and covers the issues of \u0027impulsiveness and urgency\u0027.The ASA\u0027s code states: \u0027In order not to encourage gambling behaviour that is irresponsible, marketing communications should not unduly pressure the audience to gamble, especially when gambling opportunities offered are subject to a significant time limitation.\u0027 The researchers tracked the frequency and content of \u0027live-odds\u0027 TV adverts shown during all 32 World Cup matches on ITV, with a particular interest in advertising around the England games.          The researchers said 36 \u0027live odds\u0027 adverts were shown during the half-time break of World Cup games. Ten of the ads were for \u0027flash odds\u0027, which are described on the bookmaker\u0027s website as offers that will be gone in a flash if punters are not quick enoughThey found that a total of 63 of the \u0027live-odds\u0027 adverts were shown by five different, unnamed, betting companies during the competition in Russia.The researchers were concerned about one of the commercials shown immediately before the kick-off of England\u0027s match against Colombia, which was watched by 23.8million people. The bet was for \u0027England to score in the first 20 minutes\u0027, which meant people would have to place a bet quickly, and offered odds of 4-to-1.The researchers said 36 \u0027live odds\u0027 adverts were shown during the half-time break of World Cup games.

Experts at the University of Warwick said the hard-sell language and tactics used by the gambling companies created the impression that viewers should rush to have a betThe researchers in applied psychology were also concerned that some adverts were designed in such a way that punters were likely to misjudge the probabilities of winning. One bookmaker advertised a bet ahead on England versus Tunisia, which included: \u0027England to win by three or more goals, Harry Kane to score, and over 11 corners\u0027. The odds were 16-to-1, but customers would only win if all three elements turned out to be correct.The academics said because each part of the bet feels likely to happen, people overestimate the chances of all three elements occurring. In fact, anyone who took up the bet lost, because while Harry Kane scored twice, England only won by a single goal margin. Betting firm William Hill warns it may have to close 900...Betting firms who target youngsters in adverts will face...Share this articlePrevious research by the group found these bets come in less often than fans think and have very high profit margins for the bookies.The research report entitled \u0027Impulsiveness and urgency: Gambling advertising and the 2018 soccer World Cup\u0027 was written by Dr Philip Newall, Mr Ankush Thobhani, Dr Lukasz Walasek and Professor Caroline Meyer.Dr Newall said: \u0027Technology and legislation have transformed the UK\u0027s gambling scene. Football betting used to be relatively low frequency, with bets being made in person or via telephone, and most matches held on Saturday afternoons.

He has swum in a glacial lake on Everest and braved the freezing waters off Antarctica. He was the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five of Earth\u0027s oceans, and has swum the length of the Thames. And now he aims to become the first person to swim the full length of the Channel — that\u0027s 330 miles.The narrowest distance across the Channel is a mere 22 miles. Since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim it in 1875 (though he went off course and ended up swimming 39 miles), 1,800 people have emulated him, including Pugh in 1992.But no one has ever swum its full length — the equivalent of 15 Channel crossings, from Land\u0027s End to Dover, in just cap, goggles and swimming trunks.          United Nations Environment Programme Patron of the Oceans Lewis Pugh at the Speedo and Surfers Against Sewage Marazion Beach Clean UpUnder Channel Swimming Association rules, that — plus as much grease as he wants — is all Pugh is allowed to wear. He mustn\u0027t touch his support boat, the Aquila, during his daily swims, or ever swim behind it or behind another person, because he might then benefit from the slipstream.Pugh started at Land\u0027s End on July 12 and after 28 days has completed about 180 miles, following the coastline at a distance and generally, when not swimming, spending all his time on the support boat, which must drop anchor whenever he finishes a swim. He is now off Bournemouth, in Dorset.\u0027Having several days of unexpectedly good tides has meant I am six miles ahead of where I was meant to be by day 27,\u0027 Pugh said this week.Gay man claims discrimination after he was kicked out of...Warning as venomous weever fish that swim in shallow water...Share this article\u0027This is a weight off my shoulders, as it means that if we have a day of bad weather or if I\u0027m struggling with an injury, we have the flexibility to not swim for a day without getting behind.\u0027After spending more than 60 hours swimming in the Channel, he has lost so much weight that he is now on this third pair of ever-smaller Speedos. He has also been struggling with a shoulder injury and yesterday saw a physiotherapist at AFC Bournemouth.So why is he doing it? Like all his swimming feats, there is a purpose: what he calls \u0027the long swim\u0027 marks the beginning of a worldwide campaign to ensure that 30 per cent of our oceans are fully protected by 2030.

It was happening as Emiliano\u0027s family were grooming him for a political career.\u0027From what I heard from high-ranking defectors, the supposed plan was to get Emi into office in Mexico\u0027s next Presidential election in the summer of 2018 so that a top-ranking Espian and NXIVM devotee would have power on the world\u0027s political stage,\u0027 Oxenberg writes.\u0027His father, Carlos, would use his Machiavellian methods to ensure his son\u0027s election win, and then Keith would use Emi as his puppet and rule Mexico.\u0027Emiliano revealed in April that he had cut all ties with NXIVM.  Men had been signing up for a male\u0027s course in droves, according to Oxenberg.    The Dynasty star says her 27-year-old daughter India was branded with Keith Raniere and Allison Mack\u0027s initials. Pictured above is the branding on one of the women\u0027While the men thought that they were being trained to become honorable, noble protectors of humanity, they were actually being molded to serve as mindless soldiers in Keith\u0027s perverse army - the sole goal of which was to protect Vanguard (Raniere) and his harem,\u0027 she wrote.After she started investigating the group to free her daughter, Oxenberg says she received \u0027threatening letters\u0027 from a NXIVM lawyer, as well as a Mexican state attorney general, accusing her of fraud and extortion. She said the group had such power that one Mexican TV reporter she spoke to begged her not to reveal his name because he feared being killed. \u0027He wasn\u0027t joking... Not only was he referencing the cult\u0027s potential power in Mexico, because it was populated with so many of the country\u0027s rich, famous, and most elite citizens, but he was also acknowledging the danger that one of those citizens was Emiliano Salinas. His father, Carlos, the most feared man in the country, would do anything for his son,\u0027 she wrote. Raniere fled to Mexico but was arrested this year and taken to the US to face charges that he, along with an adherent, Smallville actress Allison Mack, coerced followers into becoming slaves to senior members.The controversial group, headquartered in New York, is led by Keith Raniere (left) and his right-hand woman, Allison Mack (right).

He is now among hundreds of Chinese men sharing beauty tips online in the booming industryHowever, many people, especially the older generation, still find men putting on make-up weird and unacceptable in the largely conservative country.For Jiang, the fear of being ridiculed by his own parents stops him from picking up the make-up brush in front of them.\u0027I don\u0027t want to have conflict with my parents. We don\u0027t see eye to eye, our values and concepts of life are different.\u0027I\u0027m not saying that they don\u0027t think me putting on make-up is bad or anything, but they are just unable to accept the daily make-up routine for a man,\u0027 he says. Mo Fei, the executive director for Chetti Rouge, a Chinese cosmetics company targeting men exclusively, says that will change over time.          Lan applying eyeshadow from a colourful palette before filming for his 1.4 million followers on Weibo          For Jiang, the fear of being ridiculed by his own parents stops him from picking up the make-up brush in front of them          Jiang prepares to film a video at home. Chinese e-commerce companies such as Alibaba and JD.com have launched live-streaming platforms that allow viewers to purchase the products while watching the videos\u0027There will be more and more men who take more care in how they look and the demands will increase. Men in the East are more accepting,\u0027 Mo says.He opened Chetti Rouge in 2005 with few products. Now the beauty company sells a wide variety of cosmetics ranging from foundation to lipstick solely for men and has moved the entire business online.\u0027We saw potential in the market very early on,\u0027 Mo told AFP, adding that the company expanded to Thailand three years ago.\u0027It might be that men have accepted make-up. For men to browse products in shopping malls, may be for some men a little intimidating, hence the best way for them to buy is online, which is why our sales strategy is mainly on the internet.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/09/01/05BBCE76000003E8-0-image-a-7_1533776383474.jpg","title":"Israels Culture Minister Miri Regev called state sanctioned assassinations Hamas leaders","story":"    Controversial: Culture Minister Miri Regev called for state-sanctioned assassinations of Hamas leaders in the wake of this week\u0027s exchange of fire between Gaza and IsraelPalestinian Hamas-run media reported that an Egypt-brokered deal had taken hold \u0027on the basis of mutual calm\u0027, however, Israel\u0027s government has not confirmed such a truce. Visiting local leaders in Israeli communities near the Gaza strip, Mrs Regev said: \u0027The equation should be very simple: If our children live in fear, then the leadership of Hamas should live in fear.Israel and Hamas \u0027on a ceasefire\u0027 following two days of...UN envoy `deeply alarmed´ by escalation in violence in Gaza...Share this article\u0027We must go back to the policy of targeted assassinations of leaders of this murderous terrorist group,\u0027 she told The Jerusalem Post.Mrs Regev is a former Brigadier-general in the Israel Defense Forces and a former IDF spokesperson who has become known for her controversial political statements. In 2012 the mother-of-three infamously declared Sudanese asylum seekers in Israel \u0027a cancer on our body\u0027.She has been Minister for Culture and Sport since 2015 and has served as acting Prime Minister when Benjamin Netanyahu has been abroad.            Israel\u0027s Iron Dome defence system launches an interceptor missile as rockets are launched from Gaza toward the southern city of Sderot  The debris of Said Al-Mashal Foundation for Arts and Culture building after Israeli forces conducted airstrikes in the strip\u0027s capital city           A wounded Palestinian boy is brought into al-Shifa hospital on Thursday following the Israeli air strike on Gaza City           Smoke rises from buildings in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes rained down on the independently governed territory in what the government says was retaliation for Hamas strikes This week\u0027s fighting saw Israel hit some 150 facilities belonging to Hamas in retaliation for \u0027180 rockets and mortar bombs\u0027 allegedly fired from the strip on Wednesday night.The Israeli airstrikes overnight on Wednesday killed three Palestinians, including a 23-year-old pregnant woman and her 18-month-old daughter. A source within Israel\u0027s military warned Thursday that \u0027a full-blown military confrontation in the Gaza Strip\u0027 was near and its government could start evacuating citizens near the border.Thursday evening, at least two rockets allegedly fired from the Gaza Strip landed in Israel on Thursday night, according to the country\u0027s authorities, including just outside Beersheba.  Although nobody was injured, it marked the first time since 2014 that a rocket had penetrated that deep inside the country, according to the country\u0027s media.            Children negotiate the smoky streets of Gaza following the bombardment today as the Israelis claimed they were retaliating against Hamas strikes           Smoke rises from an explosion after an Israeli airstrike on the Saidd al-Mis\u0027hal cultural centre in Gaza City on Thursday           People inspect the rubble of a building after it was destroyed by an Israeli air strike on Gaza City on Thursday           Palestinians inspect the ruins of the Said al-Mishal Cultural Center building which was left completely destroyed          A child crawls over the rubble of the cultural centre building which was wrecked by the Israeli air strike           An aerial view of the wreckage of the Said al-Mishal Cultural Centre in the west of Gaza City after the air strike Shortly after, an Israeli airstrike flattened the five-story cultural center in the Shati refugee camp, a crowded neighbourhood of Gaza City. The airstrike set off a powerful explosion and sent a huge plume of black smoke into the air, causing crowds to scream in panic.

Carolyn Harris, Welsh deputy leader, vehemnetly denies the accusations and described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027          The \u0027dyke boots\u0027 that Miss Clarke wore to work were ridiculed by her boss, Mrs Harris says she does not remember saying anything and if she did it would have been \u0027banter\u0027They were made during the trial of Miss Clarke, her former constituency office manager, on fraud and forgery charges. Last week, Miss Clarke was cleared at Cardiff Crown Court after being accused of awarding herself a £2,000 pay rise and cutting her work hours without her boss\u0027s authority.Miss Clarke, 42, had been accused of forging Mrs Harris\u0027s signature on a form, submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) in August 2015, increasing her £37,000-a-year salary and reducing her 40-hour working week to 37.5 hours.When Ipsa sent a confidential email to Mrs Harris to confirm the change, the prosecution claimed Miss Clarke accessed the MP\u0027s account and replied: \u0027Yes, this is correct.\u0027 Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ¿witch hunt¿...Corbyn \u0027handed ultimatum by powerful backers Momentum who...Share this articleBut Miss Clarke insisted she was following Mrs Harris\u0027s verbal instructions, claiming it was common practice for her to sign forms on behalf of the \u0027over-bearing\u0027 MP, whom, she said, \u0027detested paperwork\u0027.Indeed, the picture Miss Clarke painted of a highly dysfunctional office — hotly disputed by the MP — raises questions about Carolyn Harris\u0027s suitability for the Shadow front bench role.For Miss Clarke claimed in court that the MP had also \u0027outed\u0027 her to colleagues, after she confided in Mrs Harris she was gay in 2011, quizzed her on her sex life and made fun of her \u0027dyke\u0027 boots.          Miss Clarke says working for Mrs Harris felt like being in the \u0027Army\u0027 and that she felt \u0027more like a slave than an employee\u0027Here, in her first interview since she was cleared, Miss Clarke reveals she, too, was at the Swansea Pride event — and hid from her former boss.\u0027I felt sick when I saw her dancing, waving her arms and laughing with people at the parade. I was so overwhelmed by anxiety, I was shaking,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027From the day I confided in her that I was in a gay relationship, her attitude towards me seemed to change overnight.\u0027Miss Clarke also alleged in court that in November 2014, Mrs Harris had grabbed her by the hair as she sat at her desk, violently shaking her head — a claim strenuously denied by the MPInstead, Mrs Harris described a \u0027lovely\u0027 office atmosphere filled with \u0027banter\u0027, where colleagues were friends who laughed and talked about \u0027anything and everything\u0027.As for the reference to \u0027dyke\u0027 boots, she said: \u0027I don\u0027t remember saying that, but if I did, it would have been banter. I\u0027m certainly not homophobic. I\u0027m an ally of the LGBT community and I always have been.\u0027The jury took just 90 minutes to acquit Miss Clarke, who has joined calls for the MP to resign from the front bench, claiming working for Mrs Harris left her a \u0027nervous wreck\u0027 on antidepressants.          Miss Clarke claims she was assaulted in November 2014 when Mrs Harris began rubbing her shoulders before grabbing her hair and violently shaking her head backwards and forwards\u0027I gave nine years of loyalty to Carolyn, but she never showed me any of the respect I watched her give to the marchers at Spring Pride,\u0027 she says.Sitting in the two-bedroom council maisonette she shares with daughter Rachael, 22, tears well up as she recalls how her dream job turned sour, ending with her arrest and the threat of up to two years in jail.\u0027All I\u0027m guilty of is being naive and stupid,\u0027 she says. \u0027Nothing happened in that office that Carolyn didn\u0027t know about. She called me her \u0027office angel\u0027, but working for her felt like being in the Army. Sometimes I felt more like a slave than an employee.\u0027If I could go back, I\u0027d insist on doing everything by the book, but I put up and shut up because I was a single parent and I didn\u0027t want to lose a well-paid job.\u0027Miss Clarke was a mature student at Swansea University, reading social sciences and criminology, when she became a part-time aide for the then Swansea East MP, Sian James, in September 2008.          Senior party members are calling on Mrs Harris to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations and she is also facing calls for an investigation into the alleged assaultShe worked as case worker in the busy office, dealing with constituents\u0027 problems. A life-long Labour supporter, she loved her new job.Heading the small team was Carolyn Harris, who was office manager. From the start, Miss Clarke — who saw little of MP Mrs James, who was often in the House of Commons — says she found Mrs Harris \u0027forceful, loud, abrupt, bossy and lacking in tact\u0027.Single mother Miss Clarke had split from her male partner of 17 years when their daughter was five. In 2010, she started her first gay relationship with neighbour Rihanna Power, 32, who she\u0027s still with. \u0027When I met Rhianna, something just clicked,\u0027 she says. \u0027I was the happiest I\u0027d ever been in a relationship.\u0027In 2011, during a meeting to discuss work performance, Miss Clarke decided to confide in Mrs Harris: \u0027It was no one else\u0027s business, but the very next day in the office Carolyn started going on about how I had some news for everyone,\u0027 she says.\u0027My colleagues kept asking: \u0027What is it, Jen?\u0027 I felt goaded into revealing I was in a gay relationship. One colleague rolled her eyes and said: \u0027Is that it? I thought you were going to say you had cancer, the way Carolyn was going on.\u0027 \u0027Then, Miss Clarke claims, Mrs Harris\u0027s comments about her appearance started. \u0027When I started working there, I was always smart, but after a while I started dressing in more relaxed clothes, sometimes in jeans,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I came in and Carolyn said: \u0027Look at you in your dyke boots.\u0027 Then to everyone else, she said: \u0027Jen has her dyke boots on today.\u0027\u0027I was absolutely mortified — embarrassed rather than angry, so I just sat at my desk, kept my head down and tried to ignore it.\u0027It was said in a jokey voice, and perhaps she didn\u0027t realise it had upset me, but it\u0027s moonshine for her to suggest we were all sitting around laughing and exchanging banter.\u0027Former MP Sian James told the jury Miss Clarke had raised the issue with her in 2013, upset over references to her clothing and the use of the word \u0027dyke\u0027, which she found offensive.\u0027She was starting to feel it had gone beyond banter and it was causing her concern,\u0027 she said, adding that the matter was addressed informally.\u0027She (Mrs Harris) was very shocked. She was very concerned that these comments, made within the atmosphere of the office, had caused hurt to Jenny. Both of them were very keen that the issue was addressed.\u0027Certainly, Miss Clarke never considered leaving her job, believing the matter had been resolved.She does not deny that Mrs Harris could be nice, too, giving her holidays in her mother\u0027s caravan, a TV and a car — but she felt such kindnesses came with strings attached. She says the favours left her feeling indebted and \u0027manipulated\u0027 into being at her boss\u0027s \u0027beck and call\u0027 — offering to clean the caravan, mow lawns and build furniture for Mrs Harris\u0027s son.Then, in November 2014, came the alleged assault, which Miss Clarke says she is still struggling to understand. Mrs Harris insists the allegation is untrue. She believes it was made as a result of jealousy caused by her selection to succeed Mrs James as the MP, after she stepped down in May 2015.\u0027I was sitting at my desk typing, when Carolyn walked past and started rubbing my shoulders,\u0027 claims Miss Clarke.\u0027Suddenly I felt her hands grip my hair and start moving my head violently backwards and forwards. I screamed: \u0027What are you doing? Get off!\u0027 I had to grip onto her hands to let go. It hurt like hell.\u0027It was as if she just flipped. When I challenged her, she dropped to her knees and kept saying how sorry she was, and how she loved me more than her son. She just couldn\u0027t explain it.\u0027I wish I\u0027d gone to the police then, but she was crying and seemed so sorry. It was Sian\u0027s last few months as an MP before standing down, and I didn\u0027t want to ruin things for her, so I decided to let it drop, but that night I couldn\u0027t sleep I was in so much pain and had to hold ice packs to my head.\u0027Paulette Smith, a Labour councillor who worked in the office at the time of the alleged assault — or a disaffected former employee in the eyes of Mrs Harris — told the jury she had witnessed the alleged assault. She spoke of a \u0027blood-curdling scream\u0027 and seeing Mrs Harris\u0027s hands, with tufts of Miss Clarke\u0027s hair in them. \u0027Jen was in agony,\u0027 she said.Nevertheless, when Mrs Harris was elected MP, Miss Clarke agreed to become office manager.\u0027Carolyn\u0027s ego went through the roof. Suddenly it felt like being in the Army. She wanted us to sign in, she wanted calls recorded, she wanted to know everything that was happening,\u0027 says Miss Clarke.\u0027One day I was sorting out pay rise forms for her, and Carolyn said to me: \u0027Give yourself an extra £2,000 while you are at it,\u0027 so stupidly I took her at her word and did just that.\u0027It wasn\u0027t forgery, I didn\u0027t try to copy Carolyn\u0027s signature, I just wrote her name just as I\u0027d done on countless other documents.\u0027Without telling her boss, Miss Clarke also reduced her hours to bring them in line with colleagues after noticing a discrepancy.\u0027It was stupid, but I knew Ipsa would email Mrs Harris for confirmation and she\u0027d see it then. She seemed fine with it. It was agreed I\u0027d send the confirmation back.\u0027 Mrs Harris denied this in court or authorising the pay rise. Demoted and then dismissed in January 2016, for unrelated matters, Miss Clarke lodged a grievance and decided to make a complaint to the police about the alleged assault two years earlier — but falling outside time limits, no action was taken.Last weekend, the BBC reported that Jeremy Corbyn and First Minister Carwyn Jones were both fully supporting Mrs Harris.But some Labour members of the Welsh Assembly and senior party members are calling on her to quit — or for Mr Corbyn to suspend her from the frontbench — over the allegations.She is also facing calls for a Labour investigation into the alleged assault.National Executive Committee member John Lansman said last week: \u0027I don\u0027t believe that Carolyn Harris can continue as a frontbench spokesperson on equalities when she has been accused in open court with supportive evidence of having used homophobic language.\u0027I think she needs to be removed from her role and in my view there must be an immediate investigation of the alleged assault.\u0027Welsh Government Environment Minister Hannah Blythyn, one of three LGBT politicians elected to the Assembly in 2016, said in a tweet: \u0027It\u0027s never banter — it\u0027s homophobic language.\u0027In a statement released by Mrs Harris\u0027s parliamentary office after Miss Clarke\u0027s acquittal, the MP said: \u0027When I uncovered evidence of wrongdoing in my office, I immediately reported it to the relevant authorities.\u0027However, in this instance the jury found the case was not provable beyond reasonable doubt. It goes without saying that I respect the process of justice.\u0027 But, as criticism mounted over her use of the word \u0027banter\u0027 in her evidence, an apologetic Mrs Harris responded: \u0027I understand that banter was an entirely inappropriate, indeed offensive, word to use.\u0027I honestly do not remember making such a comment, and hearing it alleged in court struck me to the core.\u0027It is a word that many LGBT people have heard to justify homophobic abuse for too long.

The researchers said 36 \u0027live odds\u0027 adverts were shown during the half-time break of World Cup games. Ten of the ads were for \u0027flash odds\u0027, which are described on the bookmaker\u0027s website as offers that will be gone in a flash if punters are not quick enoughThey found that a total of 63 of the \u0027live-odds\u0027 adverts were shown by five different, unnamed, betting companies during the competition in Russia.The researchers were concerned about one of the commercials shown immediately before the kick-off of England\u0027s match against Colombia, which was watched by 23.8million people. The bet was for \u0027England to score in the first 20 minutes\u0027, which meant people would have to place a bet quickly, and offered odds of 4-to-1.The researchers said 36 \u0027live odds\u0027 adverts were shown during the half-time break of World Cup games. Ten of the ads were for \u0027flash odds\u0027, which are described on the bookmaker\u0027s website as offers that will be gone in a flash if punters are not quick enough.          Experts at the University of Warwick said the hard-sell language and tactics used by the gambling companies created the impression that viewers should rush to have a betThe researchers in applied psychology were also concerned that some adverts were designed in such a way that punters were likely to misjudge the probabilities of winning. One bookmaker advertised a bet ahead on England versus Tunisia, which included: \u0027England to win by three or more goals, Harry Kane to score, and over 11 corners\u0027. The odds were 16-to-1, but customers would only win if all three elements turned out to be correct.The academics said because each part of the bet feels likely to happen, people overestimate the chances of all three elements occurring. In fact, anyone who took up the bet lost, because while Harry Kane scored twice, England only won by a single goal margin. Betting firm William Hill warns it may have to close 900...Betting firms who target youngsters in adverts will face...Share this articlePrevious research by the group found these bets come in less often than fans think and have very high profit margins for the bookies.The research report entitled \u0027Impulsiveness and urgency: Gambling advertising and the 2018 soccer World Cup\u0027 was written by Dr Philip Newall, Mr Ankush Thobhani, Dr Lukasz Walasek and Professor Caroline Meyer.Dr Newall said: \u0027Technology and legislation have transformed the UK\u0027s gambling scene.

She has lived in the back of a van in a cage.\u0027She just had that crate in the back, she didn\u0027t even have the run of the whole of the van.\u0027It can be 32C outside and she would be cooking in the back of that van.\u0027It\u0027s been his bear for so many years and bizarrely he wanted to come and see that she is going to a good place.\u0027The first time he brought her here I told him to take her out of the back of the van.

Two decades on, a new award celebrating the funniest novels by women has been announced, in the wake of a sexism row over the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction.Awarded each year at the Hay literary festival, the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize has gone to three female authors in 18 years: Helen Fielding, Marina Lewycka and Hannah Rothschild. Earlier this summer, the bestselling novelist Marian Keyes laid into the Wodehouse – previously the UK’s only prize for funny fiction – for its “sexist imbalance”.“I think by giving the men the prizes, it just reinforces that the men are more important … I love many men but that doesn’t mean that I don’t see the sexist imbalance,” said Keyes in June. “Male voices are automatically given extra weight. I mean, anything that’s ever been said or done by a woman just matters less.”The Comedy women in print prize (CWIP) has now been launched by Helen Lederer, who told the  that “more needs to be done to celebrate the achievements of women excelling in this field”. She said she hoped it would “bring forward the next generation of female talent as well as shine a light on women who have an established comedy writing career”.Lederer is an award-winning comedian, writer and actor who is best known for her role as Catriona in Absolutely Fabulous. She published her debut novel, Losing It, in 2015. “As soon as I’d written my novel I looked around for prizes to win (as you do) and there were none,” she said. “Then I got excited about doing something to redress the imbalance. Now that the CWIP is finally on the literary map - it’s as if it was always meant to be there … funny that.”Keyes – one of the judges for the CWIP – said: “There are countless hilarious, talented female writers currently producing great work. If existing prizes won’t honour funny women writers fairly, it’s time to set up a new prize.”The CWIP will offer two awards – a £2,000 prize for published female writers, and a £1,000 prize with a free place on the University of Hertfordshire’s MA in creative writing for an unpublished writer. Judges will be looking, they said, for “evidence of wit ranging from irony to absurdity – offering laugh out loud moments and a sense of connection, truth and recognition to the reader”.The prize will open for submissions on 24 August, with a longlist announced in March 2019, a shortlist in May and the winners unveiled next June.Jennifer Young, a judge for the prize as well as a novelist and senior lecturer in creative writing at the University of Hertfordshire, predicted it would fill a significant gap.“Women are routinely overlooked for their comedic work, particularly in fiction. As Marian Keyes has pointed out, she’s never been shortlisted for the Wodehouse prize, despite her great success as a writer,” said Young.“Women’s writing often struggles to get equal attention to men’s, and if the writing is comedic, the situation becomes even more difficult. We’ve all heard the token woman on Radio 4 comedy programmes – the assumption seems to be that men can be funnier than women. Is it that women should be pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to, rather than using their voices to push boundaries? CWIP sets out to challenge that – and to recognise and celebrate women’s ability to be comedic in many ways.”This year, the Wodehouse prize was cancelled for the first time since it began, after judges announced that none of the 62 books submitted “incited the level of unanimous laughter we have come to expect”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97dfe5bc02c4bf481d848988fa3477a6e3106c97/0_149_4228_2537/master/4228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a6fdf208c69a9466d2871e752f9b9f8","title":"ryanair pilot strike grounds nearly 400 flights","story":"Airline says 396 flights will not take off on Friday because of walkouts across five countriesAlmost 400 Ryanair flights scheduled for Friday have been grounded because of pilot strikes.Employees in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands are staging a 24-hour walkout over pay and conditions.The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, said 396 flights were cancelled, which could affect more than 74,000 passengers. Ryanair said it had informed customers as early as possible about the changes, but some said they had been given little notice.Karen Millar wrote: “Many thanks to Ryanair for cancelling my flight home and ensuring all the de-stressing I have done on this trip is cancelled out in an instant.”Others said they had to pay for extra nights in hotels and booking flights with other airlines.“Ryanair took every step to minimise the disruption and we notified our customers as early as possible, advising them of their free move, refund or reroute options.“The majority of customers affected have already been reaccommodated on another Ryanair flight. We want to again apologise to customers affected by this unnecessary disruption and we ask the striking unions to continue negotiations instead of calling any more unjustified strikes.”In December, Ryanair agreed to recognise trade unions for pilots and cabin crew in an attempt to head off strikes planned in the run-up to Christmas.The airline’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, had previously said he would rather cut off his hands than agree to union recognition.However, after making deals with unions in countries including the UK and Italy, the airline has failed to engage with workers, the unions claim.Pilots and cabin crew have responded with a string of strikes seeking better terms and conditions, with industrial action partly to blame for profits falling in the first quarter of Ryanair’s financial year.Cabin staff in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain walked out for 48 hours last month. Ryanair responded to strikes in Ireland by issuing redundancy notices to 300 staff in Dublin and shifting some planes from Ireland to Poland.The airline has been accused of unlawfully trying to deter workers from striking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff15973bc24e2527cb588d088f23661330ecfaa9/251_1882_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8149cafc0e873976cc0f7e3d077237dd","title":"eternal city dome rome monochrome photography in pictures","story":"The Royal Institute of British Architects has thousand of black and white photographs of the Eternal City.

Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

One of the trickiest issues concerns freedom of movement. To many in the EU, this sits alongside the freedom to trade goods, services and capital across national borders: the four freedoms are inisible. Plainly, Britain cannot expect the right to drastically curb immigration from the EU while seeking the right to keep trade flowing freely and without friction.However, freedom of movement has never been absolute. A number of countries recognise the right to free movement for labour, but not the complete right to free movement of people. They welcome those from the rest of the EU who come to work or study, but not to stay if they don’t have a job or college place.YouGov has found only limited support for completely unfettered free movement – but clear majority support for the kind of qualified freedom advocated by the CBI.What lies behind this public rejection of the kind of draconian target that May has embraced since she was home secretary? Two further YouGov findings help to explain what is going on.There is a third factor. In recent years, YouGov and Ipsos Mori have found that many voters, and especially those most critical of the EU, believe that far more EU immigrants are receiving out-of-work welfare benefits than those reported in government statistics. A big part of the anti-immigration mood flowed from a belief that hundreds of thousands of EU nationals, especially from eastern Europe, regarded the UK as a soft touch and came here as “welfare tourists”.Spasmodic attempts to show that this was not true came to nothing. But it is increasingly clear that the great majority of British voters are happy to admit economically useful EU immigrants, so long as this freedom is not extended to those who do not have, or do not quickly obtain, a job or university place.Michel Barnier has been reported this week as being willing to soften his stance on freedom of movement. The CBI has suggested one way forward. The British public are up for a qualified freedom of movement. Can May’s “tens of thousands” target last much longer?• Peter Kellner is a former president of YouGov"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b7c4e571e105fb55c4ea5d516eb34747d80d8f4/0_0_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdfa3d6e9d8eba29fd4d76136c2b380","title":"the guardian view on food cultures sharing not snatching","story":"Much of the joy of food lies in sharing: the passing of dishes across the table the adoption of new ingredients and techniques. Curries and pasta have become staple parts of the British diet, while Malaysian hawkers use an Australian malted chocolate drink to make “roti Milo”. Even if some adaptations have niche appeal – durian pizza, anyone? – exchange enriches us all.This is why some are worried by suggestions of “cultural appropriation” when it comes to cooking. In Britain, the issue has boiled over after the discovery of a string of offensive posts and videos from a white chef who makes Thai food. He exchanged the letters L and R to mock Asian accents, made vile remarks about Thai people and others, and told people to “go down to the jungle and ask the monkey for a coconut” over a still of Brixton market. He has since been fired by the restaurant\u0026nbspSom Saa, and its co-founder (who had praised one of\u0026nbspthe videos) has also apologised.It is true that the primary issue here is one of plain racism. But the other one is that this man made his living from the accumulated work and knowledge of people he treated with contempt. In doing so he highlighted broader issues about who owns, profits from and takes the credit for food cultures. The American writer Ruth Tam has written powerfully about the bittersweet knowledge that “the same dishes hyped as ‘authentic’ on trendy menus were scorned when cooked in the homes of the immigrants who brought them here”.These issues are particularly raw, so to speak, given other recent controversies. Activists in the US have targeted the Chicago-based Aloha Poke Co chain (none of its owners understood to be native Hawaiians) for sending legal letters telling restaurants, including those run by Hawaiians, to stop using “aloha” or “aloha poke” in their names both the word aloha and the dish poke (diced raw fish) originate in Hawaii. The firm says it is only trying to stop misuse of its trademark “Aloha Poke” in\u0026nbspconnection with restaurants.There’s nothing wrong with experimentation an obsessive veneration of “authenticity” can be a kind of exoticisation in itself. The problem comes when making a food more fashionable, or an easier fit for western tastes, is equated with making it “better”.Equally, no one is suggesting it is wrong to cook food from another culture. Mexico gave the Englishwoman Diana Kennedy its highest honour for her remarkable knowledge of its cuisine. Some of those querying the Gordon Ramsay show suggested the late Anthony Bourdain, who showed such genuine curiosity and enthusiasm in approaching different cultures, as a model for how it should be done.The issue, as the food writer Sejal Sukhadwala observed, is cooking another’s food without understanding or respect, and then profiting from it. The recipe for happy exchange demands one essential ingredient: humility. Enjoy the feast, but do not insult your host or hog the dishes. Sharing is delightful. Snatching is not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3858e219daf49333df2a229cd35097f8f31725b/0_207_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e36f93e169ce4b366d90f21c6efa26e","title":"unite the right rally alt right demise","story":"The rally’s goal to reunite the extreme ‘alt-right’ with the radical ‘alt-light’ has failed as they grow further apartThis weekend the extreme right, or “alt-right”, will descend on Washington DC to try and regain the media spotlight in a rerun of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. Like most sequels, Unite the Right 2 will be a weak copy of the original. Even the organizer, Jason Kessler, seems to acknowledge this. He applied for a permit for a rally of about 400 people, while estimates of the turnout at the Charlottesville rally in 2017 range from between 500 and 1,500 far right protesters.This year’s Unite the Right 2 reflects the demise of the extreme right. Since Charlottesville, so-called “alt-right” activists have organized or attended 32 public events in the US, according to Carla Hill of anti-extremism watchdog Anti-Defamation League (ADL). The clear majority of these events were “flash demonstrations”, where five to 20 people briefly appeared to unfold a banner to protest immigration – a signature strategy of the marginal “alt-right” group Identity Evropa. At the same time, radical right, or “alt-light” groups such as Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys have organized a few larger rallies, mostly in the north-western part of the country, more reminiscent of last year’s Charlottesville frenzy.The myth of Charlottesville is that the rally was a big success for the alt-right. However, the organizers had two major political goals for the rally: firstly, to show the country that the alt-right is not just a social media phenomenon, and secondly, to bring various far right groups together. Neither of these goals was realized.Whether 500 or 1,500 people attended, Unite the Right was undoubtedly one of the largest explicitly extreme right rallies in recent US history. But while 1,500 people looks impressive in a town of 50,000, they came from all over the country, and constitute only a minuscule faction of the alt-right trolls on social media, let alone of the population of 325 million that live in the US. Moreover, much of the actual mobilization came from the usual suspects of the US far right, such as neo-Confederate groups such as the League of the South, white supremacists such as the various Klans, and neo-Nazi groups such as the National Socialist Movement.And while various old and new alt-right groups and iniduals did come together in Charlottesville, the explicit goal was to reunite the extreme right with the radical right, after the two had grown increasingly apart in the wake of Trump’s victory. But the alt-light boycotted Unite the Right, with prominent leaders including Mike Cernovich later denouncing it as “a trap”. Since Charlottesville, the two factions have grown apart even further, attacking each other online, and organizing parallel rallies – such as the Freedom of Speech Rally and Rally Against Political Violence in Washington DC last summer.But the more important legacies of the Unite the Right rally go far beyond the internal struggles within the far right. As is so often the case, they reflect longer ongoing trends within the conservative movement, which Donald Trump amplified with blunt, provocative statements. In his now infamous comments on the violent rally, the president lashed out at the counter-protesters and said there were “fine people on both sides”.As the media has reported in past months, more and more of these “fine people” from the far-right are finding their way to the Republican party, even winning primaries and getting on the ballot for local, regional, and national races. At least one of them, Paul Nehlen, who hopes to replace House speaker Paul Ryan, is scheduled to attend Unite the Right 2.While the normalization of open extreme right candidates like Nehlen remains limited to parts of the Republican base, open radical right candidates are taking over the Grand Old Party across the American heartland, shaping the party more and more in the image of its leader. Backed enthusiastically by Trump, they have won Republican primaries by promising to “put Georgia first” (Brian Kemp) or to “stamp out” sanctuary cities (Kris Kobach).At the same time, anti-left hysteria is reaching feverish levels within conservative America, fueled by mainstream media and organizations like Fox News and the NRA. But the anti-left paranoia does not remain limited to opportunistic propaganda. House Republicans are trying to push an “unmasking antifa bill” through Congress, while the FBI is investigating “Antifa sympathizers”.All of this is in part a consequence of the highly problematic media coverage of far right rallies like Unite the Right. Not only does the excessive media attention make both the alt-right and the antifa seem bigger and more relevant than they are, but it also inflates their potential for violence. Moreover, the uncritical coverage, as well as the obligatory liberal false equivalence narrative, strengthens the impression that the real threat comes from the left.For example, most media report that primarily antifa protesters are arrested after far right rallies, but few report that they are specifically targeted by the police, who not only turn a blind eye to the weaponry of the far right, but sometimes even work together with them in “enforcing the law”. If anything positive is to come out of the Unite the Right 2 rally this weekend, let it be a more critical and responsible media coverage of the alt-right and antifa alike, as well as the ways in which law enforcement and politicians deal with them."},{"url":null,"title":"late night roundup jimmy kimmel space force","story":"Late-night comics discussed the Space Force announcement and if Donald Trump will sit down for an interview with Robert MuellerLate-night hosts on Thursday discussed the prospect of Donald Trump sitting down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller and the formation of Space Force.ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel detailed the president’s Space Force.“From the Pentagon this morning, Vice-President Pence made it official, calling for the formation of a new and exciting branch of the United States military,” Kimmel said. He then showed footage of Mike Pence announcing the Space Force, part of US efforts to “prepare for the next battlefield where America’s best and bravest will be called to deter and defeat a new generation of threats to our people”.“That was not a scene from a movie,” Kimmel added. “The Space Force is actually happening. They’ve got plans, they’re finding money. Michael Bay is on board to direct the whole thing.” Kimmel went on: “I watched this whole announcement this morning and I was impressed by the fact that Mike Pence was somehow able to make an announcement about interspace warfare boring. That’s hard to do.”“Of course, no one is more excited about this than Darth Traitor, Donald Trump,” Kimmel said, reading Trump’s tweet. “Space Force all the way!” he wrote.“They’re already working on a logo for the Space Force,” said the host. “In fact, the Trump campaign sent an email to their donors asking them to vote on a possible Space Force logo.”After showing the options sent to Trump supporters, Kimmel said: “The logo for the Space Force should just be a picture of money being shredded and thrown at the moon.”“Trump remains on vacation, but it’s a working vacation, because he’s still lying,” began Stephen Colbert. “According to one reporter’s tally, Trump made 132 false claims last week, which is averaging 19 false claims a day, almost five times his average.”“That is impressive,” the host added. “How does he keep up that pace? Does he wear some sort of wrist tracker, the Fib-Bit?”Trump, Colbert continued, is “working on some fresh material”, referring to recent lies about new car plants opening up in Pennsylvania and supreme court justice Neil Gorsuch’s standing at Harvard Law School.“With his tendency to cheat on facts, it’s no wonder Trump’s lawyers don’t want the president to sit down for an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller,” said the host, showing a clip of a Fox News host saying Trump has no reason to do the interview, “knowing that if you tell one lie to Bob Mueller, he’ll move to file charges”.“Well this sounds crazy, but hear me out,” Colbert said. “He could not lie. But his lawyers know that’s not an option.”Colbert then referenced recent reports saying that Trump’s lawyers will allow him to be interviewed so long as he isn’t asked about the firing of James Comey or his conversations with Comey about the FBI’s investigation of Mike Flynn.“Those are the two things that you have to ask!” Colbert shot back. “That’s like saying: ‘You can ask my client Jeffrey Dahmer about anything you want other than murder and dinner.’”Seth Meyers focused on Trump’s web of business entanglements and attempts to avoid an interview with Mueller.“We are seeing a truly unprecedented level of corruption swirl around the president of the United States,” he began. “Rarely in our history have we seen a president so engulfed in scandal. It seems like everyone around him is on trial or under investigation.”Meyers continued: “Some of his closest aides and allies have been arrested, his lawyers have basically admitted that if he testifies under oath he might commit perjury, which is odd given that Trump repeatedly insisted during the campaign that it was Hillary Clinton who surrounded herself with criminals.”In footage Meyers showed from the campaign trail, Trump calls Clinton the “ringleader of a criminal enterprise”.“As we’ve seen over the last 18 months, if anyone’s been running a criminal enterprise, it’s Trump,” Meyers said. “He’s been looting the federal government for as much as he can get while he can get it.”Meyers then showed news coverage about substantial spending at Trump’s Washington DC hotel by federal agencies, Trump’s political allies and foreign governments.“Trump’s lawyers say they don’t want him to testify under oath because they’re worried Mueller will accuse him of perjury,” the host continued. “Although I guess we shouldn’t be surprised Trump’s lawyers are worried about perjury since they themselves have lied multiple times about key details in the case.”In clips Meyers then showed, Trump defense attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow admit to not being familiar with various aspects of the legal proceedings.“It’s not good when your lawyers have the same vibe as a Panera cashier on their first day on the job,” the host quipped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3bce2f4b0e7b015d1907542d957534654041503/559_179_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48ece1a837a4e2c7682072754046d0c7","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A Sumatran orangutan, fireflies mating and a sea lion cooling off in record-breaking Californian heat are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b22f8de2590bbc97587680cb635ea63cde9ffc/0_324_4898_2941/master/4898.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0861452c553beb9b82ce41350caf44","title":"matthew newton steps down eve jessica chastain","story":"Matthew Newton exited Eve after outrage aimed at Chastain for signing on to work with a man accused of physical violenceMatthew Newton has stepped down as the director of upcoming action film Eve, starring Jessica Chastain, after backlash related to his history of violence.Newton, who pleaded guilty in 2007 to assaulting his girlfriend, also wrote the film, which is being produced by Chastain’s Freckle Films along with Voltage Pictures. Chastain, a vocal member of Hollywood’s #MeToo movement and Time’s Up, initially called Newton “wonderfully adept at crafting complex and relatable characters” in a joint statement with Freckle Films’ Kelly Carmichael. But shortly after announcing the film, which was set to begin filming this summer, criticism of Chastain’s decision to work with the director grew.“Yesterday I notified Jessica Chastain and the other producers on the film Eve that I will be stepping down as director,” wrote Newton in a statement. “Since the announcement of this film, the responses, which are powerful and important, have not fallen on deaf ears. I am profoundly aware that I have a responsibility to lead where I have failed in the past. I can never undo the harm that I’ve caused the people I’ve cared about and I carry that shame and responsibility with me every day.”In 2010, actor Rachael Taylor took out an apprehended violence order against the 41-year-old director after accusing him of punching her in the face. After being charged for breaching the terms of the order in 2011 and getting arrested multiple times the next year for resisting officers, Newton received treatment at the Betty Ford Center for alcohol and drug addiction, as well as bipolar disorder. He has also been arrested for assaulting a taxi driver and hotel clerk.“Over the past eight years I have been working extensively with healthcare professionals to help me overcome my addiction and mental health illness,” wrote Newton, who directed the 2017 indie drama Who We Are Now. “For the past six years I have lived a quiet and sober life. All I can do now is try to be a living amends and hopefully contribute to the positive change occurring in our industry.”In an interview conducted earlier this year with Australia’s The Feed, Chastain spoke about ensuring she doesn’t work with abusers on her film sets. “I’ve always made choices, in all the work that I’ve done, to make sure that on any film set that I’m working with people that there isn’t a question about whether or not abuse has taken place,” she said. “It’s very important to me that I practice what I preach, and that my actions follow my words.”After her decision to work with Newton, however, the two-time Oscar nominee fielded accusations of hypocrisy. “I have trouble seeing how she can justify working with Matthew Newton,” wrote reporter Marc Fennell on Twitter. “How does Jessica Chastain claim to be an advocate for women in the industry and has constantly been a part of the MeToo discussion but in the same breath turn around and work with someone who has abused multiple women?” asked another Twitter user.The 41-year-old actor is next set to appear in sequels for X-Men and the horror movie It.

In the devout Christian’s retelling of the greatest story ever told – adapted, per a title card, from Nikos Kazantzakis’ novel and not the New Testament – star Willem Dafoe dared to play the son of God as a mortal, and a flawed one at that. His feathery-haired Jesus had a temper and an ego, defects of virtue that the holier texts would never allow. He speaks in a combination of scriptures and modern vernacular, an odd combination more pronounced in Harvey Keitel’s curly-headed Bronx Judas. Most scandalizing of all, Jesus has a bit of a libido to him, making graphic onscreen love to his wife Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey). At the time, religious groups were up in arms over what they saw as a blithely sacrilegious depiction of the Christ, and Blockbuster Video refused to stock the film.Thirty years later, and the tongue-cluckers have largely won the battle. In the compact realm of explicitly religious cinema, the behemoth known as Pure Flix has flooded the market with morally clear-cut pabulum guaranteed to offend nobody except movie lovers. The likes of The Case for Christ, I’m Not Ashamed and the God’s Not Dead franchise move with a sense of black and white assuredness, dealing in Manichean absolutes from which the good is simply chosen over the evil. They also hold dominion over the box office, while the exceptions to the trend – the recent First Reformed and Scorsese’s 2016 drama Silence – languish in obscurity when not actively losing money. Those disciple films sacrificed a broader audience by eschewing the comforting clarity of organized religion for doubt, challenging their characters’ faith rather than blindly affirming it. They followed the primary teaching of Scorsese’s Jesus: he who claims to know the mind of God is farthest from it.Uncertainty runs rampant through the nearly three-hour sprawl of Christ’s life and times, in turns tormenting and compelling him. Paul Schrader’s script introduces a sinewy Dafoe lugging crucifixes around in his work as a carpenter, effectively collaborating with the Romans in their persecution of the Jews. The radicalized Judas sways his intellectual peer to the cause of the Israelites’ liberation, and even then Jesus falters in his mission. As he sets out on the path of his destiny, he remains committed to his principles of love, compassion and forgiveness above the politicized stance forced upon him. Jesus gets the sense that both sides of this conflict want to make a pawn of him, and he’s torn between wanting to remain unaffiliated in the affairs of men and the clear moral imperative to put an end to persecution. Of course Jesus eventually sides with the rebels, but that doesn’t provide him with any respite from his insecurities and misgivings. He’s eternally at war with himself, his every impulse challenged in his own mind. He’s filled with lust for Mary, and distrustful of the very pleasures of the flesh that he craves. As he screams atop the crucifix, he wants to be a good son and fulfill his purpose on the mortal plane still, he’s confused and frustrated at the set of seemingly arbitrary, incredible steep demands that have been made of him by a God he cannot see. In the most famed departure from the traditional scripture, Jesus allows himself to be fooled by Satan in the guise of his little girl  angel, climbing down off the cross and building a happy domesticity for himself with a wife and child. When he realizes he’s been fooled, the entire story resets itself and snaps back to the moment he made that choice. Crucially, he gets the opportunity to make good – transgression, penance, redemption.That’s the three-part cycle that’s guided much of Scorsese’s work, from Taxi Driver to Silence. He has always treated religion as a philosophical expedition rather than a set of rigid guidelines, and he instills that searching impulse in his daringly imperfect protagonist. He depicts Jesus as something closer to a Christian than Christ, a man constantly parsing and re-interpreting his relationship to God depending on the given situation. The Last Temptation of Christ is a film of questions and not of answers, Scorsese’s confession that the closest any of us can get to godliness is not full understanding, only partially-comprehending goodness. There’s arrogance in claiming enlightenment on Earth, and true humility only in prostration Scorsese communes with God by accepting that some aspects of worship are mysteries and then wondering about them anyway, catching a glimpse of His light in the process of inquisition. Scorsese and his Christ figure collapse in unison at the film’s conclusion (and after 163 minutes of suffering, the audience might be there as well), acquiescing to the will of God without grasping the big picture of the cosmos. Their reward for submitting to the unknowable? Blinding white light, pealing celestial bells and the heaven of the end credits.

Anyone who loves football will of course hate the transfer window, which rather than simply “slamming shut” should instead be abolished permanently along with agents, loan deals, signing-on fees, release clauses, theatrically over-excited men behind lighted desks, people who celebrate transfers as though witnessing some profound human achievement, medicals with hair-gelled men lying on tables doing the thumbs-up with wires clamped to their nipples, want-away aces, stay-away aces, open letters to the fans, car parks, children in car parks, children, cars, one-year deals, three-year deals, running down contracts, entourages, managers, chairmen, players, television, money and people.The good news is that the actual football is finally back. Even without the window it has been a landmark summer for the Premier League’s ability to carry on happening all the time even when it’s not actually happening at all, a substance that froths and surges and bubbles through every gap and hole.Football must always happen now. This has been the great leap forward of the last two decades. Even during the dog days of the summer heatwave it continued to happen. Lay your head down on that desiccated lawn. The noise you can hear isn’t birdsong or the clonk of cricket. It’s the sound of football, of an endlessly wheedling voice Bluetoothed down the line from a motorway service layby, speaking without any real meaning or purpose or end in mind about big money crisis club transfer list agent slur managerial meltdowns.The big losers from this non-season were obvious enough. Clearly José Mourinho is finished, doomed by a non-season during which nothing actually happened or was decided. But during which he did appear in a series of photos in the newspapers looking puzzled and haggard and wearing the type of sad, baggy tracksuit favoured by disgraced celebrities pictured moping outside luxury clinics over headlines like Concern As Frail Ken Vows To Beat Dolphin-Fondling Charge.Pep Guardiola had a predictably great no-football season, shown repeatedly looking handsome and crinkly and astute, perhaps pointing keenly at something just out of shot. And beyond this there was a clear winner in Jürgen Klopp, whose non-season revolved around saying funny things, smiling a lot, and looking as ever like a giant friendly bear in a duffel coat who likes crumpets and lives in a tree stump. What I’m really saying, perhaps you’ve picked it up, is that none of this really matters. Or rather it shouldn’t matter. Even if two things do seem clear as the season kicks off. First, the Premier League desperately needs a proper title race. And second, Klopp and Liverpool are most likely to provide one, most likely to push the Manchester City industrial complex a little harder than last season, which unravelled into not much more than a delightfully watchable lap of honour.It is four years now since the Premier League staged anything like a proper title race. Even Leicester City’s great, giddy triumph was basically a sure thing from Easter onwards. And looking back the last eight seasons have produced just two close finishes – Agüeroooo and We Don’t Let This Slip – and six processions, with the last four titles won by 19, seven, 10 and eight points.It is customary at this stage to point to the robustness and energy of the Premier League, its fine high style. But stasis and certainty is the enemy of sport and increasingly the top two, top six, middle 10 and bottom five all look precooked, subject only to the most incidental variations. This is part of a wider trend. All of Europe’s top leagues were basically a one-team stroll last season, with Serie A the lone exception. The world’s richest club won the Champions League for a third time in a row.This is a structural flaw, perhaps a symptom of the stratifying of resources. It is also why we have begun to talk like this, to linger on all the unceasing un-football, a sport where no one really knows if anyone else is any good anyway, where Arsenal were reduced during the late-Wenger years to an idea, a set of prejudices, an argument on the internet.At which point enter Klopp and Liverpool, who seem the only really credible challengers. Certainly the Premier League needs them right now, needs Klopp’s team to hit the gears from the start, to provide some sustaining narrative tension. Liverpool look strong too, with a front six even more packed with furious ferreting energy. Andrew Robertson looked like the best full-back in the country at times last year, haring up and down his flank like a man being chased by a swarm of bees. Even Daniel Sturridge is back from injury, veteran of that last proper title race and a footballer I’ve always loved watching because of his endearing, inexplicable moments, the way he simply wanders off into weird places on the pitch then makes his own improbable moves from outside to in, like a man trying to run away from his shadow.For now it would be invigorating just to see them get close, in a league that has been sustained over the last century or so years by its feeling of social mobility, of openness and vigour, but which feels at times as though it might be reaching the end of something. Abolishing every part of modern football that stands against this would be a step toward putting it right. But we could always start for now with something that resembles a genuine, white knuckle, fully inclusive title race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09535a5849a60941ed8512a0e412e52b1cdd368/83_109_1053_631/master/1053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93541cfaacb562b81612a85b8c8adfe6","title":"david squires on emo jose mourinhos premier league 2018 19 preview","story":"Our cartoonist puts himself inside a surly teenage version of Manchester United’s manager to look at the season ahead"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/210131a41170b83fcb359d743874faec429896cb/399_33_2172_1305/master/2172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a23fa13882bdaf9a1c375fa09481f0e4","title":"fortnite on android how it works and what its like to play","story":"The smash-hit game of the year is now on Android phones. What will the potential audience of 250m people make of it?During a presentation of Samsung’s latest phones in New York on Thursday night, Fortnite developer Epic Games made its blockbusting online shooter available to hundreds of millions more potential players.The game is now available in beta form on Android devices, though for a couple of days it will be exclusive to Galaxy handsets – and anyone who buys a Galaxy Note 9 and Tab S4 will get access to an exclusive Galaxy skin for their character to wear. After the exclusivity period, owners of other handsets that meet the baseline technical requirements (available at Epic’s Android FAQ), will be able to head to the Fortnite website and sign up for an invite.Downloading (or “sideloading” to use the correct parlance) is straightforward, though with a 1.9gb file size, it is also time-consuming and may be unfamiliar for people who have never bought a game outside the Google Play store, where Fortnite is unavailable. You need to point your browser at Epic Games or go to the Galaxy store, and download the installer, which will require you to switch on the option to download apps from unknown sources.This process works differently depending on what phone you have (and handsets running the newer Oreo OS have a more rigorous security system built in), but if you do make changes to get hold of the game, it is a good idea to go back and reverse them as soon as you have finished downloading, or you may leave yourself open to malicious software.Once you are in, you will be able to access any Fortnite account you have already set up either on Epic Games or on PC, Xbox, Switch or PlayStation (if you do not have one already, you will need to sign up, which is free, but also time-consuming). The game works cross-platform (apart from with PlayStation) so you can, in theory, play on your Android phone against console gamers – though, considering the compromised control set-up, this is unlikely to end well.Fortnite works the same way on Android as it does on iOS devices – through an initially confusing array of onscreen virtual controls. Movement is via a circular “joystick” in the bottom left, which works fine until you are in the heat of battle and forget exactly where it is in relation to your thumb, leaving your character stranded and vulnerable for a few precious milliseconds. There aresmaller icons for jumping, firing the gun and selecting an item, which are sensibly placed, but a bit fiddly for people with small displays and big digits.Thankfully, there are lots of helpful aids for touchscreen users, including autorun and an autofire option, which will automtically trigger your current weapon if there is another player in your sights. You also get visual prompts if there is a treasure chest nearby, or if there are gunshots or footsteps in your vicinity, making up slightly for your comprised spatial movement.The game runs smoothly on our test handset, a Galaxy S8, with no lag or juddering, even in the more demanding 5050 mode where you have two giant teams fighting it out in the same area with a lot of onscreen shooting and explosions. Playing for an hour or so does drain the battery rather significantly though, and some users have reported issues with the handset heating up, which is not something we experienced.Overall, it is the same experience as the iOS version, and as good as a mobile interpretation of a fast-paced PC and console shooter can get without support for a bluetooth controller (which is coming, according to Epic’s chief executive, Tim Sweeney). While it was once rare to find thoughtfully designed mobile versions of big gaming hits, the market is changing.“Recently, a number of console games have been redeveloped for mobile,” says Patrik Wilkens, vice-president of mobile at Spil Games. “Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds are seeing great success at the moment. Minecraft is a constant in the Google Play Store top paid apps, while games like Civilization VI, GTA: San Andreas and Final Fantasy Brave Exvius are doing well.”“Porting to mobile opens up new audiences, even in markets where console versions of those games have been successful. Partly this is about reaching the device players have in their pockets. Partly it’s about developers spreading risk by using multiple direct channels.”The important test for the global success of Fortnite will be how well it runs on lower-end devices, which are more prevalent, especially in new gaming markets such as India, which is second only to China in terms of app downloads.If it copes, Epic has got itself a very significant new platform. “While the Android market does not tend to monetise as well upfront as Apple, there are amazing examples of highly successful games,” says Oscar Clark, a mobile industry consultant at Fundamentally Games.“It’s already free-to-play, the value proposition is already understood by the audience and a lot of hardcore players are Android users. So it comes down to performance on lower end devices … if it works well across the range we might see Android revenues equalling or even exceeding iOS.”Fortnite has been downloaded more than 125m times on its various platforms, but now Epic Games has estimated that the game is playable on about 250m current Android handsets. It seems we are only at the beginning of the Battle Royale phenomenon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81c74421697c5223e99abb54a0c65cabbeb9653c/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1152942205ddecd2a96045b9fb13cf1","title":"win a weekend away at a premier inn anywhere in the uk and ireland","story":"Enter this prize draw for your chance to head to the UK destination of your choice with accommodation courtesy of Premier InnWhether you’re a family hoping to explore somewhere new and different, or friends seeking somewhere off the beaten track, if you’re the lucky winner you can choose a destination from over 750 hotels across the UK and Ireland.You’ll be able to enjoy the soundest sleep on luxury Hypnos beds, a seriously tasty all-you-can-eat breakfast and a delicious dinner at our restaurant.

One guy even brought his own parmesan grater! These days, I’m not sure what class I am. I know I grew up skint – proper skint: free school meals, social housing, keeping the windows closed in case the bailiffs get in – and the experiences of those years still preoccupy my mind. I know I’ll never inherit anything (unless you count diabetes) and as your common-or-garden debt-laden millennial, I suspect ever owning any assets is out of the question.But a few years ago, I stopped going into my overdraft every month. I no longer needed a payday loan to cover financial gaps. I landed a professional job. Some of the people I worked with went to private school. I bought theatre tickets. I stopped throwing my cheese rind away. I bought cheese that had a rind. That constant, gnawing fear of running out of money – the thing that keeps you working every hour under the sun – was growing weaker.In fact, my friends from school now call me “posh spice”, presumably because I went to uni and because I’m Asian, although if I must have an Asian-themed musical nickname, I always preferred Chapatti Smith. Happily, my family still keep me grounded. We still gift each other necessities for occasions rather than desirables (“Happy Birthday, Mum – I got the washing machine fixed”).Anyway, the point is, I am (probably) middle class now. And can I say, it’s a bit of all right absolute result, actually. I’m still getting used to it. I don’t know if it will last for ever, but while I’m here, I’m giving it both barrels. Bring me your gilets and TV shows about gardens! Bring me your unessential Essentials range at Waitrose! And in this spirit, this week I did the ultimate middle-class thing: I went camping in France.“It’ll be cheap,” my friends promised. Believing that was my first mistake. Especially when this brand of camping is less about being at one with nature and more about creating a smaller version of your existing house. Some people had electricity, others a hanging pantry and one guy even brought his own parmesan grater! I knew the middle classes liked having multiple properties, but I didn’t think the summer tent counted.I had fun, sure, but what’s the point of a portable hammock when there’s an epic castle nearby to spend time in? Who needs a blow-up pool when there’s an actual lake next door? If anything, some of those adults there could learn a lesson from me: just because it costs more, doesn’t mean it’s better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd5681ff1f596b9c56abad97f1707189ea06a93/1087_700_5982_3590/master/5982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d2774963016a5d22d2d6030d70f9116","title":"offering something people didnt get meet gal dem team","story":"The gal-dem collective is disrupting traditional media – all from their tiny HQ in a London car park If you wanted to find a kind of ground zero for gentrification, you could do worse than here: an office block carved out of a concrete multistorey car park in south-east London that now fizzes with the cumulative energy of dozens of startups. Yellow “Ahead Only” signs still mark the lanes that link digital media companies with eateries whose lunch dishes are garnished with labneh and almonds.The bigger businesses have garnished their parking spaces, too, with pot plants and deckchairs. But I have scaled these levels to find gal-dem, the award-winning online magazine run by women and non-binary people of colour. By contrast, its HQ is squeezed into a minuscule space about the size of one car parking spot. Their occupation here is an ambivalent one, both physically and metaphorically. The gal-dem journalists inhabit the space lightly – a few shelves and A1 magazine covers the only gesture towards permanence. There are few other people of colour working here.What gal-dem lack in space, they make up for in energy. As I enter the tiny newsroom, I find four women – none older than 25 – sitting at their laptops in a row, facing a chipboard wall, the conversation darting casually around what seem to be everyday subjects in gal-dem lan. Liv Little, the magazine’s founder and editor-in-chief, looks suitably playful for an architect of media subversion, wearing a deep blue jumpsuit and running a hand casually over her shaved head.“I was in Deptford market and a glass of wine there costs £6 now!” laments Niellah Arboine, gal-dem’s lifestyle editor, seated regally at the end of the long desk, with sleek braids and distinctive lime slice earrings.“But was it delicious though?” Little probes cheekily.“Yes!” Arboine confesses, laughing. “And, apparently it doesn’t give you a hangover, because it has so few sulphites it in.”Little is both excited at the prospect of securing a major US star for the forthcoming annual gal-dem print cover, and aware of how much the whole process is costing her. “I’ve been chanting every morning that we get her,” she says, describing herself as a practising Buddhist. “I had to go through three inner circles, and those phone calls to the US are expensive!”The team have previously interviewed everyone from Oprah and Lupita Nyong’o to British musician Ray BLK the fact that such famous women are keen to collaborate with gal-dem, while the editor-in-chief frets about the price of the phone calls required to arrange the next star, is a marker of the reality of life at this major media disrupter.Little, who is 24, grew up in south-east London, with Guyanese and Jamaican families, and a friendship group representative of the erse area. When she went to study politics at the University of Bristol she struggled with the all-encompassing whiteness her student experience entailed. “I had never been confronted with racism until I went to Bristol,” she explains. “It was overwhelming and I was stressed. You become woke.”Little met Leyla Reynolds, who as art director at gal-dem has helped build the magazine’s reputation for standout graphics and illustrations. Then a fellow politics student at Bristol, Reynolds was frustrated at the, as she saw it, lack of interest of university staff in her chosen dissertation topic, the political contribution of black British art in the 1980s. The final straw for both women, it seems, was the joint experience of taking a class on feminism, only to find it taught by, as Little describes him, “this white man”.“We thought, ‘We know so much about feminism, what is he doing?’” Little recalls. She began posting on message boards about connecting with others in Bristol and beyond who were also dissatisfied with the lack of ersity on campus and on the syllabus.Registering the domain gal-dem – “it sounded like the most natural way to describe a group of my peers” – Little and Reynolds began growing a network. They highlighted some of their favourite articles from publications they admired under the hashtag #sixtysassydays (a name that now makes them cringe). “I had this idea – we were just sharing content that we liked for 60 days before we launched,” Little says. “It was a good way to build up a bit of a network.”Little now disparages gal-dem’s first incarnation (“Such bad social media!” she exclaims), but it worked, attracting attention among other women and non-binary people of colour in Bristol, including Antonia Odunlami, whom Little and Reynolds met at a networking dinner in the city. Together with Odunlami, now music editor at gal-dem, they began brainstorming on how to grow a passion project that was still in its infancy, along with the confidence in themselves.Along with that confidence came their first event – an informal get together in a London coffee shop, where people who were interested could come, as Little describes it, “for a really chilled meetup”. It was here that they first encountered Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, now gal-dem’s deputy editor, whose writing on her experiences of using Tinder they had already read, and admired.Only three years later, this group of young women, which now includes more than a dozen editorial staff and numerous regular contributors – many of them with almost no prior professional or media experience – has shaken up the mainstream press. They give a glimpse, alarming for some, of a future in which the white, male perspective will not monopolise. “What we are offering is something people didn’t get before,” Little says. “As women and non-binary people of colour, people assumed that we all had the same thoughts, or the same upbringing. And we are showing that there are so many different perspectives within these very broad categories.”Pieces such as The Virginity Paradox I Face As A British Muslim, in which the writer Sara Jafari questions her commitment to no sex before marriage as a feminist or The Vagina Affliction More Common Amongst Women Of Colour, on how women of colour are more prone to bacterial vaginosis (which can “really piss on your chips, side eye your sex life, or kill your confidence”), are just two examples of how qualitatively different gal-dem’s offering is. The scale of gal-dem’s current – never mind future – plans are dizzying. Reynolds, wearing a floral dress, her dark brown hair streaked with blond, speaks proudly of a project the team recently created, a commemoration of Windrush at 70 in collaboration with the mayor of London at his office in City Hall. “It was a three-part thing: a Caribbean kitchen installation, 12 absolutely incredible portraits of black British Caribbean women from Windrush to now, and a series by the artist Rochelle White, who creates huge photographs of Caribbean food dishes and places them against these luxe backdrops.“We have this collective amnesia about the impact of Caribbean women in the UK,” Reynolds says, adding that she is hoping the Windrush exhibition will now tour the country, visiting schools and community spaces. “We need to make sure this stuff has a legacy, rather than a moment.”Soon after we meet, gal-dem will launch Rewriting The Canon, a literary course in conjunction with the London department store Liberty, repositioning writers of colour, whose legacy is so often overlooked. The demand has taken everyone by surprise: during the day I am with her, Little spends most of her time preoccupied with the dilemma of more people having subscribed than can actually be accommodated.Then there is a forthcoming gal-dem book, and a collaboration with the Afropunk festival. All this adds to gal-dem regular events, gal-dem Sugar (club nights and museum takeovers at which the team fill the usually quiet spaces of museums with installations, films, talks, DJs and all-round partying) and commercial projects that have so far included collaborations with Red Bull, Asos and Nike. Little is also signed to the model agency Storm, and has appeared in Vogue for a feature entitled Meet The New Suffragettes.Corporate gigs provide some financial relief from the unpaid work of the gal-dem magazine itself, but are not without hazards. “It’s hard,” Little concedes. “The boundaries are constantly shifting. The way media and brands and advertising are set up, it’s against people of colour. To find those brands that are not part of that, or that have a good ethos, they are few and far between. We say no to loads of stuff.”I join today’s four-strong gal-dem team for lunch at a Jamaican cafe inside the nearby market. It’s run by a no-nonsense Rastafarian who seems to have found a happy harmony between the black traditions of pre-existing residents in this part of London and the new influx of clean food-loving hipsters. While eating our chickpea curries, roti and dumplings, we talk about the memories associated with certain foods the experiences of queer people of colour, and the dilemmas of coming out to family elders. It’s another reminder of how personal the issues that make up so much of gal-dem’s published material really are reflecting the complexities of navigating sexuality, race and class. The magazine runs content that deals frankly with the daily struggles these identities entail, such as My Sense Of Home Shifted When I Came Out, about the sadness of having to create distance with one’s family and Why We Need To Dispel The Myth That Ethnic Minorities Are Aspirational By Default, challenging the narrative that it is white working-class boys whom society is leaving behind.For Daisy Ifama, who grew up in a small town in the West Country where she had cleaning and dinner lady jobs at her own school, while still a pupil, studying at Goldsmiths in London exposed her to class elitism. “I just didn’t know that lots of private school people went to university,” says the gal-dem video editor. “My teacher was like, ‘Put your hands up if you didn’t got to private school’, and only I and my friend put our hands up. I had never been friends with someone who had gone to private school before.”Arboine says she grew up “in a very multicultural, beautiful bubble, where I was used to learning about all these amazing black people”, only to experience the shock of racism at university in Aberystwyth. “I had never felt so othered in my life.” Reynolds moved from London to Suffolk at the age of 11. “I had been at primary school in the city of London, in an insanely multicultural area, then I came to Ipswich and people were like ‘Because you’re a bit black, you’re quarter cast.’ And I was like, ‘That’s not OK.’“I remember crying once when someone said the N-word in a joke,” Reynolds recalls. “And people saying, ‘It’s fine, black people aren’t being killed any more’, and stuff like that. It all has an impact on how openly you talk about race.”Little, meanwhile, went to private school, the result of her mother’s determination to provide her daughter with the best education she could. “My mum is a very hardworking woman who nearly killed herself to pay for my education,” she says. “She found a way to make stuff work. I’ve always worked, too. When I was at Bristol, doing my dissertation, I was a nanny, I was also working in a burger restaurant. My hair started to fall out because I was really stressed. We have all pushed ourselves to extremes to do this.” There’s a sense among all the team that this was both an incredibly tenacious choice, but also not really a choice at all, so certain were they it had to be done.Gal-dem attracts the audience it does, and the brands desperate to resonate with that audience, because of what’s often described as “authenticity”. But the gal-dem team see it in less grandiose terms, as being true to their own experience. One of the magazine’s most popular features was Arbione’s Letter To My Younger Self: Your Body Is Yours And Yours Alone, which she – and thousands of others, it seems – still turns to now. “I was in this weird limbo part of my life. It just started out as a letter. And then it just kept going and going.” The letter is searing and sweet, but painful, too. “In the nicest way possible, you look a bit like one of those Lego men. Your hair was never meant to be straight and that’s all right,” Arbione writes. “There’s no right way to be black… black is who you are, not what you do.”This honesty is a simple commitment, and gal-dem will not be apologising for the success it has delivered. “At the beginning, when you get offered loads of stuff, you are gassed and feel really privileged,” Little says. “Now I feel like these institutions are really privileged to have us in their space. And that is the biggest piece of advice I give to anyone now when I speak: know that you are so valuable. What you have, they don’t have. And that’s refreshing.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e62b64e70670c9f839d4cbc465c74f771b4f4a/0_0_4000_2662/master/4000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77a0ea2ac1e9578ebf41a8b3958533d7 1400w","title":"campaign for second brexit vote seeks support beyond capital","story":"People’s Vote roadshow will try to show public that remainers are not part of establishmentCampaigners for a second referendum will hold the first of a series of events outside London on Saturday to try to mobilise popular support for the plan beyond the capital.The Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Vince Cable, and Labour’s Stephen Doughty will address a lunchtime event at the Colston Hall in Bristol, where tickets have sold out.Organised by the People’s Vote campaign, it will be followed by events in Edinburgh, Newcastle, Cambridge and Cardiff before culminating in marches to coincide with the Labour party conference in Liverpool and the Conservative conference in Birmingham.A local doctor and a 20-year-old gardener will be among those speaking in Bristol, as the organisers try to show that those in favour of Britain staying in the European Union no longer represent the establishment – an elitist charge that was successfully used by the Brexiters during the referendum campaign.A source at the People’s Vote campaign said the organisation wanted to try to “give voice to millions of people who feel the establishment has screwed Brexit up over the past two years” and argue that “the likes of Michael Gove are the establishment now”.However, there has been a resurgence in activity by Conservative hard Brexit campaigners, who are unhappy at Theresa May’s Chequers compromise proposals, under which the UK would share a common regulatory rulebook with the EU on food and goods after leaving the EU.A new online campaign, Stand Up 4 Brexit, which supporters say is in favour of a clean Brexit, has rapidly grown in support in the past week, winning the endorsement of pro-Brexit MPs such as Priti Patel and Ben Bradley.Paul Everitt-Clay, a Tory activist, said: “We are encouraging people to speak out and reject the Chequers plans. They amount to a removal of every single one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines, because we will be making ongoing payments to the EU, still be bound by its rules, and reintroducing free movement by another name.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e900aa0722215e086422a228b901b92c009f80/0_1_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49435e036dcae4ecd398a500475149d2","title":"tented britain rise in rough sleepers taking shelter under canvas","story":"UK may not have tent cities like US, but encampments have become feature of British lifeSun-bleached food packaging and the fading remnants of a campfire are the only clues that people used to live in woodland near Cardiff Bay. Residents nearby said the homeless men living in Hamadryad Park had left shortly after Aaron French-Willcox, 19, was found cold and unresponsive in a tent at an encampment in the early hours of 13 February.French-Wilcox, who had type one diabetes and died from diabetic ketoacidosis, started living in one of the three tents at the site after he was reportedly caught taking the synthetic cannabinoid spice at a homeless shelter three weeks before his death. “He didn’t belong out here,” said a Cardiff rough sleeper who knew him. “He was a nice guy. Goodhearted. Just a decent 19-year-old.” The teenager was one of a growing number of homeless people in temporary and semi-permanent encampments throughout the UK, in what has become an increasingly common fixture of British life, living underneath bridges, clearings in woodland and quieter corners of city centres. The official rough sleeper count in England – widely considered a big underestimate – has strict rules about what constitutes a rough sleeper. People living in encampments are not necessarily included in the 4,751 people who bedded down outside overnight in 2017. The government is expected to release its strategy for tackling street homelessness within the next few days. The strategy aims to halve rough sleeping by 2021 and eliminate it by 2027.In the past year, encampments of varying sizes have been reported in cities and towns including Bristol, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, Manchester, Oxford, Sheffield, London, Northampton, Cambridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Glasgow and Exeter.Police and councils are often quick to try to break up encampments and move people on using enforcement orders and public space protection orders (PSPOs).In the centre of Slough, eight homeless people camping outside a Catholic church have been issued with a notice to vacate by the local diocese. A church volunteer told local media that members of the congregation had complained about the encampment and said the group were “intimidating”.Last month, 10 police officers broke up a camp on the banks of the Severn near Worcester Cathedral where about half a dozen rough sleepers had been living. Days later, former camp members were reportedly seen sleeping rough in the city centre. Homeless encampments are also entering popular culture. For the first time in the soap’s 57-year history, Coronation Street is running a storyline on homelessness in which the longtime character Sean Tully experiences cashflow problems and ends up living at a homeless camp underneath railway arches. Matt Downie, the director of policy at Crisis, said: “People living in tents and cars and squats and various different forms of homelessness should just be viewed as part of the homeless population. To a large extent, the problem should be viewed as simply another form of rough sleeping.“It’s true that it’s an underrepresented group. We are pretty confident that the numbers of people experiencing those forms of homelessness aren’t picked up, particularly in the rough sleeping statistics.”Downie said a future in which US-style tent cities become a normal part of life in the UK would be “unimaginable”, but warned that more and more people would be forced to live on the streets and in encampments unless government policy changed.Last summer, Milton Keynes hit the headlines when more than 60 tents were pitched in underpasses and on the streets, many inhabited by low-wage workers, former soldiers and people with mental health issues. Milton Keynes council said it has since had success in housing the town’s rough sleepers. It said the number had fallen to just under 50, with 14 tents still standing in July. The council credited a partnership between homelessness organisations, police and other services to help house people, using charities with existing links to rough sleepers to get people into emergency accommodation. Peter Marland, the leader of the council, said higher rents and government cuts were the main drivers of the encampments. “A lot of this is to do with service cuts, whether that be the NHS, the police, some council services, those support services that were previously there if you had a drug or alcohol addiction,” he said.“With austerity, we’ve seen a lot of those services go away because homelessness had seemed to go away, but obviously what a lot of those support services were doing is keeping people away from being homeless.”At the start of the year, the Labour council launched a housing first scheme, which offers rough sleepers long-term secure accommodation alongside support services, which Marland said had helped get more than 50 people off the street. “Milton Keynes in a way is different. We’ve overtaken Liverpool and Sheffield in terms of our economy size. In becoming a big city, it means you get big city problems,” he said.“Quite early, we ruled out PSPOs. We didn’t want to criminalise the act of being homeless. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says: ‘I’m going to live in a tent.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1223159b7d9f7233c0dba0f7a04a5e44c3189792/0_88_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8475352ce8055ea4ac5f40fc3d565e3e","title":"uk government should restrict gambling ads seen by children industry says","story":"Growing consensus within UK betting sector that there is too much pre-watershed TV advertising Senior gambling industry figures have admitted concerns that children are being exposed to too many betting adverts on TV and have called on the government to act. The growing consensus among of industry bosses prompted calls from Labour for the government to crack down on “out of control” gambling ads.Philip Bowcock, the chief executive of William Hill, said: “Some sort of change is needed, but that has to be led by government. It’s incumbent on them to step up to the plate and have a serious discussion about it.”He has previously said he is “sympathetic to some sort of curb or ... review around the level of advertising”.Paddy Power Betfair said this week that it was “supportive of further regulation ... to reduce the volume of pre-watershed TV advertising to protect young children”.Gambling adverts are permitted before 9pm in the UK, as long as they are attached to live sporting events such as Premier League and World Cup football.By contrast, Australia has banned betting commercials accompanying live sports coverage and Italy has banned them altogether.Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair, said he was open to tougher limits on the volume of ads but that it was “difficult for the industry to do this on its own”.Jackson added: “Even if progressive operators agree to restrict ads, unless there’s legislation passed, less responsible operators step in and continue advertising.”In its recent triennial review of gambling regulation, which focused largely on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said it would not act to restrict TV advertising because of a lack of evidence it was causing harm. But critics of this stance have pointed to the absence of large studies into the influence of gambling ads, particularly on children. The charity GambleAware has commissioned research into the subject, but it will not be ready until 2019.Simon Thomas, the chief executive of London’s Hippodrome Casino, said the government should err on the side of caution.“There are valid concerns with regard to the exposure of children to a high number of gambling adverts, particularly where they are linked to glamorous activities or high-profile role models such as Premiership footballers or professional cricketers,” he said.“Where children are concerned, we need to set a lower threshold of risk and be more prepared to employ the precautionary principle.”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: “The gambling industry has rarely been united over issues of social responsibility – so when operators are openly admitting that the level of gambling advertising has become a problem, we have to take it seriously.“Gambling advertising on sports fixtures in particular is out of control. International research suggests that children and young adults in particular are increasingly targeted and exposed to gambling messages.”Watson said the government had “avoided taking the action needed and continued to rely on out of date evidence”.In practice, companies such as William Hill and Paddy Power have the least to lose from a crackdown on ads because they are much better known than smaller firms seeking to build a brand.Some smaller gambling firms, and broadcasters such as Sky and ITV that derive revenue from gambling ads, played down the effect on children in their submissions to the DCMS review.But Dr Heather Wardle, a gambling behaviour expert from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it was easy to underestimate the impact.She said the true effect on children may not become clear for years: “It’s hard to prove what harm is being done because it’s a generational thing and the harm comes much further down the line. We’re creating the conditions that normalise gambling for a generation.”Research by the  during the World Cup found that ITV’s coverage of the tournament featured 90 minutes of gambling ads.Other research has found that gambling ads during the World Cup may have breached advertising regulations introduced this year prohibiting commercials that “unduly pressure the audience to gamble”.Researchers from the psychology department of the University of Warwick said 63 “live odds” adverts, which display time-limited offers, “may have encouraged viewers to gamble impulsively”.The Advertising Standards Authority is understood to be considering whether some live odds promotions breach its code of practice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60a5fbcc1a1fd8fc48eda6b1bb7d81333f6167/0_338_1329_797/master/1329.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c79bb5d4fda7c381a59cc340e69490","title":"nine year old chess prodigy told he can stay in uk shreyas royal home office reverse","story":"A nine-year-old chess prodigy has been told he does not have to leave the UK when his father’s work visa expires, a move that has been welcomed by MPs and chess organisations in Britain.Shreyas Royal has lived in the UK since he was three but was told he would be sent back to India when the work visa expires in September.On Friday, his father, Jitendra Singh, said he had received an email that morning, informing him of the Home Office’s change of mind.“They just emailed me and told me they had considered my case and we are allowed to extend our leave to remain on tier 2 general route,” Singh said.“We are very happy and Shreyas is very happy. He jumped up on the sofa when he heard the news. I want to thank all those who helped and supported us ... I would also like to thank the Home Office and the home secretary who considered our case.” The news was also welcomed by the English Chess Federation, which has been campaigning for the boy to remain. Dominic Lawson, the ECF president, said: “We ... are delighted that our efforts to persuade the government to recognise Shreyas Royal’s exceptional talents have borne fruit.”Lawson’s words were echoed by Leon Watson, the secretary at Battersea Chess Club, where Shreyas is a member. “This is an enormous relief.” he said. “Shreyas is a very nice, down-to-earth young man who has a big future ahead of him.”Shreyas, nicknamed Shrez, was described by Chris Ward, a chess grandmaster and former British champion, as “the best prospect the country has ever seen”.He started playing chess at six, eventually becoming the world’s youngest “candidate master”. In August 2017 he was ranked joint fourth in his age group at the World Cadets Chess Championships in Brazil. In his short time playing he has won multiple awards.Shreyas’s parents, Jitendra and Anju Singh, moved to south-east London from India in 2012. They have been staying under a tier 2 long-term work permit, but were recently told that the only way they could stay would be for Jitendra Singh to renew his visa. To do so he had to earn more than £120,000 a year.The couple appealed to the Home Office on the grounds thattheir son was a national asset, but received a letter earlier in the month saying that while he showed “immense promise” it did not mean he could remain in the country.The decision was originally challenged by MPs who urged the Home Office to reconsider. Labour’s Rachel Reeves, a former junior chess champion, and Matthew Pennycook, MP for Greenwich and Woolwich where Shreyas lives, wrote to two cabinet ministers urging them to let the boy stay.The email received by Singh on Friday read: “As advised during the call we have spoken to your employer ... and have agreed with them that you will be able to submit an application to extend your stay in the UK under the tier 2 (General) route.“I would be grateful if you could let me know once the applications have been submitted so that I can ensure that they are processed smoothly.”The Home Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ea34bda12dfbc7e9a933b810e1efaa09dcd9b2/19_684_4681_2809/master/4681.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7613c94ddbeefe220dbb092ffbc129a","title":"england v india second test day two live","story":"27th over: India 75-6 (Rahane 18, Ashwin 8) By the standards of the cricket we’ve seen so far, an uneventful over, Rahane and Ashwin taking a single each from Curran. 26th over: India 73-6 (Rahane 17, Ashwin 7) Five slippers for ol’ Johnny Big Swing, but his first two balls move too far for Ashwin to get anywhere near, then an absolute snorter goes past the edge by the width of some tracing paper. Ashwin drives again, this time getting plenty on it - enough, that is, to send it to the boundary, even if it did go in the air for a good while. A couple more edges, neither of which carry, and this is pretty bloody good bowling by Woakes. 25th over: India 69-6 (Rahane 17, Ashwin 3) On closer inspection, that might not have been a drag-on, which gives you some idea of how far it swung. Ashwin is the new bat, and he plays a lovely drive first up to get off the mark, hauled in by Woakes to save a run, but Rahane goes one better with a tuck off his hips that Rashid can’t stop at fine leg. “If I see the England team, indeed any team, playing football before a game rather than practicing slip catching I swear I’ll do time,” why-I-outtas Olly. In fairness, they’re catching them eventually...A man in at short cover as Curran comes in at Karthik, but no fielders are needed as the young lefty pitches one up, it swings in late, late, late and the stumps are clattered via - I think - a flick of an inside edge. 24th over: India 62-5 (Rahane 13, Karthik 1) Six men in the slipsgullies, and an edge straight away from Karthik, if short of the man at sort of fifth slip. “I think we should put the Lord’s ground staff in charge of arrangements for a no deal Brexit,” suggests Kim Thonger. “If they can clear that amount of water off the outfield in that short time they can deal with any amount of congestion at Dover.”Drop! Then a wicket! a repeat of what came before: Pandya goes hard at a cover drive, edges and Buttler gets nowhere near it at second while Jennings didn’t even move at third slip. Then, the very next ball, Woakes turns Pandya inside out and, as if guided by some sort of cosmic craving for instant redemption, gives Buttler a fairly simple, if lowish catch. 23rd over: India 57-4 (Rahane 13, Pandya 7) Whoosh, how has that one missed? Pandya goes for a loosey loosey drive to an in-dipper from Curran, gets a big inside edge and it misses the stumps by an inch or so, on its way to the boundary. The batsmen then nearly run into each other going for the first of a couple of more intentional runs. 22nd over: India 49-4 (Rahane 12, Pandya 0) Pandya survives the remaining two balls, but not by much, keeping out a full swinger from the boy Woakes. That’s terrific bowling and excellent concentration in the slips. The ball before Kohli made a very late decision to leave one from Woakes, it turned out to be too late and the ball glanced off the face of his bat. Buttler went down to his left at second slip, but missed a tricky chance and it squirts through for four. But next up, Kohli tries to flick one through the on side, Woakes gets it to shift just enough and a thickish leading edge goes to Buttler again, who pouches with no drama. HE’S OUT! 21st over: India 44-3 (Kohli 19, Rahane 11) Sam Curran replaces Jimmy Anderson. Rahane, who is looking more like himself after a difficult Test at Edgbaston, pushes pleasantly through mid-off for three. There’s some encouraging inswing for Curran in his first over, who ends the over by angling a nice lifter past Kohli’s outside edge.And with that, I’m off into the night. Nick Miller is your man for the last hour of play. You can contact him on nick.miller@the. Thanks for your company and emails, bye.20th over: India 39-3 (Kohli 19, Rahane 7) Kohli edges Woakes this far short of Pope, ing to his left at gully. It’s a brilliant over from Woakes, in which he also beats Kohli twice outside off stump. Woakes has figures of 2-2-0-0, and they don’t flatter him.19th over: India 39-3 (Kohli 19, Rahane 7) Kohli squirts Anderson square for a couple, ignores a few tempters outside off stump and steals another sharp single on the off side. He is playing admirably, both in his approach and execution.“Good evening Rob,” says Jonathan. “I hope I’m not alone in realising how lucky I am to enjoy listening to Messrs Holding and Sangakkara on telly for the last 30 minutes. Everything commentary should be and nothing that it shouldn’t.”Yes. Sangakkara has somehow managed to be both predictably brilliant and a revelation.18th over: India 36-3 (Kohli 16, Rahane 7) Chris Woakes replaces the underwhelming Stuart Broad. Woakes took 11 wickets against Pakistan on this ground two years ago and starts here by slipping a big outswinger past Rahane’s outside edge. That’s the highlight of an excellent opening over.“A few members of my cricket club – CIPACC, the (hilariously nerdy) Chartered Institute of Patent Attorney Cricket Club – have been following this thread during the rain breaks and suggested I write in with my hat-trick tale…” begins James Duffy. “We were playing the Treasury at the Civil Service Playing Grounds and were strolling to victory, so the captain invited me to bowl the final over with my occasional ‘leg-spin’. My first three balls were slogged for 10 runs, leading to the retirement of the batsman on strike (for reaching 25 runs). Three balls left in the game. In and out comes their No9, bowled first ball No10 was then stumped. The no 11 walks to the crease, fielders crowding the bat. Half the team were wishing me encouragement a more vocal half, comprising the usual suspects including the captain, were praying against a wicket and CIPACC’s first-ever hattrick.“I proceeded to bowl a rank long-hop, bad enough that the slips were immediately in hysterics - but the batsman was so determined not to get himself out that he played a forward defensive down entirely the wrong line and, on the second bounce, watched in horror as the ball trickled past his bat and bowled him. The disbelieving batsman dragged himself from the field, having been dismissed, by our team’s consensus, by the worst hattrick delivery in history. (The following week, I took a wicket with my first ball, so in effect took four in four balls.) The match report is here to prove it.”Am I the only person in the world who hasn’t taken a hat-trick?17th over: India 36-3 (Kohli 16, Rahane 7) Kohli squeezes Anderson square on the off side for a couple. It’s a good contest, if not quite as unmissable as Edgbaston. Anderson tries the surprise straight one later in the over, and Kohli flicks it crisply along the floor to midwicket. 16th over: India 34-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 7) Broad has an LBW appeal against Rahane turned down - too high, maybe going down - and then Rahane is sent back by Kohli after setting off for a dodgy single. A maiden.15th over: India 34-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 7) Beautiful bowling from Anderson, who beats Kohli with consecutive outswingers. The first was fuller, inviting the drive the second, a little shorter, moved in the air and off the pitch to snap past the outside edge.14th over: India 34-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 7) Kohli and Rahane have been admirably positive, particularly in their running between the wickets. There are four quick singles in that Broad over, all of which have an element of thievery. That’s really good cricket.13th over: India 30-3 (Kohli 12, Rahane 5) This session might not be the expected orgy of wickets for England. The ball isn’t doing as much as it did this morning, and these two are India’s best batsmen overseas. Kohli looks comfortable - he’d look comfortable batting on crazy paving - and Rahane has started pretty well with the exception of that one loose drive.12th over: India 28-3 (Kohli 11, Rahane 5) Rahane is dropped by Root at fourth slip. It was a sharp chance to his right as Rahane launched into a loose drive, and it looked like Root was beaten for pace. Kumar Sangakkara, commentating on Sky, thinks the slips are standing too close.“Controversial proposition: Curran should be bowling instead of Broad,” says Phil Harrison. “He’d hit a fuller length, get more swing etc.”You’re wrong. That’s not controversial at all.11th over: India 22-3 (Kohli 10, Rahane 0) A full, swinging delivery from Anderson is timed sweetly through extra cover for four by Kohli. He has some luck later in the over when he inside edges a defensive push just wide of leg stump.“Re Richard’s Mark Robinson story, I’m worried by the following scenario,” begins Gary Naylor. “The batting side need one off the last ball to win a limited-overs match. The batsman is hit on the pad but the bowling side do not appeal, as their position would not be improved by an out decision - match tied. The batting side do use their last review because the non-striker has spotted a no ball and knows that it will win them the match - but only if reviewed. Can the batting side call a DRS review against themselves? And if not - why not?”Don’t take this the wrong way Gary, but did you know there’s a whole world out there?10th over: India 16-3 (Kohli 4, Rahane 0) Broad has four slips for Kohli, who is hit on the top of the thigh by a nipbacker. It’s not the greatest over from Broad, with Kohli working the last ball off the hip for a single. That means he’ll be on strike against Anderson.9th over: India 15-3 (Kohli 3, Rahane 0) Jimmy Anderson has three balls of his fifth over remaining, with five slips for the new batsman Ajinkya Rahane. The first ball zips past the outside edge, of course it does - and the next two are defended solidly.The players are on the field, the sun is out. Nothing’s gonna stop us now.“YAY!” says Phil Harrison. “That drainage never ceases to amaze. If they can get Kohli early, England could be batting tonight.”The groundstaff have worked like beasts to get the ground fit for play. The sun is out, and play can continue until 7.30pm.Play will restart at 5.10pm! “As a 12-year-old, bowling on the roll-up matting at school, I took a wicket with my first ball of the over followed by two dot balls,” begins Simon Thomas. “Next up a (much) slower ball, leading to another wicket, followed by another next ball up. That’s three in five balls. Final ball of the over and my hat-trick ball was popped back to me for the easiest C\u0026ampB in history. And I dropped it. Think Mike Gatting’s drop against India for its sheer awfulness. The Head made me stand in front of the whole school the next day and catch a series of balls lobbed at me at various speeds, the sod.”This is a wonderful triviagasm from Richard O’Hagan“The current England Women’s coach Mark Robinson was once stumped off a wide - but the wide call meant that although he was out, Sussex also won the game.”The umpires will now inspect at 4.50pm. An inspection being brought forward? It’s anarchy out there. Won’t somebody think of the playing regulations?“I saw that Chris Old over from the Rea Bank Stand with my father and sister,” says Mike Daniels. “I remember how lithe Wasim Raja seemed when he bowled. Chris Old - reputed to be the only man who needed a runner to open the bowling. Good bloke though.”And scorer of the best 29 in English cricket history. “You would think that the third (if not the second!) victim of an all stumped hattrick might recognise there could be some mystery spin going on and maybe not advance quite so far down the wicket first ball,” says Steve Tayler. “Related to that, I once heard that Robin Marlar went in as nightwatchman, and was caught on the boundary. Second ball. For six. Can anyone confirm?”Yep, that one is true – this was the game.“All this hat-trick chat reminds me of the heady days when, in my fourth year at university having just finished my finals, I took four wickets in four legal deliveries for my college first team,” says James Beard. “We’d been pummelled for the preceding 35 overs, so as a (theoretically) non-bowling no.11 (my level iswas resoundingly college seconds beer cricket) I was delightedapprehensive to be tossed the ball. What followed was two wickets in two balls, 5 wides miles down the legside on the hat-trick ball, and two more wickets with the next two balls. I seem to recall that two of the wickets were also stumped, somewhat remarkably.”Stumped off wides, I hope.“I took a hat-trick for Guildford 2nd XI back in the early 80s,” says Chris Wright. “That week’s Surrey Advertiser’s back page had a big bold headline, Hat-Trick Hero. I thought, ‘Wow, they are really going to town’. Turns out it was a piece about some local racing driver and the report on my game was on the inside sports page and somewhat less effusive (‘Wright’s 4-31 included a hat-trick’, as I recall).”There will be an inspection at 5pm I won’t lie to you, I’m not getting my hopes up.Abhijato Sensarma writes in with the story of the greatest over in history. Either that or he is Walter Mitty in disguise. “Once, I was officially the worst bowler in my school,” he says. “Thirteen years old at the time, it made no difference to anyone, since everyone sucked but played anyways. I came on and sent three consecutive wides down leg. Then, two batsmen got out on consecutive deliveries by trying to hit the ball – which miraculously landed on the same good length - over my head and into the hands of the same fielder near the boundary. I bowled two wides outside off and took another wicket the same way.“The sixth wide, over the batsman’s head, followed. The fourth wicket came the same way as before. The fifth legitimate delivery of the over was dropped, but not disheartened, I got the least powerful batsman out caught while slogging. The team was dismissed, and the over was the strangest anyone on the field had ever witnessed. That was my day of glory, and while I did not get a hat-trick, it was a five-wicket over nonetheless!”“Also not on YouTube,” says Richard O’Hagan. “Chris Old’s four wickets in five balls at Edgbaston in 1978 - an event also overshadowed by David Gower’s debut and Iqbal Qasim being hospitalised by a bouncer.”“Hi Rob,” says Nick Brereton. “Continuing that hat-trick theme can I give some much-needed recognition to my pub team Oddfellows (named after the North Shields pub)? We were on the receiving end of an all-stumped hat-trick a couple of weeks back against Belmonte CC of Durham. According to our league secretary, the only time this has happened in first-class cricket was in 1895 - so it makes us some kind of world beaters. (And Belmonte as well I guess!)”Weather update It has stopped raining. The problem is that the outfield is a bog. Never mind the Indian batsmen it’s the Super Soppers that have some dirty work to do. This might be my favourite hat-trick: in 1972, Pat Pocock took five wickets in six balls and seven in 11. But it’s not on YouTube, so I’m not sure whether it counts.Thanks Nick, hello again. Let’s proceed straight to some hot hat-trick chat.“Hi Rob,” says James. “As a 14 year old I played for my dad’s village team. We where a good few runs up so clearly the captain felt comfortable bringing me on. My first ball disappeared over the boundary but my second, a rank full toss, was hit vertically and caught by the keeper. The new batsman promptly hit another full toss back over my head and holed out to deep mid-on. On a hat trick the new batsman came out, went for a push and got himself run out. Technically not a hat trick but I felt pretty chuffed with myself until my next two balls (awful half-trackers) disappeared for a 4 and a 6. I was withdrawn after the over and never asked to bowl again - my career figures read 6, W, W, W, 4, 6 and an average of 8. I still claim it as my only hat trick as well.”And with that, I’ll hand over to Rob Smyth for a bit. Get him on Rob.Smyth@the. The sun’s out now. Weird thing, weather, innit? “When playing in the minor SW LondonSurrey borders leagues, we often used players as umpires,” writes Julian Menz. “I once gave a team-mate out LBW (in my defence he was the last batsman in) when he was hit on the shoulder by a full-toss. My excuse? There was a football World Cup game going to penalties in the clubhouse, and I fancied a pint.”Not that it matters a huge amount now, but they’ve officially taken tea. The lesser spotted ‘underwhelming hat-trick’, from Nic Baddeley here: “As a 13 year old spinner in a 20 over school match, I took two wickets in the first two balls of the second over of my spell. Our captain, the wicketkeeper, quickly proceeded to bring the field in as I was on a hat-trick. At this point my PE teacher, who was umpiring and scoring, spoke up and said that I had taken a wicket with the last ball of the previous over and had in fact already completed the hat-trick. Everyone still came up and patted me on the back, but I have to say it was all a bit underwhelming in the end.”It’s now raining so hard that there’s an inch of standing water in some parts of the outfield. If this was a few years ago they’d call this off right now, but with modern drainage they will stick around for a bit. But...let’s just say you shouldn’t exactly settle in on the sofa. A little more hat-trick fun: this was in an ODI, but Chaminda Vaas took one with the first three balls of a World Cup match in 2003, against Bangladesh. I think he enjoyed it.Can anyone beat this as the longest break between two wickets in a hat-trick, from Chris Moore? “I took a hat trick by taking the last two wickets with the last two balls of the season, and then taking a wicket with the 1st ball of my first over two years later!”(Of course it isn’t actually a hat-trick, but you know what I mean)Oh for eff’s ess. It’s raining again, so you can stick that 3.30pm restart up your jumper. Let’s have some answers to those quiz questions, then. Nobody got them all right, some people got a few right. 1) It was the first ever hat-trick comprised only of left-handers. It might also be the first to end a Test too, although I haven’t double-checked that.2) Those two hat-tricks were split over two innings. 3) Phil DeFreitas, Darren Gough and Devon Malcolm. 5) In men’s cricket, the answer is Bangladesh’s Sohag Gazi. But as the ’s own Raf Nicholson pointed out, Betty Wilson did it for Australia against England at Melbourne in 1958. Particularly impressive given her century was in the second knock, when the Aussies had managed just 38 between them in the first. We have a restart time: 3.30pm BST. No word on when they’ll take tea just yet. The covers are off, but the hover cover is sticking around over the bowler’s run up at the Nursery End because there is a bastard of a big dark cloud still looming over the Grandstand. Groundsman Mick Hunt is waving his arms around a bit, Aleem Dar (of course looking odd without his hat on) looks at his watch.Answers in a minute, but Richard O’Hagan writes, on the issue of hat-tricks: “Can I nick (no pun intended) your idea and ask if anyone has, like me, taken a hat-trick and not realised it? It was in a 20 over school game. As I was the quickest bowler in the team I used to bowl overs 2, 4, 18 and 20. I took a wicket with the last ball of over 4 and the first two of over 18. It was only much later that anyone spotted what I had done.”Shall we have a quiz? Or, more specifically, nick a quiz from our friends at the Nightwatchmen (buysubscribe here), on hat-tricks? Here are the questions, if you promise not to Googlelook at the replies on the tweets. Email your answers in, I’ll post the answers just after the next inspection at 3pm BST."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b76bd9831eb718e5fb9001fc63d5a99497de06b/105_379_3659_2195/master/3659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e844407d448f1d60aa7d8a3337fb62fc","title":"us pga championship 2018 second round live","story":"Koepka keeps pace and is now outright third behind Kisner and Woodland after birdieing the long par-five 8th, sinking a five-footer. He’s reached the green in two on his final hole, so could well end up -9 in the clubhouse. Speaking of NBA stars, Steph Curry shot a 1-over 71 on Thursday in the first round of the Web Tour’s Ellie Mae Classic. 71. Let that sink in for a minute. Spieth plays to the middle of the 7th fairway off the tee, but puts way too much backspin on his approach and it rolls back off the front of the green. Rose, in the bunker again, duffs one out about 50 yards. He’s livid! Rahm is the only one of our marquee group that hits aKisner is one hole ahead of this group, and a birdie on the 7th from 11ft has given him the outright lead. He’s -10 now, with Woodland only able to par the same hole. Andre Iguodala, NBA champion with the Golden State Warriors, is making a guest appearance in the commentary box. He favours the three wood off the tee, just like Tiger. The two are good friends. Find a pal that looks at you the same way Tiger looks at Andre. Those kicks, too! Woof. Thanks Scott. Spieth is scrambling alright, and he’s got another birdie chance at the par-three 6th. It’s a long-one down the hill, he pushes it left and makes his par, as does Rahm. Rose splashes into the bunker on the left but gets up and down for his par to stay at -5. Tidy. Jordan Spieth thinks his second into 5 has been held up by the wind, and complains loudly to his caddie accordingly. But he’s wrong: the ball lands six feet from the cup! In goes the birdie putt, and he’s -2, that career-slam dream not over this year yet! Meanwhile it’s just a birdie for DJ on 8, but he’ll take it, because that gives him a share of second with Brooks Koepka at -7.And with that, I’m off to eat a bowl of Hamburger Helper, the only MSG-flavored foodstuff to be marketed by a talking golf glove. We’ll meet again soon, but for now I give way to your friend and mine Michael Butler!Bogey for Emiliano Grillo at 16. As he slips to -4, Francesco Molinari passes him the other way with birdie on 7. The Open champ returns to -5. Meanwhile an eagle chance for Dustin Johnson on the monster par-five 8th: after a 340-yard drive, he’s crashed his second from 257 yards to 18 feet. This could potentially cause a bit of fuss near the top of the leader board.Brandon Stone, out first thing this morning, is back in the clubhouse. The Scottish Open champion has signed for a two-under 68, which pairs very nicely with yesterday’s 66. He’s -6, in a rich vein of form right now, and will very much be looking forward to the weekend, with plenty of time to rest until he goes out tomorrow. He’ll be teeing it up reasonably late you’d think.It took all that time for Justin Rose to finally make it to -5 it’s taken one hole for him to slip back. His tee shot found sand down the left of the long par-four 4th his second was swallowed up by another bunker, guarding the green front left. He can’t get up and down, and he’s back to -4. Still only five shots back, of course.Gary Woodland slips back into a share with Kevin Kisner. His drive down 4 finds the rough on the right, and though he manages to make the green, he’s a long way from the flag. Three putts were almost inevitable. Bogey, and he’s -9 again. Emiliano Grillo makes another birdie, this time at 14, and he joins the ever-expanding group at -5. Francesco Molinari drops back, though bogey at 5 sends him down to -4. Zach Johnson birdies 3 namesake Dustin birdies 7, his fourth in five holes. And it’s three birdies in a row for Charl Schwartzel: that’s five in six! This is quite the leaderboard. Goodness knows what awaits us when the afternoon wave come out.There’s some absurd scoring going on right now. Ted Potter Jr. has just holed out from the fairway at 14 for eagle: that follows birdies at 3, 11 and 12. After a 74 yesterday, the 34-year-old Floridian - who has only made the cut once in seven attempts in the majors, at the 2012 Open - rises to -1. Meanwhile another birdie for Justin Rose, this time at the short par-three 3rd, taking an aggressive line at a flag near the water on the right, and reaping the reward for a perfectly executed shot. He’s -5. His playing partner Jon Rahm gets to -4 after landing his tee shot pin high, ten feet from the flag. And Adam Scott birdies 6: he’s -5 for both round and tournament.Dustin Johnson has just pressed on the accelerator! Birdies at 3, 4 and 5, and suddenly the world number-one is right back in the mix. His namesake Zach birdies 1 to return to -5 as well. And back-to-back birdies for Charl Schwartzel at 10 and 11 - that’s four in five holes - has the former Masters champ enter the fray too. This is turning into quite a championship already, with a couple of solid Tour players up top, hoping to make their breakthrough, hunted down by quite a few major winners!Gary Woodland completes his overtaking manoeuvre on Kevin Kisner. He sends his tee shot at the par-three 3rd to four feet, and strokes the birdie putt into the cup. There’s some low scoring out there today, further evidenced by Andrew Landry: this year’s Texas Open champion has just made four birdies in a row between 13 and 16 throw in another at 11 and he’s risen to -2 for the championship after a 73 yesterday. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Rose at 2, and he’s back to -4. He’s been unable to get any lower this week: a short par three coming up!That lead is held jointly by Gary Woodland and Kevin Kisner, the former making birdie at 2 to grab a share. A wee bit back down the leader board, Emiliano Grillo is quietly making a move. The 25-year-old Argentinian has long been tipped for big things, but his record in the majors lately has been little short of appalling: he hasn’t made a single cut since the 2017 Masters. But he’s just birdied 7, 8, 11 and 13, and unless he’s got a very special meltdown heading his way, he’ll be here for the weekend. He’s -4.The double US Open champion Brooks Koepka makes it three birdies in a row: 1, 2, 3. That’s six in the last nine holes, and this 28-year-old Floridian is going to rack up a fair few majors if he can avoid injury. He’s got the necessary length, his short game is tight, he battles, and rarely seems flustered. Koepka, Spieth, DJ, JT, Fowler, Reed ... Europe have got a job on their hands at this upcoming Ryder Cup, haven’t they. Anyway, Koepka is -7 now, two off the lead.Russell Henley is fighting hardest to avoid missing the cut. A miserable 74 yesterday, but birdies at 5, 7, 9 and now 14 have catapulted him up the standings to level par. Tommy Fleetwood might yet save himself too: a birdie at 2 brings him back to +1, just above the current projected cut line, whatever illustrative purpose that might serve. But big Chris Wood is going the wrong way, and quickly: bogey at 1, followed by a double at 4, and he’s slipped to +4. A disappointing showing after a decent Open Championship.Kevin Kisner birdies 18! He’s played the back-nine holes in 29 strokes, and hits the turn leading the 100th PGA Championship! Up ahead, Brooks Koepka and Francesco Molinari both birdie 1. And back down 18, Rose overshoots the green with his approach, and can only flop back up the hill onto the fringe. His attempt to save par bobbles, and that’s a bogey that drops him to -3. He looks highly irritated, having changed his mind about which club to use from the fairway that’s cost him. Spieth however wedges to 15 feet he’ll have a look at birdie. But he can’t make it, his putt drifting off to the left. He remains at -1, eight off the lead.Bubba Watson is seriously struggling as well. He played the back-nine holes in 38 today, turning after a double at 18. Throw in another bogey at 2, and he’s +4 for his round and the championship. The 2010 runner-up looks like he’s off home early. The 2013 winner Jason Dufner is in bother too: he’s currently +3 and needs something along the closing stretch. The Masters champion Patrick Reed is certainly fighting for his weekend participation: birdie at 1 has bumped him up to +2, and at least he’s heading in the right direction. Tommy Fleetwood’s hope of a maiden major this season is beginning to look like a pipe dream. A double-bogey at 18 - the result of driving into thick rough, then taking three putts - has been followed by another dropped shot at 1. He’s +2 for the tournament, and as things stand, missing the cut by one stroke. A long way to go before we know too much more about that, of course. Meanwhile Dustin is going backwards again: bogey at 2, and he’s -2. His brief co-leadership of this tournament yesterday suddenly feels a long time ago. Bogey for Francesco Molinari at 18 he’s turning in 33, and back to -4. Back-to-back birdies for Patrick Cantlay, at 7 and 8 he’s -4 too. Birdies at 7 and 8 bring Charl Schwartzel up to -3. And smiles all round on the 18th tee, as Justin Rose mishits, but somehow sends his ball down the centre of the fairway anyway. “That’s a pretty miss, isn’t it?” Rose quips, after dropping his club mid-swing, to much laughter from the gallery. Now, can he take advantage of that stroke of luck?The 17th continues to stage some top action. First up, Spieth lands his approach six feet past the flag and nearly spins it back into the cup. Instead it goes six feet past. But in goes the saver. He’s 23 from 25 inside ten feet, and remains -1. Rahm meanwhile leaves a chip well short, but rattles in the 25-footer he’d left himself. Finally a birdie to break the run of pars! He’s -3. And Rose’s second takes a hot bounce through the green and nearly rolls into the hazard at the back. But it stops, and he gets up and down for a birdie that brings him back to -4.This may explain the momentary rage that descended upon the normally calm Jordan Spieth: in the group ahead, Gary Woodland made eagle at 17! He creamed his second from 260 yards to five feet, and tidied up for his reward. His playing partner Kevin Kisner made birdie. So that’s created a bit of separation at the top. Brandon Stone is trying to keep on the leaders’ tail with birdie at 4.A rare display of Spiethian funk! His drive went into the hazard, but not quite into the water. It’s snagged in a thick bush. So he goes to great effort to pick it out ... then spins through 180 degrees and pitches it baseball style into the drink! It’s wet now. Once the red mist disperses, he drops and hits three down the fairway. He’ll need to get up and down from distance with his wedge. That’s something he couldn’t manage yesterday.Just like yesterday, Spieth sends his drive at 17 into the creek running down the right of the fairway. That’s a clumsy error after making birdie at the previous hole. Up ahead, Brooks Koepka makes his third birdie of the day. He’s right in the mix now at -4. Dustin Johnson birdies 18, cancelling out the bogey he made at 15. He’s still -3. And belated news of Tyrrell Hatton, who birdied 7 and turned in 32 strokes he’s -2.Jordan Spieth finally gets into red numbers! He fizzes an iron straight at the flag at the long par-three 16th, and rolls in the straight 15-footer he’d left himself. That’s only the second birdie of the day on this hole: the first was made by Brandon Stone, who had hit an almost identical tee shot. Spieth is -1, and for the first time this week will be thinking about launching a challenge for that career-slam-completing major. Jon Rahm very nearly curls in a 30-footer for his birdie, but yet another par will have to do. He is beginning to look frustrated, having hit a few decent putts without enjoying any luck. Meanwhile another birdie for the Chilean prodigy Joaquin Miemann, this time at 13. He’s -4.Rahm nearly holes out from the bunker at the front of the green par will do after that drive, though. Yet another par. He’s -2. Rose is in cabbage to the right of the green he chunks his chip and is left with a 15-footer for par. Nope. He’s back to -3. And Spieth rolls his putt straight at the flag ... but doesn’t give it enough juice. He draws his putter back, high into the air, miming to whack the ball off the green in frustration. He earns a laugh from the gallery, then taps in for his par. He stays at level par. Meanwhile Kevin Kisner, in the group before, had birdied the hole ... and hit the front on his own as a result. Birdie for Zach Johnson at 14. And another for Adam Scott on 18 he turns in 31, and with that long putter hot for once, is now a serious contender.Turns out Spieth doesn’t have to craft the ball right to left as much as Tiger did yesterday. He’s got an opening in front of him, and a fairly straight line to the green from 220 yards. That’s a stroke of luck, and he’s a past master at (a) taking advantage of good breaks, and (b) getting himself out of trouble with his outrageous talent. He lashes a long iron straight into the heart of the green, and leaves his ball pin high, 12 feet from the flag! That is so sweet. Spieth’s wholesome apple-pie image sometimes obscures the fact that this is how Seve used to carry on: driving like a lunatic yet somehow manufacturing escape after escape. He’s so entertaining to follow. Rahm meanwhile can only flash out into greenside sand, while Rose misses the green from the centre of the fairway. So Spieth, whose drive was by some distance the worst, is the only one in the group with a chance of birdie. That’s golf!Spieth and Rahm spray wild drives down the left of 15. Trouble there: that’s where Tiger tried yesterday to recreate Bubba Watson’s outrageous Masters-winning hook from the trees ... and failed. Elsewhere, Matt Wallace birdies 18 to hit the turn in 31 strokes he’s zipped up the standings to -3. Adam Scott has added to those early birdies at 11 and 13 with another at 17: he’s -3. The 19-year-old superstar-in-making Joaquin Niemann follows yesterday’s fine 68 with birdie at 11: he’s -3. And beware Brooks Koepka, lurking, waiting to pounce from the pack. He’s birdied 13 and 15 to move to -3. At this rate there’ll be more top-of-the-leaderboard action soon, I’ll be bound.Jordan Spieth pulls at a straight uphill 15-foot birdie putt on 14. He lets his head drop as a chance to get into red figures for the first time in this championship is spurned. Jon Rahm faces a similar putt, with maybe a little right-to-left movement. He leaves it high on the right and it’s been all pars today for the 23-year-old Spaniard. But Justin Rose teases in a right-to-left birdie curler from nine-and-a-half feet. That’s 18 out of 19 from inside ten feet this week, a fairly big reason why he’s now -4, just a couple off the lead! Meanwhile Brandon Stone makes his second bogey of the week, at 1, and suddenly the top of the leaderboard looks a little different:Gary Woodland makes his first bogey of the championship since the opening hole yesterday. A three-putt bogey at 14 drops him back into a share of the lead at -6 with Brandon Stone and Kevin Kisner.The new Open champion keeps on keepin’ on! Francesco Molinari birdies 14 to rise to -5, a shot off Gary Woodland’s lead. Meanwhile the morning marquee group of Spieth, Rahm and Rose are steadily making their way along the back nine Spieth’s birdie at 11 apart, it’s been an uneventful string of pars.Another birdie for Kevin Kisner. This one comes at 13, his third in four holes. He’s -6, tied for second with Brandon Stone, a shot behind Gary Woodland. Kisner is a fine example of the thin line between bridesmaid and bride at top-level professional sport. In a parallel universe somewhere, he’s won the play-off at the 2015 Players, beaten Bubba Watson in the final of this year’s WGC Match Play, and held onto his 54-hole leads at last year’s PGA and this year’s Open. That’d be a serious haul. It wouldn’t take much more. But as it is, after a series of near misses, the resilient but luckless 34-year-old South Carolinian has to make do with wins at the 2015 RSM Classic and the 2017 Dean \u0026amp DeLuca Invitational. Yes, it’s a thin line all right. If he finally lands a big one this week, you can’t say he hasn’t been knocking on the door.Everyone’s favourite golfing hothead, Tyrrell Hatton, is all smiles this morning. Birdies at 1 and 3, and the entertaining heart-on-sleeve Englishman, who tied for 10th in the 2016 PGA at Baltusrol, rises to -1. Hatton’s also got a top-five finish at the Open on his CV, when everyone was playing in a different tournament to Henrik Stenson and Phil Mickelson at Troon in 2016, and a sixth-place at this year’s US Open at Shinnecock Hills. It’s only a matter of time before he gets seriously involved at the business end of a major. There’ll be some fine drama when he does.Zach Johnson is out, and he’s immediately bogeyed 10, the result of sending his drive into the thick stuff down the left. He slips to -3. We’ve not been going long, but already this leaderboard has a radically different look to it.Brandon Stone waited seven holes for his first birdie today. So of course he makes another at the following one. He picks up a stroke at the long par-five 17th: he’s a shot off the lead! Meanwhile the first eagle of the week has been made by Satoshi Kodaira. A two at the driveable par-four 11th. There were no eagles yesterday, the first time a day’s gone by at the PGA without one since 1983. Kodaira, having finally made one, naturally bogeyed the holes before and after. But that, ladies and gentlemen, is golf.Plenty of positive scoring this morning. Beautiful conditions and a receptive course. The 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel birdies 1 and 2 to move to -2. The 2013 Masters winner Adam Scott birdies 11 and 13 to rise to -2. Another birdie for 2012 Players champion Matt Kuchar, this time at 14. He’s -2 as well. And on 11, the 2015 Masters champ Jordan Spieth wedges to six feet and makes his birdie to move back to level par. He’s now made 18 of his 20 putts this week from inside ten feet.Another birdie for Francesco Molinari! This time at 12. The Open champ moves alongside Zach Johnson in a tie for fifth at -4. Meanwhile Marc Leishman, who has come close in a couple of Masters and three Opens, looks to make a mark on the PGA: birdie at 13 and he’s in the group at -3. But it’s all happening at the very top! Kevin Kisner, who came so close at Quail Hollow last year, and went even closer at this year’s Open, opens with birdies at 10 and 11. Brandon Stone breaks his run of pars with birdie at 16. And the overnight leader Gary Woodland is out, and he’s birdied 11 as well. All of which means ...Our featured group this morning stars Jon Rahm (-2), Justin Rose (-3) and career-slam-chasing Jordan Spieth (+1). It’s a horror start for Rahm, in the blood-curdling movie sense: he flays his opening drive miles into the trees down the right. His ball ends up on the fairway. But how? By clanking off some poor punter’s head, that’s how! The poor chap is splayed out on the ground, having a towel pressed to his bleeding head, by the time Rahm arrives on the scene. Looking extremely embarrassed and very apologetic, Rahm signs a glove, and crouches awhile to offer the man some support. “I hope you have a good round!” smiles the man, which is awfully nice of him. It’s a sweet scene, and one which earns Rahm some warm applause. Rahm seems a little shaken by events, and leaves his approach well short, then chips to 15 feet. He finally gathers himself by knocking in the par saver to stay at -3. Rose pars without fuss, while Spieth gets up and down from a bunker to save his par too. Stuff happening everywhere except on the scoreboards.Brandon Stone is now level par for his round through 14, his first five holes. He remains at -4, a couple off Gary Woodland’s first-round lead. Matt Kuchar birdies 11 and 12 to undo the damage he did coming home with those bogeys at 15 and 17 last night. But it’s a fast start by Matt Wallace of west London (but schooled in Alabama). The 28-year-old Englishman is making his PGA Championship debut this week, but he’s won twice this season on the European Tour already, in India and Germany. He’s birdied 11, 13 and 14 to move to -2.Only five players have ever done the Open-PGA double in the same year. Sir Walter was the first: Hagen did it in 1924. Seventy years later, Nick Price matched the feat. Padraig Harrington won them back-to-back in 2008. Rory McIlroy achieved it as well in 2014. And of course Tiger’s done it twice, in 2000 and 2006. What price Francesco Molinari joining that elite group? He was slow out of the blocks yesterday, +3 through the first six holes, a right old Claret Jug hangover. But five birdies after that gave him a fine opening round of 68. And he’s opened today with birdie at 10. Don’t rule the in-form 35-year-old out: he’s -3. Italy waited a long time for its first major championship do the buses in Turin behave like the ones in London?It’s going to be another warm day at Bellerive. Sunny, some clouds, with temperatures over 90 degrees come the afternoon. Not much in the way of wind. But there are worries that some thunder and lightning may arrive mid-to-late afternoon. Fingers crossed that’s not the case. The good news is that the weekend is set fair: slightly lower temperatures, but plenty of sun, and no storms a-comin’.Kyle Stanley was sniffing around the leaders midway through his round yesterday. The 30-year-old from Washington state made it up to -3 at one point, but dropped a stroke on his way home. He’s continued that slide today: bogeys at 1 and 2 have sent him clattering down the standings, back to level par.Here we go then, my oldPreambles are so Thursday.

This page will be updated daily throughout the festivalA delight in doodling is at the heart of this inventive escapade for the over-threes from Korean company Brush Theatre. Our mischievous hosts, Youngkyun Yeom and Seungeun Lee, are wearing matching costumes – white T-shirts, black trousers and braces – and armed with marker pens and big imaginations. First, the duo invite us to sketch pictures of them on mini whiteboards, then they draw our portraits and we become characters in their show. Before long, they are animating their scribbles and smudges on a huge screen to create a nautical adventure. There’s a twinkle in both performances and in the jaunty keyboard accompaniment, too. CWWriter and performer Katherina Radeva lives between two places: the Bulgaria of her birth and the Britain she has called home for years. In Fallen Fruit, she journeys back there and then to the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, in the dying days of communist power. The show weaves together Radeva’s childhood recollections of 1989 with her parents’ memories, the story of two family friends and the complex upheavals that rippled through the continent that year. CLRead the full three-star reviewA kids’ show that captures the magic of cookery with cracking eggs, a shower of flour through a sieve and the irresistible smell of a cake baked on stage. This tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is framed by the storyteller’s own preparations for her daughter’s 16th, and her memories of family birthdays give the show a lovely, wistful air. Danyah Miller quickly establishes a rapport with the young audience, inviting plenty of participation. If the puppets by Little Angel don’t have the wow factor of some of their other creations, they are appealing in their ingenuity, not least the colander cat. CWThe future Gary McNair imagines is a raggedy one, worn down and patched up with dodgy stitches. In 2042, when the NHS has long been dismantled and patients are charged for doctor’s appointments by the minute, most people can’t afford medical treatment. With sad warmth and dark humour, After the Cuts tests how far we’d go to save the person we love, anaesthetic or no anaesthetic. KWRead the full four-star reviewEver left kids alone to clean up their room and returned to find it twice as untidy? That’s the setup for the Australian company Hoopla Clique’s raucous circus show in the Piccolo tent. Two brothers – one shock-haired, the other floppy-fringed – are ordered to put away their toys, but within five minutes they’re hurling balls at each other, breaking out backflips and wielding homemade weaponry that sends toilet paper streaming every which way. Derek Llewellin and Julian Roberts’ sense of fun is infectious and their high-energy pranks thrill – and occasionally appal – the young audience. The result is a mess that, mercifully, you can leave someone else to tidy up. CWThe sharp-suited Valentijn Dhaenens cuts a convincing figure as a slippery, ambitious politician. The show opens with a speech bloated with metaphors and empty of content. It’s familiar stuff, eliciting wry laughs from the audience. Later, we see him talking strategy, giving statements to the media, making video calls to the family he barely sees, and sending regular, occasionally explicit missives to his lover. It recalls his performance in Ontroerend Goed’s Fight Night, another show about how we vote for the who rather than the what. CLRead the full three-star reviewFifteen junkshop chairs enter the stage: half are pushed on in a rickety procession by one dancer, the others are piled high and given an unwieldy piggyback by her partner. They are precisely placed around the space, creating an obstacle course for the duo, who discover unexpected worlds of play with these props. There’s plenty of mischief and gentle humour in this sophisticated show for the over-threes from Belgium’s Compagnie Nyash, choreographed by Caroline Cornélis and deftly danced by Miko Shimura and Colin Jolet. A sophisticated, spellbinding show for children that deserves to be seen by all ages. CWRead the full four-star reviewSuch is cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat’s following, there are plenty of child-free audience members to see him hatch his first family show. Whether they’re taken from Willy Wonka, The Lion King or the Pussycat Dolls, the songs he has chosen to cover – as in his grownup set, Icons – feel both personal and universal as they celebrate fun, fantasy and pride. Riffing on Hans Christian Andersen, this is the tale of a duckling who doesn’t quack and kick in quite the right style for a feathery circus troupe. There is some sparkle here, and a sprinkling of audience participation, but the show isn’t afraid of darkness – not least in its lugubriously lit and exquisitely designed set. You’re left savouring not just the singer’s voice – warm and deep enough to bathe in – but also the elegant drawl of Tommy Bradson’s narration. CWJoke that you’re “the nation’s favourite comedy rap-jazz duo” and you’re bound to recall “New Zealand’s fourth most popular folk parody act” – as if it weren’t hard enough already for musical comedy duos to escape Flight of the Conchords’ shadow. But Harry Baker and Chris Read have made waves over the last year (Radio 2 appearances guest slots on Russell Howard’s show on Sky) with their brand of peppy comic song. Provided you put Conchords comparisons to the back of your mind, their latest fringe offering makes for a pleasantly erting hour. BLRead the full three-star reviewBy rights, a verbatim report of a 17th-century court case should be no more compelling than one that happened last week. Yet the reverse is true in Breach Theatre’s tremendous three-hander evoking the 1612 trial of Agostino Tassi, who was accused of rape by Artemisia Gentileschi, a gifted baroque painter, who was 15 at the time of the alleged attack. MFRead the full four-star reviewThe trick to writing a monologue is finding a reason for a character to speak. If they are alone, what motivates them to address us? Katherine Parkinson has a novel solution. Making her playwriting debut, the IT Crowd and Humans actor takes us into an artist’s studio where three models of different generations are posing. Sharing the stage, they speak out of embarrassment. Their words spill forth to fill the void. MFRead the full three-star reviewArmed with glitter, songs and a diagram of her vulva, Fran Bushe is on a mission to kickstart her own libido and change how we think and talk about female pleasure. After trying to enjoy sex for 15 years and facing unhelpful advice from GPs, she is taking matters into her own hands. Though, of course, it’s not that simple. She wants a quick fix, a happy ending. Much of her solo show is about how life and sex don’t work that way – and all of this is surprisingly funny. We might finally be having more sophisticated conversations about consent, but Ad Libido makes it clear that we need to go further. CLRead the full four-star reviewJust the Tonic at the Tron, 3.40pm, until 26 August“The reigning queen of New York’s live storytelling scene,” trumpets Jon Ronson from Sara Barron’s publicity. Odd then that For Worse isn’t a storytelling show, but no-frills standup addressing sex, marriage and new motherhood. It’s good too, although given the raucous subject matter and bar-room environment, it might fly higher in an evening slot. Barron misses few opportunities to flout propriety, waxing ambivalent about parenting, heaping scorn on other couples’ sweet nothings, and going dewy-eyed at the memory of her “two dicks in a day!” sexual peak. The brand of brazenness on show feels quite familiar, but this UK-based American carries it off with verve. BLThe Britain’s Got Talent star Lee Ridley’s new show, Inspiration Porn, is more political and vulnerable than anything you’d expect to see on the same TV programme as Simon Cowell. It is a distinctive mix of barbed disability comedy and self-mocking humour, in which Ridley caustically mocks the inspirational rhetoric that surrounds high-achieving disabled people, contrasting “yes we can” Paralympic mottos with the realities of his own life: lazy, lonely, he tells us, and “shit at everything”. The entwining of private and political is adroitly done, and Ridley’s call-to-arms to fight, not for heroic inidual success a la Britain’s Got Talent, but for social justice is – irony of ironies – inspiring. BLRead the full three-star reviewAn award-winner at the Brighton fringe, this amusingly ramshackle two-hander recasts female ageing as a mythological quest. Armed with an invisibility cloak (a beige M\u0026ampS cardie) and tongue sharpener, off set Emma Edwards and Abigail Dooley across the sea of apology and the bridge of tears, on a mission to slay ageing itself. Directed by Spymonkey’s Toby Park, Edwards and Dooley have gleefully improper fun mocking the expectations of fiftysomething femaledom, as clownish prop-comedy splices with confessional moments about growing old. It’s so DIY as to teeter, like the middle-aged body, forever on the edge of collapse, and the pace sometimes lags. But its up-yours spirit is as infectious as the don’t-take-yourself- too-seriously message it so cheerfully exemplifies. BL “I’m the bisexual daughter of a Catholic deacon. And I’ve got OCD.” So Catherine Bohart introduces – and sums up – her textbook fringe debut, Immaculate. The brand of OCD from which Bohart suffers is called perfectionism, which you might have guessed from the scrupulously accomplished nature of her show. Never less than meticulously, she wins our trust, sets up her character and themes, spins the plates awhile before closing in on a heart-warming finale (with obligatory comic sting). It’s a mite schematic. But Bohart is great company, milking her obsessive compulsions for featherlight laughs, and the tale she tells – of her parents’ courtship in repressive 20th-century Ireland of daughter and dad learning to love one another’s queerness and Catholicism – is elegantly told. BLDenim, the queens of subversive late-night drag cabaret, put on an afternoon kids’ concert in which they clean up some of the content, keep the inclusive message and lose none of their wit or glamour. For the over-fives, what’s not to like about a quintet with fabulous frocks, megawatt smiles, glittery facial hair and a gift for make-believe? They treat the cosy Piccolo tent as if they’re playing to 80,000 of their biggest fans. Aqua’s Barbie Girl becomes a slow jam (“Life in sequins, it’s got new meanings!”), Cyndi Lauper’s anthem is rejigged for the school run (Mothers Just Want to Have Fun) and Let It Go has seldom sounded so empowering. By the time they’ve given some of the kids a drag-queen makeover and mashed together Miley Cyrus and Bon Jovi in the closing medley, the bond between performers and audience feels just about unbreakable. CWThis collaboration between Scottish director Al Seed and Australian choreographer-dancer Lina Limosani is a richly crafted theatrical tapestry that cleverly questions notions of destiny and female agency. It transposes the three Fates of Greek mythology (who spin, measure and cut the cloth of life) from antiquity to a bleak cosmic sweatshop. Nigel Levings’ gloomy green-tinged lighting enhances the uncanny atmosphere, while Guy Veale’s strange electronic soundscape mixes bassline thumps with the insistent bleeps of some mythic morse code. AWRead the full five-star reviewAt first sight it’s just your average bright-red halterneck jumpsuit, but the shiny H on the waist gives her away. Writer-performer Kate Kennedy plays superhero Hunch, whose gift for gut intuition gets her recruited to join the ranks of those protecting the metropolis of Hum (she takes the office next to the loo in the super-HQ). Directed by Sara Joyce, DugOut Theatre’s dynamic solo show has plenty of kapow, thanks to some stylised movement and scene transitions that mirror the action-packed panels of a comic book. Kennedy raises a range of questions about how we make decisions and who we trust. The storyline doesn’t have enough emotional punch, but Kennedy proves she could become a super-powered performer nonetheless. CW“Old-fashioned,” Maureen Lipman calls herself at the start of Up for It, and the term certainly applies to her show, a medley of music and standup, character comedy and counter-revolutionary views on #MeToo. It is, she says, the kind of cabaret that she and co-star, jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth, would enjoy, and will likewise appeal to anyone drawn to big personalities, old jokes and music so smooth you could slide a whisky tumbler down it. BLRead the full three-star reviewDublin-based Malaprop Theatre play mind tricks on us. In three discrete scenes, John Doran, Breffni Holahan and Maeve O’Mahony interrogate ideas about faking history, questioning absolute certainty and curating cultural memory. In each, they pick at a nugget of a conversation – their own or one remembered – smoothing the bumps of memory and creating a thin new film of fiction over fact. A stage manager bustles around the set, manipulating the story, and Malaprop’s deeply layered meta-theatricality dances a step ahead of the audience, teasing and probing. KWRead the full four-star reviewLast year, Rose Matafeo cast herself as the perfect Sassy Best Friend. Now she explains why she’s never been quite right for romantic lead. Horndog is a history of the Kiwi comic’s brushes with love and sex – and, having kissed nine people in her life (she’s 26), that easily fits into a fringe hour. And what an hour it is: another storming set from a woman whose neuroses, intelligence and flamboyant sense of her own ridiculousness make her a near-perfect comedian. BLRead the full four-star reviewThis gloriously silly show about growing up and growing apart, finely stitched into a series of unpredictable, beautifully performed sketches, leaves you light-headed with enjoyment. If you have seen Sheeps’ earlier work, or are familiar with Liam Williams’ dour persona elsewhere, the razzle-dazzle song-and-dance opener is intensely funny. Their sketches pull in all sorts of directions, from surrealist to clever-clever to a brand of political (one sketch is about Syria) that’s seething, sarcastic and ridiculous at the same time. BLRead the full five-star reviewWhen Midsummer debuted at the Edinburgh fringe a decade ago, it was a quiet affair. Two actors on a stage with guitars, slowly falling in love. Today, David Greig’s explosive revival pairs young Bob and Helena (Sarah Higgins and Henry Pettigrew) with older versions of themselves (Benny Young and Eileen Nicholas) to create a joyful story of love, uncertainty and stupid decisions. A glorious tale of making the most of it. KWRead the full five-star reviewTraverse at Jeelie Piece cafe, 8pm, until 26 AugustTucked in a cafe off the edge of the Meadows in Edinburgh, a roomful of strangers stare down at their phones. Perched at a corner table, Terry (Terry O’Donovan) gets a text, and our phones vibrate. Terry’s ex-boyfriend Luka has passed away. His screen is shared with ours, and we see the flood of condolence texts, calls and emails pile up from people he hasn’t spoken to in years. Having been named Luka’s online legacy executor with the new app Fidelis, Terry has to choose whether to keep or delete. Exploring intimacy and loneliness, User Not Found is a beautiful song of love and letting go. With a smart actor and live technology, User Not Found makes use of a newly intimate form of storytelling. KWRead the full four-star review“Theatre is dying. Garry is our only hope,” we’re told. Damien Warren-Smith plays Garry Starr: gangly of limb, quivering with sincerity, and frequently stripped down to nothing but a ruff. He’s here to rescue forsaken theatre by demonstrating every one of its genres in 60 minutes. You can almost hear theatre’s heart come pounding back to life – but defibrillation has seldom been this uproarious. BLRead the full four-star review hereThe playground is a battlefield. Max and his best mate, Stevie, know that more than most. They’re the boys ducking punches and running from bullies, the boys who try to talk tough but feel scared. And for the hour we spend with them in Kieran Hurley and Gary McNair’s new play, they’re the boys hiding out in the school loos, waiting for Max’s imminent fight – his square go – with resident tough guy Danny. CLRead the full four-star reviewAs a demo of comic and performing talent, you can’t fault Emma Sidi’s Faces of Grace. Whether it stacks up to more than the sum of its parts – these portfolio character-comedy shows often don’t – is moot. We meet five characters, from “kinetic-somatic movement practitioner” Cathy via a vacuous young American easily enthused by the banal (“Oh my God, how good is Pizza Express?!”) to a Love Island wannabe snogging Billie Piper at a bus stop. The show crunches realism and absurdism, and its significance remains largely elusive the ostensible theme (all the characters are seeking a state of grace) feels tenuous. But Sidi’s transformations are pretty extraordinary – an ageing Hollywood grande dame comes to life with little more than a Blanche Dubois accent and two downturned corners of the mouth – and the writing and performing are pleasingly spry. BL“I’m the riskiest comic in the biz,” Jordan Brookes boasts in his new show, Bleed. Then he tells us again, and again, until the phrase collapses into gibberish, and his self-esteem collapses, too. Last year’s gripping show Body of Work, nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award, had many hailing Brookes in just those terms. But on the evidence of this follow-up, which is even better, success won’t go to his head. There can’t be much room in there, after all, what with self-loathing, images of violence, playful impulses and limitless ideas for how to subvert a comedy show all jostling for attention. BLRead the full four-star reviewTime to bow our heads and contemplate the passing of inanimate objects. Let us remember the one-eyed space creatures consumed by monsters on German TV, the plastic farm animals strewn to the ground by careless children and the hot-headed balloon man who breathed in too deeply. These and many other death scenes are taken from the “greatest puppet shows in history” by Canada’s Old Trout Puppet Workshop with a style that goes from Looney Toons to Edward Gorey and all points in between. It’s as funny as it is inventive – perfect festival fodder – and all the richer for the darkness and poignancy that grows out of the laughter. MFPart modern murder mystery, part romantic ballet classic, this is a zippy reworking of the big 19th-century Giselle. Splicing enough pointe and arabesque drama into 100 minutes to validate its full-scale provenance, choreographer Ludovic Oniela (formerly of the Royal Ballet) takes a chamber group of 11 from Ireland’s national company on a contemporary urban glide down love’s slippery slope. ABRead the full three-star reviewMemories of Liam Williams’ debut five years ago are stirred by this rookie set from Rob Oldham. The younger comic occupies similar territory, somewhere between depression, wry humour and millennial existential angst. He contrasts his relatively privileged, meaningless life with that of his grandad. One fought a war, the other sits at home talking to his dog and failing to write a novel. In lieu of that magnum opus, we get “tonal prose poems” about being young in 2001, sardonic alternatives to Brexit, and potshots at listicle culture. Sometimes it’s a bit underpowered. One or two routines (a strong one about, er, guns and butt-plugs a more generic bit on the bronze age) seem to belong in a different show. But Worm’s Lament remains a vivid snapshot of being young and half-alive in the 21st century, and whets the appetite to see what Oldham will do next. BLThose who shoot from the hip can easily shoot themselves in the foot, but Fin Taylor seems happy to take that risk. He is one of those provocateur comics whose fearless plain speaking can shade into shock-jockery. But he’s a lively watch and often worth listening to: in recent years on the subjects of race and leftwing tribalism, and now – hold on to your hats! – on post-#MeToo gender politics. He strikes a decent balance between having fun, teasing at bien pensant limits and trying to progress the conversation on gender. Amid the garish sex comedy and loud disdain for fashionable opinion, he is making a striking effort to embrace the complexity of modern sexual behaviour. BLRead the full four-star reviewNew Zealand standup Alice Snedden makes her fringe debut with Self-Titled, and its keynote is confidenc, the show’s subject and its defining characteristic. Nothing about Snedden’s cool and capable delivery says debutante, as she talks us through her home-birth photo album, her sexually overactive parents and her unprecedentedly low Uber rating. There’s a great gag about PMS, too. Through it all, she sends up her self-satisfaction with a lovely light touch, but never backs away from it, as her short set comes up to date with some sacrilegious reflections on #MeToo. There are a couple of weak routines, but one of them is redeemed, as Snedden hits us with a crowd-pleasing party-piece finale. BLDonald Sage Mackay as Roger could be your next-door neighbour, charming, even-tempered and tolerant. After stumbling across the Angry Alan website, he goes through a process of radicalisation and falls for the myth of a gynocentric conspiracy that blames feminism for his reduced status in the world. But there’s something about Roger’s cool-headed reasoning that quickly pushes the play beyond easy satire. His rationale, however misguided, is honestly felt. The play shows how the force of a compelling narrative might throw any of us into a spiral of self-deception. MFRead the full four-star reviewThomas made his name as a leftwing agitator, needling pomposity, fighting injustice, righting wrongs. There’s no edge missing here, but his boyish enthusiasm is a reminder that he is foremost a humanist. He makes a smooth transition, in Nicholas Kent’s carefully paced production, from a celebration of the NHS in its 70th-birthday year to a critique of the complacency, underinvestment and creeping privatisation that is poised to bring it down. MFRead the full four-star reviewShvorne Marks plays Irene, a devout young woman detained after performing a song in a coffee bar. Getting to grips with what offence she has caused makes up the play’s narrative intrigue. In a bleak concrete prison, she is visited by Scarlett Brookes as her best friend Anna and Amanda Wright as secular lawyer Gudrun. In a sequence of short scenes and very short sentences, Skinner shows how a small act of resistance can turn an independent thinker into a political revolutionary. MFRead the full three-star reviewIt is a potent cocktail: a goofy interactive comedy about a macho “douchebag”, with a confrontational sting in its tale. Nate starts superbly, as Palamides – disguised under a lumberjack coat, biker boots, shaggy moustache and marker-pen chest hair – motorbikes on stage to a cock-rock soundtrack. She is chugging cans, toting fake phalluses and flaunting her 2D masculinity. BLRead the full four-star reviewIn the Alice-in-Wonderland logic of the National Rifle Association, “guns don’t kill people, people do”. Martín Zimmerman’s On the Exhale is an attempt to get under the skin of a debate that tells you more about America’s fraught relationship with its history and constitution than it does about reasoned argument. In this story about a bereaved mother, there is a mesmerising performance by Polly Frame. Still, matter-of-fact and measured, her delivery is gripping in its economy and hits home like a bullet. MFRead the full four-star reviewIan Kershaw’s science-fiction fantasy follows an apparently accidental romance that turns out to have been written in the stars. What makes it special, in Raz Shaw’s good-looking production, is the superb performance of Julie Hesmondhalgh as the unnamed narrator, meticulously colouring in the stories of neighbours, friends and love rivals whom she identifies by the footwear she finds in the shoeboxes of Naomi Kuyck Cohen’s set – and also by the shoes she borrows from a willing audience. MFRead the full three-star reviewArguments about Europe, sovereignty, Britain’s place in the world – they’ve all happened before, says Kieran Hodgson. The 2016 referendum was just a cover version. In his new show, ’75, the two-time Edinburgh comedy award nominee traces the roots of our current Brexit malaise back to the 60s and 70s. Few comedy shows since Mike Yarwood’s heyday have leaned so heavily on impersonations of Barbara Castle, Roy Jenkins and Ted Heath. But if Hodgson’s latest is research-heavy – a quality he cheerfully sends up – it’s never fusty. He has created a set that’s enlightening, heartfelt and jam-packed with funny. BLRead the full four-star review“I thought I’d be called,” says Sarah Morris as Donna, as she stumbles apologetically into Mr McCafferty’s classroom. Despite being 29, when she wants to ask a question she instinctively raises her hand. Stephen Jones as her estranged husband, Brian, is scarcely more confident, though he has a bullish swagger to cover his insecurity. In Iseult Golden and David Horan’s fraught and quarrelsome three-hander, this primary school represents a schism. It is not just about the educated and the unread, but the haves and the have-nots. In a society organised to benefit the better off, the school is the site of class warfare. MFRead the full four-star reviewDavid Ireland’s heady black comedy is a satire as timely as it is riotous. If Jacobean revenge tragedies were played as uproarious comedy, they’d look like this. It’s rare to hear an audience repeatedly gasp out loud at the wince-inducing action on stage. Like Jerry Sadowitz, Ireland can make you laugh and doubt the wisdom of your laughter at the same time. MFRead the full five-star reviewIn this dystopian satire, to deviate from the politically correct rules is to initiate social and professional suicide. B (Katherine Pearce) makes a misjudged joke and trips into a world of cultural landmines and magnified consequences. B’s caricaturish colleagues live in a perpetual state of forced, grim wokeness, wearing anonymous suits and tight corporate grins. Under Stef O’Driscoll’s direction, virtue signalling becomes a tangible action: every time an actor says a particular word, their arms wave or knees dip like exaggerated air quotations. The absence of banned words makes the audience fill in the gaps, and allows for the debate to work for any social issue. Let’s start talking to each other, the play begs, before our words start slapping us across the face. KWRead the full three-star reviewThe unnamed setting of Simon Longman’s play is a dead-end place, robbed of jobs and hope, where getting drunk is the only way to pass the time. Sam’s focused on survival, while Pete just wants to get laid. Only Kate plans to escape – if the town will let her. In the encircling space of Paines Plough’s Roundabout theatre, Stef O’Driscoll’s staging creates a clammy sense of imprisonment, making us feel the constraints of geography and circumstance.

If you are so inclined, you can easily watch and listen along, either by going to his website, downloading his iPhone and Android apps, or following him on Twitter.What you can no longer do, as of Monday, is consume Jones’ toxic brew of lies, hate and product placement (his own term for this is “Infowars”) via Facebook, YouTube or Spotify. After Apple decided to stop distributing Jones’ podcasts on Sunday, the other powerful online distribution platforms swiftly followed suit.Jones has desperately attempted to frame his de-platforming as a first amendment violation, but those who invoke the specter of a slippery slope toward authoritarian censorship distract from true significance of this moment: that we are at an inflection point in the way internet platforms conceive of and protect public discourse for society at large.The banishment of Infowars followed an excruciatingly long period of prevarication by Facebook and YouTube – companies that have spent the last two years promising to crack down on bad actors who purposefully sow misinformation and incite violence while simultaneously hosting (and amplifying the reach of) America’s most notorious purveyor of the same.The crisis was not precipitated by anything in particular that Jones said or did – such as his longstanding and baseless allegation that the Sandy Hook school shooting was faked. Instead, it was a pointed question from a CNN reporter at a Facebook event touting its work on misinformation that focused public attention on Jones. Once Facebook was forced to argue its position, it was only a matter of time before the contradiction became too great to bear.Facebook, Jones, his supporters and some civil libertarians attempted to invoke the distinctly American conception of free speech in defending Jones’ right to use private technology platforms, but such arguments fall apart under scrutiny.American social media companies have always censored speech, principally in order to attract advertisers, and secondarily in order to prevent harm against users. This is why these companies banned female nipples long before they banned white supremacists.By moving beyond the knee-jerk framing of Jones’ removal as a free speech issue, we can view his de-platforming as an attempt to clean up the waters he has muddied with misinformation and hatred.For too long, social media companies have policed their platforms as if users are either genuine and acting in good faith or bad actors who violate the rules.These rules don’t apply to Jones, whose playbook is to foster distrust and confusion, shout people down and make meaningful public discourse impossible. He dressed inflammatory, false and cruel statements “sometimes as legitimate speech, mere theater at others, and his readers like and forward it like it’s the latest viral cat video”, Gillespie said.“He produces the commodity that mimics what platforms want, and pretends to be the contribution they swear to protect,” he added.While flip-flopping over Jones, the social media platforms have spent years silencing the voices of activists and journalists – the same people targeted by his hateful agenda.“The ‘free speech’ outrage conveniently protects people like Alex, white rightwing conspiracy theorists that pose an actual, credible harm to many vulnerable communities like immigrants, Muslims, and transgender folks,” said Reem Suleiman, senior campaigner at SumOfUs.One of Jones’s conspiracy theories to have stoked real world-violence is the notion that the left is planning a civil war against “patriots” like him.“It’s really dangerous and contributing to a lot of these running street battles,” said Data \u0026amp Society’s Joan Donovan, citing violence in Portland and Berkeley last weekend ahead of the anniversary of Charlottesville.Facebook has already pledged to clamp down on misinformation that incites violence in places like Sri Lanka and India, but has so far been reluctant to do so on its own doorstep.Jones’s damage extends beyond the victims of his lies, such as the parents of Sandy Hook victims, to the people who believe what he says and “all of us” in society, argued Susan Benesch of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.“He has with various kinds of content caused various different kinds of harm,” Benesch said. “Egregiously false conspiracy theories are bad for the functioning of democracy. How many other people have gotten their ability to understand the world and distinguish fact from fiction degraded by Alex Jones?”Despite Google and Facebook publicly stating they were removing Jones over hate speech, Jones was also becoming a liability in the eyes of advertisers, who did not want to be associated with his toxic brand of entertainment.He might have garnered a large and engaged following, but that’s of no value to the platforms unless it can be monetized. This explains why Jones pivoted to peddling his own supplements, body armour and “prepper” gear for his imaginary civil war.“We’re not talking about morality, we’re talking about capitalism,” said Whitney Phillips, an academic who researches online extremism and manipulation.The one platform that has thus far resisted the urge to do as Tim Cook says (even Pinterest fell in line) has been Twitter. The cacophonous micro-blogging platform has struggled to shrug off the straitjacket of its early years as the “free speech wing of the free speech party”. With chief executive Jack Dorsey reorienting the company’s ethos toward conversational “health”, the decision not to ban Jones and Infowars surprised and angered many.“If we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that’s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction,” Dorsey tweeted. “That’s not us.”Dorsey has continued to engage with his (many) critics on Twitter, and the company has pledged to expedite its process for establishing and revising policies that could result in Jones being banned in the future – including a policy focused on “dehumanizing speech”.Whatever decision Twitter ultimately arrives at, both Benesch and Gillespie said it was healthy to have some ersity among the content rules for internet platforms – and to have public debates with their leaders about the rules.“For years, platforms have been making these moderation decisions on our behalf,” said Gillespie. “Whether they make good decisions or bad ones, the fact that they do it for us may be the core problem, because they’re decisions that belong to the public: where’s the line? what are we willing to tolerate in the name of free speech and what is truly harmful?”“Public outrage is the closest we have right now to collectively considering these hard cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f7ed7cff63c5825fa7ed56ba3fe0a602ea0b6e/0_198_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe8bcdf8007d8fc37177c815659e1e7c","title":"tulsi gabbard how a progressive rising star is a paradox for the left","story":"The Hawaii congresswoman is backed by Bernie Sanders, but her controversial opinions have some progressives miffed Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who made history in 2012 as the first Hindu elected to the US Congress, has cemented herself as a rising star within the Democratic party.She has the support of Bernie Sanders, the de facto leader of the progressive movement, and boasts of endorsements from a string of liberal-friendly groups. The environment-focused Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters, labor unions such as the AFL-CIO, Planned Parenthood and National Nurses United have all given Gabbard, a three-term congresswoman, their blessing as she seeks re-election in the November midterm elections.But Gabbard’s stated progressive bona fides have been called into question by her opponents, who are waging an ambitious challenge from the left in the hopes of pulling off an upset in Saturday’s Hawaii congressional primary.Although their prospects are grim, Gabbard’s critics say her views on foreign policy and tolerance for dictators such as Bashar al-Assad deserve another look.As one of the few Democrats to meet with Donald Trump following his election, Gabbard’s unorthodox positioning has drawn scrutiny at a time when progressives have rallied their midterm messaging around opposition to the president. Her highly controversial visit last year to Syria, where she met with Assad, also raised eyebrows both nationally and at home.“The wake up call, for most of us, came when Gabbard met with Trump soon after his inauguration and then with Assad, instead of marching on DC with us and the rest of the Hawaii’s congressional delegation during the Women’s March in protest of what has become an unprecedented abolition of human and civil rights in America,” said Sherry Alu Campagna, an environmental scientist who is among Gabbard’s most well-known primary challengers.“The incumbent clearly has an agenda that does not involve her constituents and we are waking up to the fact that our needs are taking a back seat to her ambitions.”Gabbard has emerged in recent years as a paradox of the progressive movement. When she was first elected to Congress, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow declared at the time: “She is on the fast track to being very famous.”Indeed, Gabbard swiftly cemented herself as one to watch she co-founded the Congressional Future Caucus, bringing together the youngest members of Congress with an eye on addressing issues facing millennials, and landed assignments on the House committees on foreign affairs and armed services.In the 2016 election cycle, Gabbard seized on an opportunity to further her rise to national prominence. At the height of the hotly contested Democratic presidential primary, Gabbard resigned from her position as the vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee and endorsed the insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders. Gabbard’s move came as Democrats struggled to rein in an intra-party feud stemming from allegations that the DNC was working behind the scenes to influence the nominating contest in Hillary Clinton’s favor.Two years later, Gabbard’s support for Sanders has paid idends. Her re-election bid drew the endorsement of Our Revolution, a grassroots political organization launched by veterans of Sanders’ campaign.“She has been an ardent supporter of many of the issues in our People’s Platform: Medicare for All, transitioning to clean renewable energy, criminal justice reform, and making Wall Street pay their fair share,” the group said in a statement.When asked about Gabbard’s meeting with Assad, the group dubbed Gabbard as “a passionate advocate for peace and diplomacy, which often requires meeting with people whose actions we do not agree with”.But Gabbard’s critics argue her views on foreign policy, immigration and gun laws warrant more scrutiny and undermine the agenda upon which Democrats are campaigning across the country.“Nationally, people thought, she checks all the boxes, this is great,” said Shay Chan Hodges, an activist who unsuccessfully challenged Gabbard in 2016. “But I think people have now started looking more closely at her record and what she’s saying.”Gabbard’s opponents have cited her refusal to debate them as evidence of her reticence to publicly defend her record on certain hot-button issues. Gabbard was unchallenged in 2014 and has not taken part in a primary debate since the year she was elected.Hawaii News Now attempted to convene a debate between Campagna and Gabbard to no avail the congresswoman’s campaign defended the move by stating: “She continues to communicate directly with voters across the district.”It is not uncommon for dominant incumbents to generally avoid debates. But Gabbard’s decision to decline to participate in such a forum has exposed her to charges of hypocrisy, since she forcefully advocated for adding more debates between Clinton and Sanders in 2016 in a high-profile split from other DNC leaders.“While she may think this is a strategic move to prevent the success of her challengers, what it really does is silence the discussion of important issues that face Hawaii’s rural constituents,” said Campagna. “It also prevents any opportunities for voters to hold Tulsi accountable.”In 2015, Gabbard was among a minority of Democrats who voted for additional restrictions on refugees entering the US from Syria and Iraq. She has also previously expressed “skepticism” that the Assad regime is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and aligned herself with nationalist figures such as Narendra Modi of India.Breaking with most Democrats, Gabbard has embraced the use of the phrase “radical Islam” – a phrase which to many Muslims has evolved into a dog whistle on the right intended to indict the entire Islamic faith. Gabbard has said she is mindful that most Muslims are not extremists, but joined Republicans in criticizing Clinton and Barack Obama for not employing the phrase, stating: “It’s important that you identify your enemy”.Gabbard declined an interview for this story.“Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has spoken out strongly against the Trump administration’s travelrefugee ban, the Trump administration’s illegal military strikes against Syria, Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, Trump’s decision to end DACA, and other dangerous decisions and policies,” Erika Tsuji, a spokeswoman for Gabbard’s re-election campaign, said in a statement to the .Gabbard also stands by her meeting with Assad, her spokeswoman said: “She has stated time and again that peace can never be achieved if we only meet and speak with our friends. If we really want peace, we need to be fearless enough to sit down and speak directly with our adversaries.”Although a majority of Democratic voters in Gabbard’s district and neighboring areas said she was obligated to debate her rivals, the snub has not appeared to have had much palpable effect on her prospects.Colin Moore, an associate professor of political science at the University of Hawaii, said Gabbard’s continued popularity was undeniable. But whereas he predicted Gabbard would sail to another term in Congress, Moore said she has yet to truly be tested nationally — where her ambitions may, in fact, be.“The Hawaii congressional delegation has often thought of itself as a team whose primary goal is to go to Washington and bring federal dollars back to Hawaii,” Moore said. “The way they have done that is work with everyone, keep a very low profile, be around for a very long time and rise in seniority.”“Tulsi has really bucked that trend … she is this national political figure, who appears on CNN and other national media outlets quite frequently, talking about issues that don’t directly affect Hawaii.”“That has led to a sense that she’s neglecting her responsibilities and that she isn’t really serving her constituents well,” he added.It was revealed in June that Gabbard is writing a book to be published by a literary agency that boasts of representing presidential contenders. Last October, she traveled on a multi-day swing through the caucus state of Iowa, urging party unity while fueling speculation of higher ambitions.Although her opponents are far from likely to pull off an upset this cycle, the brimming frustration that Gabbard is taking her position for granted – and skepticism around her progressive image – could foreshadow the challenges that lie ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11407629fc01fb46c1331dfe18af07e2da7ac67b/1_0_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492726949cbd26c9e8c7e020d6f1dd22","title":"jacinda ardern having a baby around changes the tone a little bit","story":"In an interview with the , New Zealand PM reflects on life after giving birthJacinda Ardern is having a busy week. By early Friday afternoon she had launched a plastic bag ban, negotiated an end to a strike by nurses and announced plans for a new mental health hospital.From the outside it appears to be business as usual for New Zealand’s prime minister. But seven weeks ago Ardern became only the second leader in the world to give birth while in office, and on Monday she returned to work having to juggle the responsibilities of office with the demands of parenthood.Some things have had to change. Among them is the prime minister’s office tea room, which has been converted into a baby changing room for Ardern’s daughter, Neve Te Aroha. Another is the working day, which now includes breastfeeding every three hours, sometimes mid-briefing. A third thing that has changed is Ardern’s perspective.“Of course it is hard graft in those early weeks,” says Ardern, who appears as relaxed as ever as she speaks to the  about her first weeks of motherhood. “We’re still a very busy workplace obviously and there’s a lot going on, but you get these small moments where I will break to feed Neve and I will continue to be briefed while I am doing that, but it just means that probably the atmosphere feels a bit different. I am sure having a baby around a working environment changes the tone a little bit.”The media is also on a learning curve. On Friday the state broadcaster Television New Zealand apologised after posting footage of Ardern breastfeeding in public online.Neve’s nursery is a combination of a parliament boardroom and a kitchenette, where Ardern has squeezed a changing table, bassinet, a desk for her partner, Clarke Gayford, and “blankets, booties and hats” sent as gifts after the birth.“Basically it is a small kitchenette where usually I would make a cup of tea, but it’s got just enough space for her to be there,” Ardern says.New mothers in New Zealand are eligible for 22 weeks’ paid maternity leave, to be increased to 26 by 2020, but Ardern chose to take just six weeks in a move that ided opinion. In her absence, the deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, held the reins, causing a couple of minor controversies.“In my mind this job is 247, and it definitely didn’t stop over the six weeks. There were moments where I would think: OK, when I go back to work, how am I going to make this particular thing work? It gave me the time to just think that through a little bit and talk it through with Clarke. So I was constantly thinking about that side of things.” Ardern’s time away from work in her Auckland home – where she was left alone by the media, the public and most of her staff – gave her space to reflect on some of her government’s keystone policies. Her commitment to ending child poverty in New Zealand has predictably been strengthened, but so too have other ambitions.Next month Ardern, Gayford and Neve will travel to New York for a United Nations general assembly. Discussing climate change and the rights and wellbeing of women and children worldwide will be among Ardern’s priorities. After Donald Trump’s recent trade threats, stabilising and strengthening international trade agreements will also be on the agenda.“There’s probably a tendency to view power … to be either based on size or the size and power of your economy. I think New Zealand’s strength has always been using our voice on the issues that matter and we’ve been consistent on it. There is power in that,” says Ardern.“Right now, I think that voice has to speak in favour of the power of the collective and the importance of the international community. We can’t act like inidual agents that have no effect on one another. The position we take on trade and the environment and climate change affects one another in this globalised world. So we need to use our power for good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4048f93260df0d8d85573fbe6bc614ed4595edc9/0_10_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c5a9e5667a91e8ed2153eff63575ce","title":"selfish selfie takers spark trevi fountain fisticuffs","story":"Eight-person fight ensues after tourists battle for best spot in front of Roman monumentTwo tourists’ quest for a perfect selfie has caused a brawl at Rome’s Trevi fountain.Fighting broke out after a 19-year-old woman from the Netherlands and a 44-year-old Italian-American woman wanted to take selfies at a prime spot in front of the monument at the same time.The incident happened on Wednesday evening, a time of day when the light makes the fountain a perfect backdrop.What started as an exchange of words between the women became a physical fight and then their respective family members joined in.Neither of the women wanted to give way over the selfie spot, the newspaper La Repubblica reported. Eight people ended up becoming involved in the fight in front of startled onlookers.Two police officers managed to quell the fight, but the truce lasted only a few minutes, and two more officers had to be called in to finally end it.The tourists only sustained bruises but were charged over violence.The Trevi fountain, designed by the architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762, attracts thousands of visitors each year.Patrols at the site were increased after a £1.4m facelift in 2015.Last year, Rome pledged to crack down on bad behaviour involving the city’s fountains, imposing fines of up to €240 (£215) for people caught snacking or camping on the fountains’ pedestals, dipping their feet in the water or going for a swim.Residents are particularly irked by tourists who try to recreate the scene from Federico Fellini’s film La Dolce Vita, in which the late Swedish actor Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2959b6f99fd73b323c4b4d35f309b6444de8e61f/0_74_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218f0ed498cdc4e1671ea6db5852ab63","title":"shanghai residents sleep street heat in pictures","story":"Shanghai’s normally bustling Nanjing East Road has turned into an open-air bedroom on recent nights as local residents try to beat the heat of their cramped homes by sleeping outside on benches or directly on the pavement.

Photograph:  Sebastien CourdjiPool via ReutersThe British government asked Ireland to ease off on its emphasis on peace in Northern Ireland as one of the main issues at stakes in the Brexit talks.The request, from representatives of the UK administration, was made in recent months because British prime minister Theresa May was said to be hurt and concerned her credentials as a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement were not being taken seriously, sources disclosed. However, Dublin did not accede to the call because of a view that the peace process should remain central to the Brexit negotiations.The revelation comes as Mrs May steps up preparations for the UK leaving the bloc without a deal. She is reported to have instructed her officials to make contingencies in such a scenario to ensure the Border is free of customs checks and police.It is understood the request came in meetings between figures from the Irish and UK governments as Mrs May was preparing to secure the backing of her Cabinet for her vision of a future relationship with the European Union after Brexit.The UK government published its white paper on its preferred future relationship last month, which set out a common customs area between the EU and UK, as well as Britain remaining aligned to the European single market for goods.However, its key measures have been met with opposition from the EU. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has also said that the integrity of the EU single market – and the accompanying commitment to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital – must be respected. On the message from the British government on the emphasis on peace and the Irish border, a source said: “Successive Irish and British governments have protected a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland and we need to make sure that continues, regardless of Brexit.” This includes a need for no hard Border.Another Dublin figure said the UK government felt that the peace process and Irish Border were being seen as mostly of concern to “nationalists, Dublin and the EU”, but were equally a concern of unionists and Mrs May’s minority Conservative administration, which has a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). In a letter to members of the Conservative Party in recent days, Mrs May said she “remained clear that no deal is better than a bad deal – and we are stepping up our ‘no deal’ preparations”. Among her commitments, Mrs May said: “There will be no hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We will remain one United Kingdom with a single internal market.” She said the two options on offer from the EU – a “standard” free trade agreement “with Northern Ireland staying in the customs union and parts of the single market” or UK membership of the customs union and single market – are “unacceptable”. The wording of the so-called “backstop” arrangement – which would guarantee no hard border even in a no deal Brexit scenario – is one the main sticking points in EU-UK talks, which Mrs May said have reached an “impasse”. The EU has said that without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement – threatening a “no-deal” Brexit where the UK crashes out of the EU next March.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: North West NewspixOmagh man Kevin Skelton shakes his head when asked what he thinks about former DUP leader Peter Robinson’s advice to unionists that they need to think about preparing for a Border poll which could lead to Irish unity.He later pleaded guilty in an Irish court to unlawful assembly, and paid a large fine, thus avoiding a jail term but earning the nickname, Peter the Punt. “I know what I’d do with a Border poll, where I’d push it,” says Skelton.“I couldn’t give a hoot, couldn’t care less. The south of Ireland doesn’t want us, doesn’t need us and can’t afford us. If the vote was held on both sides of the Border they’d likely reject us. Peter Robinson and Mary Lou McDonald would be better putting their time into getting the assembly back together. There’s none of them wants to deal with the past.”Skelton’s wife Mena was one of the 31 people (including unborn twins) murdered in Omagh when the Real IRA’s massive 1998 carbomb exploded without warning on Main Street. Prepared in the Republic, it had been driven north, passing through Clontibret, and across the border into Tyrone.Relatives and friends are bracing themselves for the 20th anniversary on the 15th of this month. The views of the survivors are as erse as the backgrounds from which their loved ones came and Skelton does not claim to speak for anyone other than himself, though his anger at what he sees as the neglect of the victims is widely shared. He thinks a Border poll is irrelevant, and that Brexit is the critical issue.“My fear is that Brexit could start the Troubles up again. I’d be out of here if there was a hard border,” he said. However, he also believes that the real Border in Northern Ireland is the river Bann. The newly released NI statistics on deprivation support his view that the most prosperous areas are in the northeast, with the western Border areas among the most disadvantaged.“Omagh was already struggling on the shavings from the table, and it never recovered from the bomb,” said Skelton. “It is well on its way to being a ghost town.”Further north and further west, the city of Derry has lately been in the news because of a flare up of street violence among young people under the influence of dissident republicans. The violence included sectarian attacks on the Fountain estate, a tiny unionist enclave alongside the old city walls on the by now almost entirely nationalist west bank of the river Foyle.On Wednesday night a remarkably civil and wideranging debate took place on the other side of the river, the largely unionist Waterside, in a Protestant church hall. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and DUP MP and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson were among the speakers discussing the future of the Northern state.The event was one of 40 in the New Gate Fringe Festival, organised by the North West Cultural Partnership, which includes the Londonderry Bands Forum the membership of which is drawn from young men from some of the most deprived loyalist estates in the region. Public debates including working class nationalists and republicans have long been a feature of Northern political life. An audience predominantly made up, as this one was, of working class unionists is far more rare.“What’s your take, Sir Jeffrey?” said June Elder. Donaldson said the DUP was very clear on the question. “Peter does not speak for the DUP. He is retired. I do,” he said. “I don’t share his view.”Considering such a poll would polarise people and cause further ision, he had not had a single email from a constituent about it. “We are preparing for Brexit.”Elder came back after his response with a supplementary question. “So was Peter just off on a rant?” she asked. “No,” said Donaldson with a tight smile. “He was expressing his opinion.”“Well,” retorted Elder, sceptically, to laughter. “My TV shows the same as yours.”Joe Thompson said he was a unionist but he was angry with the DUP. “For decades they’ve insisted this part of the country is British and now with Brexit they say it can’t be treated any differently from England, Scotland and Wales,” he said. “But people are treated differently when it comes to reproductive rights, marriage rights and the Irish language act.”Donaldson said devolution meant that different parts of the UK would have different laws. He said the place to legislate for the issues Thompson raised was at Stormont and reiterated his party leader Arlene Foster’s accusation that Sinn Féin was “holding to ransom” the parties which wished to resume powersharing. “We no longer have a veto,” he said, pointing out that to use a “petition of concern” to block new legislation 30 votes were needed. “We only have 28,” he said.McDonald retorted that Foster had just that morning backed the use of a blocking mechanism to prevent a local council from flying the rainbow flag this weekend, Saturday August 4th, as part of LGBTQ Pride events around the North.Afterwards, Thompson, who works in Derry and lives in Mid Ulster, told The  he was not satisfied with Donaldson’s response. “The DUP is coming across as just so arrogant,” he said. “They’d get their 30 votes to block progressive change – they know it and so do we. I support the union but I vote Alliance now. Peter Robinson was right to say what he did about a Border poll. It is going to happen and the chaos that followed the Brexit vote showed that we need preparations.”The audience at the debate strikingly included many young people. On his way out after an intense 2½ hours, Chris Smith said a Border poll would be pointless. “It is not a question people need answered,” he said. “I am a unionist and I want the politicians either to get Stormont up and running or go back to Direct Rule. As it is we are losing out every way. My girlfriend works in the NHS here and she has just had to forego a payrise that colleagues elsewhere are getting. My mate is a firefighter but because of cuts his job is about to be lost.”Julia Kee, a community worker on a programme made possible by the EU’s Peace 4 funding, shared this view. “We have more important things to be thinking about than a Border poll,” she said. “I am a unionist and we have been hearing nothing but this anti-choice, anti-LGBT rights talk from the DUP.“The political impasse is creating political unrest around Northern Ireland including here in this city,” she said. “Then you get politicians calling young people scumbags and that does not help.”Hospital consultant Fergal McNicholl is from Greysteel, the Co Derry village which became internationally known after loyalists burst into a pub there in 1993 and sprayed it with gunfire, killing eight people. He came to the debate at the invitation of his friend, Dave Duggan, a writer from the city.“I felt quite privileged to be here tonight,” said McNicholl. “It was very impressive that they got a mixed audience and the fact that there was no tension was a massive step forward.” He was not inclined to favour preparing for a Border poll. “The territorial issue puts our identity back into conflict – I quite like it the way it was,” he said. “There was a period where I felt I could be comfortably Irish in this town and live beside someone who was comfortably British. Brexit has already raised territorial issues. It makes things harder. It unsettles us.”Georgina Campbell is a young dancer. She told the panel that she was worried and wanted to know if, in a new Ireland, the likes of her would have a place. She said that the Highland dancing that is her medium is rooted in British military history and that the highest honour available is to dance for the queen. Afterwards, she explained that a Border poll meant nothing to her.“We should just have a government,” she said. “My three best friends are nationalist girls who are self-employed artists. Highland dancers and Irish dancers work together on a regular basis, but a lot of our cultural activities are in our own communities. Northern Ireland is unique and special. We need to embrace it and we need to market it. It is just this big mad eclectic place. I love it so much – I’ll never move away.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578359.1532700124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the history of the kettle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat, which is just another form of energy the heat then boils the water. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien During the recent heat wave I realised just how assimilated to Ireland I have become. No, it wasn’t because I complained that the temperature was too high just three days in. It was because I kept making cups of tea, hot cups of tea. Somehow in 17 years a beverage I just about tolerated in cold weather became suitable refreshment for any weather. This got me thinking about the technology that I use to make my tea. I imagine that almost every household in Ireland owns an electric kettle. They are, to my continued surprise, not very popular in the United States. One of the earliest uses of electricity to power a small household appliance, the kettle hasn’t changed very much in over 50 years.An electric kettle changes electrical energy into heat (just another form of energy), the heat then boils the water. Heat is generated by passing an electrical current through a material that provides resistance. The bottom of the kettle is generally where heat is created, replacing the fire over which it might have been boiled. The use of electricity to produce “clean” heat in the home expanded in the 1880s with a particular focus on cooking technologies such as electric stoves. However, it was not until the 20th century that the availability of household wiring and the lower price of electricity made home electrical appliances more attractive. Small appliances were connected at a lamp socket, in place of the lamps that represented the first use of electricity in homes.Early electric kettles look exactly like standard kettles except with a flex attached. They were not as efficient as current kettles, taking perhaps 20 minutes to boil. One model, the Prometheus kettle from the turn of the century, can still be found as an antique. In 1929, the ESB advertised a copper “electric automatic safety kettle” that looked much like the Prometheus of 30 years before. They enticed customers with the promise that the kettle “will not get black” and was “absolutely clean because electricity heats without flame”.The automatic safety element the ESB advertised was one of the first modifications of the design. Prior to its introduction, it was possible to boil the kettle dry causing the kettle to fail and risking an electrical fire. Yet the safety device created its own problems. A person whose kettle had stopped working was tempted to investigate the cause of the failure themselves. Death by electrocution often followed. A series of articles in the British Medical Journal as late as the 1960s suggested that women over 60 were particularly vulnerable to electrocution “due to the use of scissors in the investigation of the connectors of electric irons and kettles”. One doctor even described the electric kettle with its safety device as “a booby trap for old ladies”.Unbeknown to the old ladies and indeed their old doctors, a modified safety switch was already available. The new switch, one that we tea drinkers are familiar with from its happy click, was operated by steam and turned off the kettle once it had boiled. The kettle did not boil dry nor did it short circuit and those thirsty for tea were not tempted to poke at wiring with the nearest available pointed object. By the 1960s the electric tea kettle was a standard, and safe, home appliance.If you are intrigued by the history of household technologies then I recommend a visit to Johnstown Castle in Co Wexford. The gardens are beautiful for a walk and you can even feed the peacocks. But if you fancy a break from the heat, or you’re lucky enough to get a rainy day, the museum is well worth a visit. Billed as an agricultural museum, this is in many ways really a museum of the history of technology. There is plenty of technology relating to farming from early tractors to milking machines to pesticide spreaders. On the very top floor, almost at the end of the exhibition is an exploration of household technologies. You can compare model kitchens pre and post electrification and read about a variety of different home electrical devices and their introduction. And then you can go downstairs to refresh yourself with a cup of tea and an excellent scone.

We wrote to the provincial health secretary asking him to restrict these two drugs from the area. I think it\u0027s good news for vultures.”The Chief Drug Inspector of Sindh has ordered regional and district drug inspectors to restrict the use of aceclofenac and ketoprofen..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmissionPakistan Vulture Restoration ProjectThe Pakistan Vulture Restoration Project (PVRP) led by Mr Iqba l has spent the past 12 years campaigning for the banning of the toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which cause kidney failure in the birds.A statement from the PVRP, which includes the UK\u0027s Hawk Conservancy Trust and the WWF, said vultures\u0027 collapse had “serious consequences for people”.Their waste removal service controls the populations of disease-carrying scavengers that are a threat to human health.“By suppressing the numbers of mammalian scavengers at carcasses, the potential for disease transmission is reduced. Without vultures, the numbers of mammalian scavengers increases, which increases the potential for disease transmission, threatening the health of humans and wildlife.”Vultures\u0027 removal of carrion leaves less food for other scavengers, such as dogs. A collapse in vulture numbers in India has been blamed for a huge rise in the feral dog population at the same time and a rise in rabies cases. Vultures strong digestive juices also allow them to eat diseased carrion, cleaning up carcasses that may be infected with deadly microbes.Where will the next pandemic come from? | The candidatesThe most common NSAID, diclofenac, was banned from veterinary use in Pakistan, India and Nepal in 2006. But vets have continued to use residual stockpiles and the similar drugs aceclofenac and ketoprofen have continued to pose a threat to the Gyps group of vultures, including white-backed vultures and long-billed vultures. Tens of millions are thought to have died in the past two decades across South Asia alone, cutting populations by somewhere between 95 and 99 per cent.Mr Iqbal said conservationists will conduct spot checks at vets to see if the restrictions have really cut back on the availability of the drugs, or whether they are still available on the black market.He has been carrying out research on vultures for more than 20 years. He said: “The populations are still declining. If this decline continues, we are afraid that these species will become extinct.”To try to stem the birds\u0027 decline, the PVRP has set up a breeding centre in Punjab province and a “vulture safe zone” in Sindh where some of the last colonies of white-backed and long-billed vultures can be found.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Thousands of Muslims protest demolition of Chinese mosque in rare moment of defiance Muslim women on the burka Comment: Don\u0026#39t fear the surge in summer wasps – they are the unsung heroes of the countryside Take in the news three times as fast under BBC experiment to change how we read wordsHeatwave causes rare Chinese tree to blossom after more than a centuryHelmet saves scooter driver\u0026#39s life after being run over by lorry in ChinaTour de France champion Jan Ullrich arrested on suspicion of assaulting a prostitute in Frankfurt Frites could be off the menu in Belgium as heatwave threatens potato supply Donald Trump attacks kneeling NFL players - telling them to \u0026#39find another way to protest\u0026#39Ryanair passengers complain of being stranded across Europe during 24-hour strikesBen Stokes drank beer, vodka and \u0026#39potentially Jägerbombs\u0026#39 on night of street fight but denies being drunkMuslim convert admits plotting to kill 100 in Isil terror attack outside Oxford Street Disney StoreIdris Elba\u0026#39s hopes of being first black James Bond raised as producer says \u0026#39it is time\u0026#39Taliban try to storm key Afghan city of GhazniChildren groomed online in less that 45 minutes, warns NSPCCAll roads led to Rome but they also led to Europe\u0026#39s modern-day prosperity, study findsFrench see red over \u0026#39blue\u0026#39 wine from Spain, as experts challenge claims about how it is producedCanada shooting: several dead and suspect in custody in FrederictonDriving instructor convicted of sex attacks on 14 young female studentsEveryone over 50 to be offered bowel cancer screening in new plans Supermarket collapses as aftershock rocks Indonesia\u0026#39s LombokWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"bbc launches experiment change read words","story":"The technique could allow people to read news on the small screens of smartphones more easilySince the Greeks switched from etching words in stone with a chisel to writing with ink on parchment or papyrus, the western world has read from left to right.But the BBC has launched a new project which could completely change the way we process words.The corporation is testing a new kind of speed-reading technology in which news bulletins on smartphones or watches would be flashed up one word at a time, rather than being shown in full sentences.As part of the new technique, the reader\u0027s eye is drawn to the \u0027optimal recognition point\u0027 in the word, which is highlighted red.  That helps the brain identify the word more quickly than with traditional horizontal scanning so that words can be scrolled through more quickly. The optimum recognition point in the word is highlighted red to avoid having to scan horizontally to find the meaning While the average person reads at a rate of around 200 words per minute, the BBC are testing speeds of 300 to 800 words per minute.Speaking about the new project, Cyrus Saihan, the BBC’s Head of Digital Partnerships, said: “UK adults now spend more time online and consuming media each day than they do sleeping. We wanted to see what new technologies could be applied to make this overload of information easier for our audiences to manage.“The technology that we have used in our experiment works on the theory that, by showing you only one word at a time, your eyes can stay in a fixed position and so don’t have to be constantly moving whilst you read.“As a result, the rate at which you can read can be dramatically increased.”The technology could help people read smartphones more easily The corporation are working alongside the technology company Spritz, which invented the technique.Mr Saihan said it took a few minutes to adjust to the new process and after that it becomes ‘relatively easy’ to read full sentences. He claims it will with the problem of reading on smaller and smaller screens and make it easier to catch up on the headlines on a packed bus or train.The BBC said at the moment the project is just an experiment to see what is possible, but said such technology may become crucial in a world of augmented and mixed reality devices.The BBC has teamed up with SpritzMr Saihan added: “We might need to completely adapt the way that we read – reading large blocks of text in mid-air might not be possible.“Perhaps speed reading text floating in the air, one word at a time, might become something that the children of the future consider to be the norm.”However experts have warned that the brain may not be able to keep up with such fast scrolling which could lead to eye problems, tiredness and failure to understand the sentence.Dr Cyriel Diels, a cognitive psychologist and human factors researcher at Coventry University said “A big difference with normal self-paced reading is that this system-paced reading requires continuous focus and attention on the display to be able to understand any text.“This will require more effort and may easier lead to fatigue and eye strain. As it is system paced you can easily miss out words and hence no longer understand the content.“People’s ability to follow the text will be different for different people, some may be able to follow it at high speeds whereas others won’t.“Having said that, I think it’s a great idea and impressive how well it works. It may be very suitable under certain circumstances. I don’t think it can totally replace traditional reading.”Epilepsy Action also said that they would want the technology to pass tests to make sure it was safe for people with epilepsy before it was rolled out“While this is potentially very exciting technology, it would need to be rigorously tested to ensure that this is safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy,” said a spokesman.“Any video containing flashing or flickering lights, or patterns should be tested to ensure that they will not trigger seizures.”Comment: Don\u0026#39t fear the surge in summer wasps – they are the unsung heroes of the countryside Heatwave causes rare Chinese tree to blossom after more than a centuryHelmet saves scooter driver\u0026#39s life after being run over by lorry in ChinaTour de France champion Jan Ullrich arrested on suspicion of assaulting a prostitute in Frankfurt Frites could be off the menu in Belgium as heatwave threatens potato supply Donald Trump attacks kneeling NFL players - telling them to \u0026#39find another way to protest\u0026#39Ryanair passengers complain of being stranded across Europe during 24-hour strikesBen Stokes drank beer, vodka and \u0026#39potentially Jägerbombs\u0026#39 on night of street fight but denies being drunkMuslim convert admits plotting to kill 100 in Isil terror attack outside Oxford Street Disney StoreIdris Elba\u0026#39s hopes of being first black James Bond raised as producer says \u0026#39it is time\u0026#39Taliban try to storm key Afghan city of GhazniChildren groomed online in less that 45 minutes, warns NSPCCAll roads led to Rome but they also led to Europe\u0026#39s modern-day prosperity, study findsFrench see red over \u0026#39blue\u0026#39 wine from Spain, as experts challenge claims about how it is producedCanada shooting: several dead and suspect in custody in FrederictonDriving instructor convicted of sex attacks on 14 young female studentsEveryone over 50 to be offered bowel cancer screening in new plans Supermarket collapses as aftershock rocks Indonesia\u0026#39s LombokAt least 29 children \u0026#39returning from picnic\u0026#39 among the dead after Saudi-led coalition air strike hits busBoris Johnson could be given ersity training instead of being sanctioned over burka commentsTrump slaps new tariffs on Turkey, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39 as lira tumbles amid US rowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000171419396_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"heatwave causes rare chinese tree blossom century","story":"Quiet for 100 years, the rare tree has finally blossomed this summerA rare Chinese tree that has sat flowerless in a Cardiff park for more than a century has now blossomed for the first time “because of the heatwave”.The creamy white flowering of Roath Park’s Emmenopterys henryi, which stunned the local wardens, is believed to be only the sixth such occasion since the species was introduced to the UK at the beginning of the twentieth century.However, it has been joined by other blossoming Emmenopterys in Gloucestershire and Sussex, leading experts to conclude the sustained record temperatures are the cause.The species was first planted in the Europe in 1907, having been sent from Hubei province by the renown plant collector Ernest henry Wilson.Despite a “few hundred” under cultivation at various show gardens across the UK, most have never blossomed, according to Tony Kirkham, head of the Arboretum at Kew.Kew\u0026#39s tony Kirkham, in among more traditional trees, says it may take 20 years before Britons see another Emmenopterys blossomThe first recorded British flowering was in 1987 at Wakehurst Place in West Sussex, and before this summer the most recent flowering was in 1912 in Cambridge.“There are probably more flowering this year than in the last hundred years put together,” said Mr Kirkham, who wrote a book on Ernest Henry Wilson.“It’s incredible because they are beautiful plants and it might be another 20 years until we see another flower.“It must be to do with this heat.”Other than in Roath Park, Emmenopterys are flowering at Batsford Arboretum in Gloucestershire and at Borde Hill Garden in West Sussex, as well as at Wakehurst Place.Gareth Stamp, community ranger at Roath Park, said: This really is something special to see.

He doesn\u0027t look 45. No one would even know. When Sean Connery stepped into the scene he was a rough old dude.”While many have pointed out that Elba will be nearing his 50s as the casting takes place, fans of the actor have said age is just a number, and that he is in great shape.James Bond: who is the best 007?At 45, he is five years younger than Daniel Craig, and the same age as Roger Moore when he starred in Live and Let Die.The Luther star has made the point himself, and shrugged off rumours in 2016, commenting: “I think I’m too old for that man, running around in cars and ladies and martinis, who wants to do that?”He did, however, say it was up to the studio whether he would be a fit for the role, and in 2015 commented he would “absolutely” become Bond if asked.In January this year, he remained coy when asked his thoughts about potentially becoming 007, asking why the job couldn’t go to a woman.He said to Vanity Fair: “It could be a woman - could be a black woman, could be a white woman. Do something different with it. Why not?”Elba has been a favourite to replace Craig since 2014, after leaked documents from the Sony hack revealed that Amy Pascal, co-chair of the company, put him forward.An email from the executive simply read: “Idris should be the next Bond.”Other favourites to play the role include Tom Hardy, Poldark’s Aidan Turner and Tom Hiddleston.James Bond | Actors who have played BondSome fans have said it is time for a woman to take over the role, and Gillian Anderson helped stoke rumours on social media in 2016 by tweeting a mocked-up Bond poster with her as the star.John Boyega has also been tipped by some as a potential first black Bond, and has hinted he may want to play the part at some point, adding he was “too young” for it at the moment.Fans may have a long wait to find out whether the rumours are true Bond 25 is not set to hit the silver screen until October of next year. Filming begins in December.It is unlikely the new Bond will be announced until Daniel Craig holsters his gun and bids farewell to the role for good.Many were surprised that the actor signed up for the next Bond film. In 2015 he told the : “\u0027Now? I’d rather … slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.”Representatives for Barbara Broccoli have been contacted for comment.Please review our commenting policyComment: Don\u0026#39t fear the surge in summer wasps – they are the unsung heroes of the countryside BBC launches experiment to change how we read wordsHeatwave causes rare Chinese tree to blossom after more than a centuryHelmet saves scooter driver\u0026#39s life after being run over by lorry in ChinaTour de France champion Jan Ullrich arrested on suspicion of assaulting a prostitute in Frankfurt Frites could be off the menu in Belgium as heatwave threatens potato supply Donald Trump attacks kneeling NFL players - telling them to \u0026#39find another way to protest\u0026#39Ryanair passengers complain of being stranded across Europe during 24-hour strikesBen Stokes drank beer, vodka and \u0026#39potentially Jägerbombs\u0026#39 on night of street fight but denies being drunkMuslim convert admits plotting to kill 100 in Isil terror attack outside Oxford Street Disney StoreTaliban try to storm key Afghan city of GhazniChildren groomed online in less that 45 minutes, warns NSPCCAll roads led to Rome but they also led to Europe\u0026#39s modern-day prosperity, study findsFrench see red over \u0026#39blue\u0026#39 wine from Spain, as experts challenge claims about how it is producedCanada shooting: several dead and suspect in custody in FrederictonDriving instructor convicted of sex attacks on 14 young female studentsEveryone over 50 to be offered bowel cancer screening in new plans Supermarket collapses as aftershock rocks Indonesia\u0026#39s LombokAt least 29 children \u0026#39returning from picnic\u0026#39 among the dead after Saudi-led coalition air strike hits busBoris Johnson could be given ersity training instead of being sanctioned over burka commentsTrump slaps new tariffs on Turkey, as Erdogan tells people to \u0026#39trust in God\u0026#39 as lira tumbles amid US rowWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/01/11/writer-desk.jpg","title":"author how to write advice twitter rule stephen king hemingway","story":"Created with Sketch.We all know there’s more than one way to skin a cat, so why should advice on how to write be so prescriptive? Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own. It’s the same with writing. See how others do it, then work out how you’re going to do it yourself. And never let anyone tell you that you’re doing it wrong, or that you should be doing it their way.So, what are you waiting for? Go write a book. But first, maybe go read one.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/13/01/jim-ratcliffe.jpg","title":"brexit new poll public final say no deal scenario","story":"Created with Sketch.Just one in four trust parliament with the decision as ‘no deal’ looms according to 10,000 strong poll sampleClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Half of Britons want final say in no-deal scenario, major new poll findsHalf of Britons want a referendum on leaving the European Union if Brexit talks collapse and the country faces leaving with no deal, a major new poll has revealed.The huge study carried out by YouGov, which surveyed a weighted sample of more than 10,000 people, found just a quarter want parliament to be given the final decision.The key finding comes as concern over a no-deal Brexit increases, precipitating a slump in sterling\u0026nbspamid news that the UK government is stockpiling food and medicine.The findings are\u0026nbspalso a major boost to the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum, which commissioned the poll, and The Independent’s own Final Say campaign – which has attracted more than half a million signatories to its petition.The survey also shines a light on views of Brexit’s progress, with large majorities thinking talks are going poorly, that the process of leaving has been a mess, that the country would end up with a bad deal and that the British government would bear responsibility.Former president of YouGov Peter Kellner said: “If the Brexit negotiations with Brussels break down, a two to one majority of voters want the public, not parliament, to decide what happens.“Even people who voted Leave tend to prefer a new referendum, by 39-34 per cent. This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly. Support for a new referendum would go well beyond the ranks of those who want to stop Brexit.”The pollsters asked “should the final decision be made by MPs voting in parliament or the public voting in a new referendum”, if the UK had to choose whether to remain in the EU or leave with no deal.It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this messHalf, 50 per cent, said the decision should be given to the public voting in a new referendum. Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The convention comes only at the end of two decades, 51 working groups, more than a dozen meetings between foreign ministers, and four presidential summits.\u0026nbspBut then again, a lot is at stake – namely billions of dollars of oil and gas contracts. The Caspian, the largest enclosed body of water in the world, contains a massive 48 billion barrels of oil and 9 trillion cubic metres of natural gas in proven offshore reserves.\u0026nbspAnd that is what we know about: there may be much more, but territorial disputes have frustrated attempts at proper exploration.\u0026nbspThe Caspian problem arose after the breakup of the USSR. Before then, the water was split between two nation states: Iran and the Soviet Union. Afterwards, there were four new\u0026nbspnations to deal with: Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.\u0026nbspOne of the major stumbling blocks has been the status of the sea itself. Is it really a sea\u0026nbspor a lake?This is no simple debate over words, but of development rights and cash. If it is designated a lake, the rights are ided up equally, with each nation receiving 20 per cent. If, however, it is deemed to be\u0026nbspa sea, it is split between the competing nations\u0026nbspin proportion\u0026nbspto each one’s share of its coastline.\u0026nbspIran, the major loser in the sea approach, had been resisting the definition.\u0026nbspAn early draft of the document published for a short time on the website of Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev suggested that the countries would agree to classify it as a sea. According to that document, the sea bed will be ided into sectors, and the waters between nations, fishing and\u0026nbspcommon spaces. But a surprise may be in store.\u0026nbspTrump’s silence on the Russia sanctions shows he is scared of PutinKremlin: US sanctions ‘categorically unacceptable’ and ‘illegal’Russia threatens ‘horrible’ conflict if Georgia joins NatoSpeaking with the Kommersant newspaper on Friday, deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin said there would be “new” jurisdiction\u0026nbspfor the Caspian.\u0026nbsp“The Caspian Sea will have its own legal status,” he said. “The five littoral states will have the full jurisdiction over resources in their sectors of the seabed.”In the absence of an agreement, the countries have continued to develop the seabed they believed belonged to them. To some extents, the treaty will formalise what is already happening.\u0026nbspBut, crucially, it will also reaffirm Russia’s geopolitical dominance in the region. It is understood the convention will contain clauses asserting that only the Caspian five will have the rights to use the sea region\u0026nbspfor military purposes. Airspace would be ided between\u0026nbspthe signatory states, and\u0026nbspRussia’s Caspian Flotilla will be guaranteed access to the entire sea.Moscow was reported to have been concerned about the possibility of Nato\u0026nbspbuilding future ties in the region.

I think Brexit is the least of their difficulties. The Commission is  of the treaties, it has almost become a quasi-religion for them, \u0026lsquohow dare any country even want to leave?\u0026rsquoThe EU has got some significant problems.

meningitis","story":"Brogan Partridge was holidaying in Cornwell for her parents honeymoon when she was struck by the deadly infection.The now nine-year-old started vomiting after a day at the beach but her parents, Aimee and Craig Partridge, thought she had an infection and encouraged her to rest.But soon after Aimee started to notice bruises appearing on Brogans legs.Brogan lost her foot to the disease, which took hold in June 2016, and has recently had her right leg amputated below the knee after years of pain caused by the infection.Aimee said the bruises looked nothing like the tell-tale rash all parents are told to look out for.The first sign something was wrong came when Brogan appeared to have an eye infection and was given antibiotics.But 12 days later the bruises began to appear on the then seven-year-olds legs.After seeing a GP, Brogan was rushed to Birmingham Childrens Hospital where doctors were forced to amputate her left foot to save her life.Mum Aimee, 27, from Bartley Green, Birmingham, said: “Wed been in and out of the sea all week so, at first we thought the first signs of the meningitis were conjunctivitis caused by swimming in the ocean.“It looked nothing like a rash, it looked more like bruising – at the time I never thought it was meningitis and that’s the problem.“When people are aware of what symptoms to look out for with meningitis, they say look for a rash but that’s not what it looked like to me.Brogan was fitted with a prosthetic foot and her parents, Craig and Aimee, thought the worst was behind them.But now they’ve had to make the heart-breaking decision to amputate Brogan’s right leg below the knee, because she lives in constant pain.The disease caused the blood vessel in Brogans right leg to die, which led to circulation problems.Aimee said: Doctors thought her right foot would heal, so she had hours worth of surgery to keep it.“The infection has spread up to her knee and the leg is just too weak and could put her at risk later in life if we keep it.“The main blood vessel in her leg died and it is not getting blood to her foot – also the tendon for the toes died too.“The weaker the foot gets the more susceptible it is to damage.”Aimme said that Brogan has faced every challenge without faltering and knew her only option is to lose her leg.“It’s horrible because truly Brogan just wants to be a normal nine-year-old girl,” she added.“She knows the process and it’s not nice but children tend to adapt quicker to situations and I think that’s what Brogan is going to do.“Having one foot to having none is going to be very different for Brogan – she’s going to lose the last bit of independence she has.“There are always risks in everything but this is the sole solution that we and the doctors came too.“They can never guarantee it won’t come back.“We always hoped it wouldn’t have to come to this but after seeing the impact it was having on her we thought it’s the best option we have.“We don’t know if we keep that leg that in the next five years the disease might have gotten worse and spread further.”The family were planning a trip to Disneyland later in the year, but now they don’t know if Brogan will be well enough to travel.“We want to take all the children to Disneyland later this year but we can’t really plan ahead just in case Brogan had to go back to hospital, or she started to feel worse,” Aimee added.“We don’t even know if she would be well enough at the time to even fly – we are pretty much taking it day by day.“We can’t really make any long-term plans – it feels like our lives are on hold.”Dad Craig, 31, a mechanic, added: “At first it was a big shock for all of us but at the moment we are at the point where we just want to get it over and done with really.“The younger children are only three and four and this is all they can remember – they’ve grown up with Brogan having meningitis.“But they don’t bat and eye lid they just see Brogan as their big sister.The family are also fundraising for a wheelchair for Brogan, which will cost £2,000.You can donate tot heir cause at their Go Fund Me page here.The deadly disease can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young kids and young adults.Meningitis causes an inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord and can be triggered by bacteria or a virus.If it is not treated quickly meningitis can develop in deadly septicaemia, or blood poisoning, that can cause permanent damage to the brain or nerves.Around 3,200 people a year are diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and one in 10 die or are left with life-changing disabilities.Viral forms of meningitis are less common and rarely life-threatening.What are the key symptoms?The symptoms of meningitis can develop very quickly, and include:In babies the symptoms can be slightly different, they may: Source: Meningitis Research

is a knee-jerk term of abuse favoured by the Left, usually accompanied by “fascist” — or “Nazi” if Ken Livingstone’s anywhere nearby.So it is richly amusing to see Jeremy Corbyn publicly embraced by the Ku Klux Klan as a fellow Jew-hater.It takes one to know one.Jezza has at least done us all a favour by coming out as a genuine lifelong racist and proving he is unfit to hold any proper job, let alone as Prime Minister of this country.Helpfully, he has also exposed Labour’s own enduring hypocrisy in selectively deciding who and what is “racist”. Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those being treated for an attempted overdose rose more than ten-fold — from 249 in 1997 to 2,736.As far as I am concerned, social media is almost entirely responsible.In a world where everyone relies on their phones for everything, there has never been a more worrying time for mental health.To be a teenage girl in this day and age is to be never alone — and always lonely.They are spending day after day wading through airbrushed photos of images society has deemed perfect.Whether it is a member of the Kardashian family posing with a diet pill, a boob job advert in the middle of Love Island or a photo of a friend with whitened teeth and smooth skin, our screens are filled with how we can be better — with how we SHOULD be better.Jon Goldin is vice chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.He  said recently: “There are a range of factors putting pressure on young children — academic pressure, exam pressure, social media . . . with fear of missing out and comparing yourself unfavourably to images you see online.“If you look at social media, my hunch is that girls are probably more sensitive to some of those factors than boys.”Although suicide is still the biggest killer of men under 45, awareness of this is at an all-time high. Hospital admissions for self-harm in boys, while still too high (2,236 last year), are stable.There was a campaign (which I took part in) two weeks ago that went viral on Instagram as people were asked to signal that they were OK as a means of opening a conversation on mental health.It is a conversation that desperately needs to be had.Despite massive steps to raise awareness, not least the Royal Family getting behind the Heads Together campaign for last year’s London Marathon, the internet — and young girls’ place in it — still needs a lot of talking about.I was lucky. Instagram was only invented when I was 16 and it did not matter a jot that I did not start using it until I was 18. Although we had social media, it was in its infancy, and I am incredibly grateful for that. My phone played a very small part in my life as a teenager.24% of girls are depressed by age 1480,000 UK kids suffer from severe depression90% of teen girls unhappy with their bodies70% of young people have been cyber-bulliedAs I went through the trials of being a young, insecure girl at school, negative thoughts were not able to follow me home. I would say goodbye to the bitching at 3.30pm and eat bangers and mash with my siblings without a thought for the girls in my class — no pinging from my phone to create waves of anxiety.These days that is simply not an option.Every issue that every teenager has ever faced is magnified to an extraordinary level with the advancement of technology.But removing phones from our daughters is simply not an option. Telling a teenager they can not have the internet is to tell them they can not have friends.Ten years ago a teenage friendship could withstand a summer holiday of no contact, but now a weekend with no signal, a Tuesday night with no Instagram story, makes kids hyperventilate.To be offline is to be forgotten. It is not showing up to the only party. The party that is going on all day and, more worryingly, all night too.Self-harm is, more often than not, a cry for help.As the internet forces its way into every corner of our lives, I cannot help but feel that it is a cry for human attention for affectionate, real-life attention.Warning signs  include if a child starts talking about themself in terms of failure or if there is a  change in their eating or sleeping patterns.Try asking  open-ended questions and do not give up if they are reluctant to  respond.Do not ban social media but set a good example and do activities away from it together.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritans (free) on 116 123.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM has — finally — started to talk to them with a concrete plan.The silence after her meeting with Emmanuel Macron is concerning, but the noises from German business leaders and politicians from the Continent in recent weeks are more promising.As the clock ticks, it’s time for them to tell Brussels that the theatrics and the anti-Britain briefings have to end. The Chequers fudge is not perfect. But Brussels would be mad to knock it back.And if they do? Planning is already stepping up for a clean-break Brexit.The PM still believes no deal is better than a bad deal and insists she’s ready to walk away.And that, as President Trump knows, is The Art Of The Deal…AND so another new front opens up in the war against the motorist.It’s outrageous that companies in some parts of the country could be charged if their employees drive to work.Those firms, who have already paid business rates for having a car park, will just pass on the extra cost to workers. Another stealth tax, another pocket emptied.We wouldn’t mind so much if we believed the money would be ploughed back into the roads, getting rid of potholes and fixing rocky road surfaces. Or if the trains turned up when they’re supposed to.But we won’t hold our breath.POLICE unions never fail to complain about overwork and stress on the job.We can understand why. It’s not an easy job. Coppers have our respect.But the news that one in 12 have second jobs suggests that not all of the wailing about long hours and working conditions are entirely legitimate.The next time a victim is told there’s nobody available to investigate, they might wonder what their local bobbies are up to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasn’t surprised I choked on my toast because anything bad that happens to me — big or small — I’ve already lived through in my imagination.But I choked at the sheer obviousness of the scientists’ conclusions. Of course feeling stressed helps people deal with bad news. What next? Scientists discover sleep is related to tiredness?I can deal with bad news better because I’ve already been in that moment. I’m well prepared because I’ve actually lived it in my head.Anyway, the choking passed and, to my surprise, I didn’t die. That’s another beauty of always believing the worst will happen. What a wonderful surprise it is when the worst doesn’t happen.The toast didn’t kill me. I cheated the choke. Oh, the joy.I don’t know how long I’ve been this way. It’s definitely been going on since I was a kid.I remember flying off on holiday to what was then Yugoslavia with my mum and dad. I recall my mum trying to talk to me about all the exciting things we’d be doing when we got to my nan’s house on the Adriatic.I kept shaking my head and not saying anything and she got annoyed and rolled her eyes, thinking I just wasn’t looking forward to our holiday.But she misunderstood me. I didn’t want to think about the nice things we’d be doing because I was so convinced the plane was going to crash that it made me sad to consider what I surely wouldn’t experience.Imagine, then, my joy when the plane didn’t actually crash and I ended up not dying. What a bonus!And I went in the sea and didn’t drown — another nice surprise.I almost look forward to the moment when I do croak. If I have any warning I’ll tut and say to myself, “Oh well, I knew this would happen sooner or later.”This kind of attitude is admittedly a disaster when it comes to wooing women. Assuming total failure ahead of any move made on the opposite sex is disastrous. It’s just not attractive.I’ve a friend who simply cannot imagine why any woman in the world wouldn’t desire him.Consequently, many women do desire him. I, on the other hand, simply cannot imagine why any woman would desire me. Consequently, they invariably don’t. But because I knew they wouldn’t, I’m not remotely downhearted.I’ve kept the company of positive people over the years. They have their uses. But expecting me to believe them when they say, “Don’t worry, it’ll all be fine”, is fanciful.And believing that from professional advisers can be absolutely calamitous.“Oh yes, Adrian, it’s all going to be fine.” And then, whatever it is, turns out not to be fine and they just shrug and say, “Oh dear, didn’t see that coming, pay me some more fees and I’ll make sure it’ll be all right in the end.”In my work as a journalist I’ve talked to many psychologists who speak of the power of positive thinking. Yeah, whatever. Maybe. But what I do know for sure is that I just can’t do it.When you’re standing on a golf course with a club in your hand addressing the ball, you’re supposed to envisage your perfect shot. For me, impossible.What I actually envisage, with complete clarity, is a truly dreadful shot.I can actually hear the ball smacking on to trees, or plopping into water. I’m living in the calamity.So at least when it happens, which is often, I can shrug and say, “Hmm, thought so.”All this may stem from supporting a team like West Bromwich Albion. I once told a priest, in all seriousness, that I suffered from deep despondence.When he asked me why I thought this was, I told him (as a joke) who I supported. He nodded gravely and said, “Yes, I see, I see.”I have a friend I travel with on the supporters’ coaches to away matches. The poor chap always thinks we’re going to win. Even at 2-0 down at half-time he’ll be sure we’ll emerge victorious.I challenged him once about these absurd delusions and he said: “Look, we all have the same journey home after a game. If we’ve won we’re both happy, if we lose we’re both sad. The difference is that I’ve had a much more enjoyable journey there than you.”That convinced me for a while. So the next game I tried being positive.And we lost. And it hurt more. So I went back to how I was.There’s only one route to happiness I can think of and it’s to be found in the lyrics of a song by the late Mose Allison: “I don’t worry ’bout a thing, ’cos I know nothing’s going to be alright.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

We looked at it and thought it could be a bomb.Its amazing. It is great to find such a piece of history when you are out looking for crabs. Its exciting.The Dambusters raid, also known as Operation Chastise, was one of the most difficult and famous missions of World War Two.Eight aircrafts were lost and 54 Commonwealth airmen were killed.Guy Gibson led 19 RAF Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron into the heart of Nazi Germany on the night of May 16-17 1943.They dropped bombs on three dams in the Ruhr Valley, in a bid to cause havoc in Hitlers industrial centre.The team blasted the dams, leaving water to swarm the surrounding ocuntryside, and much of Hitlers armement factories.Guy, the brave Wing Commander, made the first attack on Mohne Dam, but his bomb exploded short. Two aircrafts were shot down, but the RAF serviceman continued to attack as German soldiers fired.He was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.The Eder Dam was the next target, before the Sorpe Dam.The skilful nature of the mission was the inspiration for the 1955 film, The Dam Busters.They were dropped in top-secret test runs across Britain, including Wales, the Lake District and Kent.Only 11 of the 19 bombers that flew off to attack the Möhne, Edersee and Sorpe dams returned back to base.Dambusters expert Dr Hugh Hunt, a Reader in Engineering Dynamics \u0026amp Vibration at the University of Cambridge hailed the discovery as a piece of good British war history.Dr Hunt said: They did lots of testing around the county with these bombs filled with concrete because they could not use explosives.What has happened [to this bomb] is the steel has rusted away and you are left with the concrete.Some would have been recovered immediately after the tests they did as they did not want anybody to find out about the mission.In the years after the war it would have been hushed up. They did not do testing in places for very long because they did not want to spoil the surprise. They tested at night.This is quite an important find. I hope it goes somewhere useful.A similar prototype Dambusters bomb sits outside the Petwood Hotel in Lincolnshire, which was once home to the of the legendary RAF 617 “Dambusters” Squadron.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: HM Coastguard is currently investigating reports of ordnance found at Reculver, Herne Bay.At the moment the ordnance is covered by water but a Coastguard Rescue Team will be sent to investigate at the next low water, which is currently expected to be around 5pm today."},{"url":null,"title":"egypt ancient sphinx discovery valley of the kings","story":"The roadworks between the ancient temples of Karnak and Luxor have been halted after the large statue was discovered featuring a “lion’s body and a human head”.The relic could date as far back as 2500 BC and the reign of Pharoah Kafre.The Director General of Antiquities Mohamed Abel Aziz announced plans to excavate the statue, which is still buried in the ground and embedded in the soil.He added the process could take some time due to the age of the statue and the chances of damaging it after thousands of years.Mr Abel Aziz confirmed the new find had similarities to the “classical” Great Sphinx of Giza which stands 66ft tall in front of the Great Pyramids.Egyptian sphinxes are usually depicted as male but Greek ones are often female.The Egyptian ones are seen as benevolent, but possessing incredible strength, and seen as s and can often be seen outside the entrance to temples.Many believe the head of the sphinx at Giza to be the pharaoh Khafra.The oldest known sphinx was found near Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and is believed to date to 9500 BC.In Greek mythology, the sphinx was said to ask all passers-by the riddle: Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?The sphinx then is meant to have devoured anyone who could not answer.Oedipus, according to legend, finally solved the riddle by replying: Man—who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old ageKhaled al Anani, the national heritage chief, encouraged people to go and visit the site to see the new discovery.Local news website Youm reported that the statue could not yet be lifted above ground “due to the nature of the environment it is in.”The second sphinx was found just over six miles from the famous Valley of Kings – the burial place of the ancient Pharaohs.It was uncovered between two the temples on the opposite bank of the River Nile."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425761416.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"muslim actress sara khan trolled bikini photos","story":"TV actress and model Sara Khan, 29, recently posted pictures of herself on holiday in both Goa and Dubai.However the photos of the Muslim actress, who became famous for her part in the soap opera Sapna Babul Ka...Bidaai, did not go down well with some commentators who objected to her outfit.Some of her Instagram followers objected to her wearing a bikini and told her she should change her religion.One wrote: “I think you forget you are muslim..

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong attitude.Still - while they only dine in the best restaurants and holiday in the coolest destinations - how they can afford such incredible lifestyles is largely a mystery.Most of their accounts are private and they rarely go into what their families do to fund their globe-trotting, designer existences.But there have been young Central Asians who have openly flaunted their status and wealth on the world stage.They included glamorous billionaire Gulnara Karimova, the fashion designer daughter of late Uzbek dictator Islam Karamov, who disappeared from public view in 2014.She was often pictured next to A-listers including Jude Law and her designs featured at New York Fashion week until they ditched her over human rights abuses.Gulnara, always dressed in couture dresses and glimmering jewellery, also released a single and was known to have sung a duet with Latin heartthrob Julio Iglesias.Meanwhile, the son of former Kyrgyzstan president, is reported to live in a £3.5million mansion in Surrey while 31 per cent of his compatriots live below the poverty line.He was forced to flee the country in April 2010 after his father Kurmanbek Bakiyev was toppled following bloody nationwide riots.Maxim was so hated that protesters burned down his restaurant and luxury home in Bishkek the day after he left to seek asylum in the UK."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425856204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"photos abandoned mansion wales","story":"Crumbling walls, collapsed ceilings and dilapidated grounds, these grand houses, hospitals and halls are a shadow of what they once were. Many of these buildings are now overgrown, while some still have discarded scaffolding surrounding them.But all of these buildings are in urgent need of TLC.Here are some of Wales forgotten gems:The Mid Wales Hospital, originally the Brecon and Radnor Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, was a psychiatric hospital in Talgarth, Wales.It opened in 1903 and was one of more than 100 lunatic asylums in Britain with the last ward shut in 1999.The hospital was also home to the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery and an alcohol and drug abuse clinic.There have been many failed plans to redevelop the site.Hafodunos Hall is a Gothic revival house near the village of Llangernyw in Wales.It was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and built between 1861 and 1866 for Henry Robertson Sandbach.The grand hall was subject to a devastating fire in 2004 and the ruins are being restored.It is a Grade I listed building, with many of the buildings and structures in the grounds having their own listings.Clawdd Manor in Newport was owned by the Lyne family until the death of Colonel Cecil Lyne in 1979.The Edwardian building was then a successful B\u0026ampB before it started to fall apart.Baron Hill is in Beaumaris, Anglesey, and it fell into disrepair during World War I as the family couldnt afford to maintain the house.During the English Civil War, Richard Bulkeleys successor, Colonel Thomas Bulkeley, is said to have invited King Charles I to take possession of the house and set up his court there.Interestingly, parts of the park are sites of special scientific interest because the woodland has remained undisturbed for so long.It has a large range of lichen.This majestic castle in Abergele was built between 1819 and 1825 - and it has direct links to the British Royal Family.It was left to King George V by the Countess of Dundonald following her death in 1924.But local history claims that the first castle at Gwrych was built by the Normans in the 12th century.The castle was last open to the public in 1985 and has now been bought by the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which plans to restore it and open it to the public. The spooky looking Piercefield House -  located at St Arvans, in the Monmouthshire countryside - was built in the late 1700s.It was designed by British architect John Soane, who is the same man behind the Bank of England building.Iscoed, at Ferryside in Carmarthenshire, is a ruined eighteenth century mansion, which was listed for auction earlier this year.The crumbling mansion was designed by architect Anthony Keck.It was built for Sir William Mansel in 1772 and purchased by the Napoleonic general Sir Thomas Picton in 1812 - it remained in the family until the end of World War One.It was then used as council housing, but has been empty since the 1950s.This grand castle was one of the first of the mock castles to be built in Wales.It was built in 1626 by Sir Thomas Morgan, Steward to the Earl of Pembroke.And King Charles I spent two nights at Ruperra Castle in 1645, shortly after the Battle of Naseby.In September 2010, Ashraf Barakat put the building up for sale - at a whopping price of £1.5million - and the castle was sold in July 2014.This derelict house is in Llanychaer in Pembrokeshire.Despite its dilapidated exterior, its roof is intact.Richard Fenton described the house as “a handsome modern mansion” in the 1811 Tour of Pembrokeshire book.The grand Cornist Hall is a large house west-southwest of the town of Flint.It was the birthplace in 1746 of Thomas Totty, an admiral who served under Lord Nelson, including on  HMS Invincible.Most recently, it was used as a dining and wedding venue - until it closed its doors in 2013.Unfortunately, the site is often vandalised."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425907372.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"muslim convert admits planning to massacre 100 people on oxford street","story":"Lewis Ludlow, 26, carried out reconnaissance on potential targets including tourist hotspot Madame Tussauds and planned to mow down pedestrians.He hatched the plot in March and April after he was blocked from joining ISIS extremists in the Philippines.Ludlow, of Rochester, Kent, wanted to carry out a “multiple casualty vehicle-borne assault” in central London with the aim of killing more than 100 people.He had been due to stand trial but today admitted plotting an attack in the UK and funding ISIS abroad at the Old Bailey.A charge of attempting to join IS in the Philippines was left to lie on the file.The court heard Ludlow had sworn allegiance to ISIS as he prepared for the deadly massacre.He identified Oxford Street as an ideal target, writing: It is expected nearly 100 could be killed in the attack.Ludlow was arrested on April 18 by officers from Kents Counter Terrorism unit with his plans later found torn in pieces in a bin.Chilling notes included his plot to launch on Oxford Street using a van -

The Egyptian floated the business on the stock market again nine years later, minus Harrods, which had been its most valuable asset.By the late 1990s, struggling to compete with the new out-of-town shopping outlets that had lured shoppers away from the traditional high street locations from which it traded, House of Fraser was labouring under heavy debts.The solution of John Coleman, its chief executive at the time, was to strike a deal in July 1999 that saw the freeholds of 15 of the group\u0027s stores sold and then leased back.Unfortunately, a store freehold can only be sold once and the sale-and-leaseback agreement tied House of Fraser into some onerous rental agreements, some of which went out 40 years.In the meantime, the group continued to be a consolidator in the sector, snapping up rivals such as Beatties, the Midlands department store operator and Jenners, based in Edinburgh.Some, like Jenners and Dickins \u0026 Jones, have retained their names but, along the way, other famous old brands owned by House of Fraser have been replaced with the latter brand.The last Army \u0026 Navy stores, for example, were rechristened House of Fraser in 2005 stores previously trading under the name Binns, largely in the North East of England, were nearly all rebranded by 2006 and DH Evans was rebranded as long ago as 2001. These rebrandings in many cases severed a link between the stores and communities in which they had traded for many years and confused older shoppers.The next chapter came when, in 2006, House of Fraser was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur. The latter went bust three years later, in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland\u0027s economy, with Baugur\u0027s shares being scattered among a group of Icelandic banks.By then House of Fraser was in the middle of a turnaround under John King, the former Matalan boss, who had joined in early 2007 and Don McCarthy, an experienced retailer who became chairman under Baugur.But in 2013, the business changed hands again, being bought by the Chinese retailer Sanpower for a remarkable \u0026#163480m. Mr McCarthy left almost immediately and the talented Mr King, who had been promised the chairmanship by the new owners, left at the beginning of 2015 when that pledge went unfulfilled.The Chinese have proved to be as poor owners of House of Fraser as Mr Fayed was. Promised investment has never materialised, experienced managers have left the business and the group was left in no fit state to face either the hurricanes buffeting the high street or the intensification of competition as both John Lewis and Debenhams sought to respond to changing consumer tastes."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1536/skynews-homo-erectus_4385947.jpg?20180810135913 ","title":"mike ashleys sports direct buys house of fraser for 90m","story":"Details of Mr Ashley\u0027s plans for HoF, including how many of the 17,500 people who work for the company and its concession operators will keep their jobs, are unclear.However, a rescue deal by a well-capitalised business like Sports Direct will at least preserve a significant number of jobs at HoF.More than 6,000 roles had already been earmarked to be lost as part of a controversial process which was subject to a now-settled legal challenge from some of HoF\u0027s landlords.HoF had planned to close 31 of its 59 stores but because it entered administration those controversial Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), which allows companies to renegotiate contracts with creditors - and in this case landlords, drop away.Mr Ashley said: \"We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible.

Oh - and we\u0027ll be taking an extra \u0026pound100 off you, please. The pound hit a nine-month low against the Euro yesterday, trading at €1.10, as fears mount of a no-deal Brexit. Lots of things about leaving the EU sound like meaningless prophecies of doom. But if you like a cheap break abroad, the falling pound is something that actually hits your pocket. If you\u0027re planning a holiday in Europe this month, things will quite simply be more expensive.  We\u0027ve come a long way from the €1.30 exchange rate the night before Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. This week it\u0027s even down since mid-April, when it hit €1.16. Yes, there are ways a low pound can help Britain - making our exports more favourable, for instance. But you won\u0027t be thinking about that when you\u0027re forking out for a hotel on the Costa Del Sol. So we\u0027ve taken 10 things tourists might buy - and looked at how much more they cost since April and the 2016 Brexit vote. Please enjoy our gloriously depressing Brexit holiday guide. 1. 7-night luxury family hotel room in Alicante  Treat yourself to a seven-night stay in a luxury hotel in Spain. You\u0027ll be treating yourself to the tune of \u0026pound213 more than two years ago!

Meal in Rome with a cheap bottle of wine  A family restaurant meal in the Italian capital could easily set you back €90 - that\u0027s \u0026pound3 more than in April, or \u0026pound12 more than before the Brexit vote.  This week: \u0026pound81   Mid-April 2018: \u0026pound78   Night before the Brexit vote: \u0026pound69  3. Family ticket to Berlin Zoo  The German capital\u0027s zoo is world-famous and should set a family back €51. That\u0027s \u0026pound7 more than if the pound had held up its value.

Madrid-Seville high-speed train return  Get from the Spanish capital to a cultural capital in just a few hours - and with tickets for a family of four at around €329, it\u0027s almost \u0026pound50 than it would\u0027ve been under the old exchange rate in 2016.

On Saturday, March 20, 1993, the day before Mother\u0027s Day, an IRA bomb exploded without warning in a rubbish bin in Warrington\u0027s Bridge Street shopping area. Three-year-old Jonathan Ball was killed instantaneously. Moments later a second bomb exploded, seriously injuring 50 people and claiming the life of another child, 12-year-old Tim Parry, who died in hospital five days later after his parents, Colin and Wendy, had to take the unimaginable step of turning off his life-support machine. The reaction worldwide to what happened in Warrington was one of revulsion and locally anger was directed at the Irish community. Across the Irish Sea, however, the anger manifested itself into something unexpected and uplifting and it forms the basis of a new BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day.  The killing of the two innocent boys was a step to far for many who by their silence had supported the armed struggle. At the time Susan McHugh, then 37, was an ordinary wife and mother living in Clontarf, Dublin. After hearing of the Warrington tragedy, she said she felt the impulse to pick up the phone to book a hall at Trinity College, Dublin and later announced on the radio phone-in Liveline the holding of a protest meeting. She voiced her indignation as an Irish citizen about what had been committed in her name She asked people to join her at a public meeting at TCD on March 24 - 1,000 attended.  Her rallying speech At the time, the mum of two said: The IRA did not kill Johnathan Ball in my name or in your name. I want to tell the world tonight they did not kill him in the name of Ireland. There\u0027s nothing wrong with being emotional about a little baby\u0027s death. I feel horror, revulsion and sadness. But that\u0027s not enough. Tonight I feel anger. I feel angry and frustrated because the political will is not there to end the violence. We\u0027ve listened too long to rhetoric with no results. Sincere people will say everything has been tried. Maybe it\u0027s time it was looked at from a different angle.  Maybe it\u0027s time we asked for UN troops and independent arbitrators from Europe or the outside world. She appealed to politicians of all parties on both sides of the border. \u0027\u0027We demand an immediate peace plan . . . tonight is a night to remember,\u0027\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027We, the silent majority, say enough is enough.\u0027\u0027 The peace rally A peace rally in O\u0027Connell Street followed, attended by 20,000 people. It was a pivotal moment the launch of the Peace Consensus and a demonstration of people power, as journalist Bernie Ni Fhlatharta put it, that would do something the politicians had failed to do: kick-start the peace process and ultimately remake the political landscape of Northern Ireland. Across the country scores of people signed books of condolence in churches around Ireland and thousands of bouquets of flowers were transported by the Irish Air Corps to the funeral of Jonathan Ball. At one rally McHugh shouted: Please, please, please, make it stop! She was cheered by grim-faced people standing near the post office in the rain, many wearing white ribbons for peace.  Enough is enough In an interview before the demonstration she said: I\u0027m only saying what the majority of people in the country say. Enough is enough. We don\u0027t want any more deaths. We want a cease-fire. At the time she was lionized by the media as the leader of a new peace movement, but she insisted: I\u0027m an ordinary mum, a housewife. It was a dramatic time as the world searched for an end to violence and is seen by some as the moment peace seemed within reach. A year later the IRA announced a ceasefire, it was not to last, but it was the beginning of the end. Is Mother\u0027s Day true?  Now a BBC drama Mother\u0027s Day will tell the story of McHugh, played by Vicky McClure (Line of Duty, The Replacement) and Wendy Parry, played by Anna Maxwell Martin (Motherland, Good Omens) the mother of 12 year old Tim Parry who lost his life in the attack.

The 20-year-old was getting on a First Bus 24 from Easton to Bristol city centre when the driver launched in to a tirade about her clothing.  She was wearing a niqab, a veil that leaves the area around the eyes clear, and had just asked for the fare. But the driver asked her to remove the veil, insinuating she could  bomb the bus. “He said he couldn’t see my face, and that he didn’t know what I was ‘capable of doing’,” the mum, who asked not to be named, told Bristol Live . “He said I was scary and I was dangerous, and he kept talking about it during the journey. I didn’t say anything.  “He continued to insult me, and he made me out to be a terrorist, and kept saying everyone should see each other\u0027s faces. He asked why I was wearing a balaclava.” First Bus has now apologised, saying the driver had made a massive error. The mum added: “When we got to Primark, another woman asked me for my number and told me I should leave because I didn’t know how to deal with it. “I was on the bus and she said she would report him and asked for my number. “She started questioning him when I got off. “He was insinuating I was going to bomb the bus. How is that possible, when I’ve a baby with me?” After the bus stopped at the Haymarket, the mum got off before three other women decided to confront the bus driver. One of them was a woman wearing a hijab, a headscarf worn by Muslim women. The driver insisted he was right to ask her to remove her niqab, saying “the world was dangerous”, and that it was “not good”. The argument was filmed before he got off to speak to a manager and got back on the bus. The mum said: “It made me feel horrible and disappointed. I get that he might not be from the country, so maybe he has never seen a person with a face veil, but for him to treat me like that in a public place is wrong.  “I had my baby with me. I’ve been humiliated in public, and I’m disappointed. It’s 2018, we shouldn’t be like that. I’m being stereotyped.” The incident, which took place on July 1, has been reported to the police. First Bus only got back in touch with her to apologise after Bristol Live got in touch with the firm yesterday. She said: “First Bus hasn’t done anything about it and the way they’ve treated me is disgusting. I want to let people know what happened.

The scouse mum-of-four has told passenger Mark Chassin to get a life after he claimed his family was relegated to seats at the back of the aircraft, directly in front of pungent toilets which put them off their food. Coleen added: I didn’t ask for certain seats, just took what I was given. I am just a mum traveling with young kids like everyone else. Mark, 51, paid a total of \u0026pound2,735 for a return flight from Manchester Airport to Faro in Portugal for a family holiday - including \u0026pound60 to secure their preferred seats. But the dad of one was stunned to find he had been moved when a member of cabin crew allegedly told him Coleen needed to sit with everyone in her party.  His partner Lynn Waterhouse, 52, managed to snap a picture of Coleen, the wife of ex-England football captain Wayne Rooney, sitting in the seats they had reserved. The financial director says he pre-booked the row of six seats on the July 28 flight in January specifically to avoid being sat near the loo after a previous bad experience. He now alleges he, along with Lynn, his son Joshua, 15, dad Tom, 75, Lynn\u0027s sister Kathryn Pullar, 48, and her partner Richard Townend, 45, were treated differently to Coleen purely because he does not enjoy her celebrity status. But furious Coleen told her social media followers: The man who has gone to the press over this story...get a life, stop trying to pick on and drag down young women and their children. The man whose [sic] complaining with the very sarcastic attitude is trying to make me out as some diva... which I am far from... I didn\u0027t know about this situation.  A spokesperson for Jet2 said that Mark and his party were moved to the back row for \u0027safety and operational requirements\u0027 and that the company has given him a full refund for the seats. Coleen is believed to have been on a family holiday with her two brothers. The mum of Kai, eight, Klay, five, Cass, four, and Kit, two,was said to be completely unaware of the incident. Mark, from Denshaw, Greater Manchester, said: I booked the seats in January. We had a bad experience once of sitting near the toilets so we wanted to avoid that. Plus, we wanted to all be sat together. I went to print my boarding passes off about five weeks before and the seats were the same as what I had booked in the first place. I didn\u0027t find out we had been moved until we went to the check-in desk for our return journey. The lady on the check-in desk told us our seats had been changed and that we would have to have new boarding cards. She told us we had been moved to accommodate another passenger. I found it ridiculous. Unless it is for medical reasons or if a parent and child have been split up I don\u0027t understand why a whole row of us had to be moved for another passenger.  I spoke to one of the air hostesses and asked why we had been moved and she just pointed out that Coleen Rooney was on board and wanted all of her party to sit together. She had apparently booked a number of seats and wanted to be sat together. I was livid. We got on the plane and discovered we were near the toilets. It was fragrant. The team on board were trying their best and spraying air freshener but it didn\u0027t do much. We couldn\u0027t eat any food like we normally would because the smell was just so bad. I\u0027m not sure if Jet2 wanted to put her there so she wasn\u0027t near the toilet, but it could be seen that way. But it was obvious that we were moved to purely to accommodate her party. I think there was at least two or three rows of her party.  There was no reason to move us as we had paid for the seats and if they moved us to an empty row why wasn\u0027t she put there? She should have hired her own plane if she wanted everyone to sit together. I don\u0027t know why she is more important than us. If it was anyone else they would\u0027ve been told the seats were already booked up. I\u0027m glad we weren\u0027t sat too near to them though as one of the kids was a bit of a monster. He was kicking the chair in front and throwing his iPad around. After the flight Mark emailed Jet2 to complain but claims he only received an automated response. He believes his posts on social media helped him receive a full refund on the cost of his pre-booked seats from Jet2. However, Mark still feels as though he hasn\u0027t been given a satisfactory explanation from the airline.  Mark said: I sent an email the Sunday I got home to Jet2, but I just received a generic response. I started posting about it on social media and then I got offered a refund. I haven\u0027t been given a proper explanation. I think it is awful that she is treated better than us. We had booked and paid for those seats so to be moved because of this isn\u0027t acceptable. A spokesperson for Jet2 said: The aisle seats on the back row of our aircraft must be occupied by passengers aged 14 or above, so this move was necessary for us to meet safety and operational requirements, whilst keeping Mark and his family on the same row.

The pair moved into the home in Bilton, near Hull, with their children in the hope of a better life. But the plague has left them depressed and ruining the dream home they wished for.  More than 200 flies swarm their kitchen every day and some of the insects land on their faces at night, making it difficult to eat and sleep, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  Their house, along with others on the street, is close to the East Hull Community Farm, which the couple blame for the swarms of flies.  The farm says it has never had a complaint about flies and does everything in its power to limit the amount on the farm. But the couple believe livestock and manure bring the flies into their house. We have even been told by one neighbour that they\u0027ve had the problem with flies for the last 20 years, and there must be over 100 people that live down here and are struggling. The couple, who do not wish to be named, said they had health issues arising from the number of flies in their house. Our children have diarrhea from the flies as they are always landing on the food - I daren\u0027t even buy fresh food anymore for fear of the flies getting to it, they said.  This must be the only street that prays for winter - it was 52 degrees in the house the other day as we couldn\u0027t open any of the windows or doors for fear of more flies getting in. We started to decorate when we moved in, but have had to stop as the walls kept constantly getting covered in dead flies and were just covered in blood from where we had splattered them, so it was just a waste of time. The fly problem is affecting the health of the family, and is very traumatic for them.  It is just so horrible and is affecting us all mentally, as well as seeing it and coping with it physically, they said. The infestation is making me depressed and I just can\u0027t stand it going on any longer. It is an absolute joke, the temperature is soaring but we can\u0027t cool down, I don\u0027t want to get up on a morning to have to face it, and I can\u0027t get to sleep on a night as flies are just constantly landing on my face. We were happy to move to a big house with a big garden, but now we just don\u0027t want to be here anymore. We don\u0027t know how to get rid of the problem and have tried calling the farm, Environmental Health and the council, but we just keep getting passed from pillar to post. Hull City Council said: “We were contacted by the resident in July and we requested further information so that we could carry out an investigation into the cause of the problem. The resident supplied us with that information yesterday (August 7). We will be in touch with the resident with the results as soon as we get them. In terms of the cause of the problem, this cannot be determined until we have the results of the investigation.” To try and get rid of the flies, the unhappy couple are having to spend around \u0026pound50 per month on sprays and cleaning products, which is making a real dent into their finances.

She said one of the youths grabbed the cat by the scruff of the neck and hung it in front of an Alsatian dog - who then began mauling it to death.  The horrified 23-year-old said: It was absolutely horrendous. I just froze. I have never, ever witnessed anything like it in my life. It was disgusting.

She added: I always have a look out the window before I go to bed and I had seen a black and white cat sat on the doorstep of my neighbours house. I was just dozing off and heard this cat screaming and ran to the window and saw two lads, one on a yellow bike with a big, big Alsatian. And then he went over to the front door, grabbed the cat by the scruff of the neck and was just hanging it in-front of the dog\u0027s mouth. She added: The dog started literally ripping the cat to pieces. And the lads just weren\u0027t bothered. It made me sick in my mouth. It was literally awful. The mum said at that point her neighbour rushed out of the house in a bid to stop the lads - who ran off. The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she tried to save the cat - which had severe injuries to its neck and stomach - and rushed it to the emergency vets.  However she told the ECHO the cat has since died.

Alisha Watts, 18, a student at the selective Kendrick School in Reading, had struggled with violent mood swings for years, an inquest heard. She was found dead by her social worker, Leanne Palethorpe, who had rushed to her home after receiving a series of worrying emails. She was found slumped against a wall, wrapped in a duvet and clutching her teddy bear after taking her own life. Above her were detailed notes to her family and a playlist titled \u0027suicide\u0027 was playing.  Described as \u0027beautiful and loved\u0027 by her friends and family, Alisha had told Leanne that she was feeling the worst she had felt in a long time. She had also thanked her for everything that she had done and for being so kind. Assistant coroner for Berkshire, Alison McCormick, described the suicide as one that was a careful and meticulously planned suicide.   The coroner heard how Alisha had been repeatedly in and out of care facilities from the age of 15, after her mum had become increasingly worried about her repeated claims of feeling suicidal.    Between the ages of 15 and 18 when had been moved between multiple care units and services including from Southampton Priory, to Prospect Park hospital before being settled at a supported living facility in Reading, Berks.     In an emotional statement, social worker Ms Palethorpe said : Alisha was very, very easy to engage, she would contact me all the time and she felt it was helpful to email me late at night when she was having issues.    She had started to become a lot more positive, she told me she could see a way out, she could see her future and sh was making plans for her future.    She would often tell me that she just wanted to be a normal girl in a normal life.    Her risk assessments were very difficult because here emotions would swing so wildly, the assessments were only relevant for the times they were done, but she could change within the hour.

Experts have revealed our subconscious scribblings can show we have a selfish side, are feeling the pressure at work – and even that we\u0027ve got skeletons in our cupboards. The shapes and objects drawn, the colour of ink used and the position of the scribble on the page can all provide clues into our state of mind, life outlook, motivations and more. An arch shape for instance can indicate someone is secretive, while retraced doodles – going over your doodle in the same spot – are often a sign of being overworked. Criss-crosses can be a sign of anxiety, straight lines suggest someone is a ‘no nonsense’ type and pointed shapes can indicate an ambitious and competitive nature.  The hidden meanings were revealed after makers of the 4 Colours pen, BIC, teamed up with doodle expert and consultant graphologist, Tracey Trussell, to launch their Design and Shine competition. As part of the launch BIC also commissioned research among 2,000 UK adults and found we doodle four times a week on average - for 15 hours a year in total. Tracey Trussell, said: “Doodles are like little maps that guide us in the exploration of people\u0027s psyches. “They are created casually - usually when the doodler is concentrating on something else - by the complete free-flow of uninhibited symbols, \u0027live and direct\u0027 from the subconscious.  “This means they\u0027re the outward expression of our unconscious thoughts, and not intended for any particular recipient or for any specific use.” The research found two thirds doodle when they are bored, one fifth do it when they’re anxious or stressed - and one quarter do it when they are in relaxed state of mind. Two thirds also think doodles can reveal a lot about someone’s personality, which could explain why 35 per cent avoid letting others see their scribbles.  The most popular forms of doodle are shapes and patterns – 69 per cent draw in this way. Circles and round shapes typically indicate someone is friendly and kind - this type of doodler is also motivated by love and they don’t like conflict. Squares are often indicative of those who like organisation and to be in control - and tend to have meticulous planning skills. Triangles and pointed shapes are usually drawn by ambitious people – those who will stop at nothing to achieve their goals and dreams. This shape can also indicate someone is competitive and resourceful but might also suggest someone has an abrasive personality. One fifth of the population tend to doodle recognisable objects such as flowers, houses, stars and faces.  Flowers are the most popular recognisable objects drawn and tend to suggest someone is loyal and faithful – and that friendships and relationships matter to them. A large circular centre flower shows confidence and is indicative of someone who likes attention. However carefully drawn flowers suggest someone has an obsessive-compulsive personality. The second most popular objects sketched are stars – and as they contain points they can indicate someone is ambitious. Those who doodle in this way have high expectations and aspirations in life – and are determined to succeed. Faces are the third most favoured and can indicate a host of things depending on what form they take. For instance, self-portraits can indicate someone is egocentric, but drawing other faces is often indicative of someone who is more of a people’s person.  But it’s not just what you doodle which provides insight into someone’s personality or outlook on life. Those who do large doodles want to be noticed whereas smaller doodlers enjoy the quiet life and are modest types. Drawing the same shape or object over and over again – but not on the same spot – reveals patience and perseverance. Doodling on the same spot is an indication of anxiety, and is often drawn when people are under pressure – it can also be a sign of guilt. Shaded or filled doodles can simply mean someone is bored, but can also indicate they are unhappy, have bottled-up anger or lack self-confidence. Used by two thirds of Brits, black is the most popular ink colour for doodling – and this choice of colour often suggests someone is decisive and hardworking.  Blue ink – typically used by 17 per cent – often suggests someone is peaceful and patient. Red is commonly used by energetic, passionate individuals, and green is the choice of eccentrics. The use of brighter colours such as yellow and orange often indicate someone is fun and frivolous – with a vivid and creative imagination. Nearly a quarter take pride in what they sketch and keep their old doodles. In fact, 24 per cent think their doodles are good enough to be considered works of art. Tracey Trussell added: “Doodling helps you to focus and concentrate on whatever you\u0027re doing.  “It\u0027s effective for problem solving and it\u0027s also a source of creativity and brilliant for brainstorming, because it\u0027s a conduit for ideas and light bulb moments. “It\u0027s also a way of helping to process difficult emotions - doodles are like safety valves for releasing negative emotions and feelings.” BIC is offering doodlers aged 13 plus the chance to have their drawings appear on the iconic 4 Colours pen.

The hot weather has led to rice, maize and other crops withering in the fields, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said today. The world\u0027s largest disaster relief network warned of a risk of a full-blown food security crisis in the isolated country, saying that the worrying situation had been exacerbated by international sanctions imposed due to North Korea\u0027s nuclear and missile programmes. There had been no rainfall since early July as temperatures soared to an average 39C across the country, whose official name is the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and the next rain was expected in mid-August, it said.  The population of 25 million is already stressed and vulnerable with malnutrition among children that could worsen, it said in a statement issued in Geneva. This is not yet classified as a drought, but rice, maize and other crops are already withering in the fields, with potentially catastrophic effects for the people of DPRK, said Joseph Muyamboit, its programme manager in Pyongyang.  We cannot and must not let this situation become a full-blown food security crisis, he said. We know that previous serious dry spells have disrupted the food supply to a point where it has caused serious health problems and malnutrition across the country. The Federation was helping the national Red Cross to support 13,700 of the most vulnerable people at risk. It had deployed emergency response teams and 20 water pumps to irrigate fields in the hardest-hit areas, it said.  David Beasley, the head of the UN\u0027s World Food Programme (WFP), visited North Korea in May to look into boosting food distributions to hungry women and children, in the latest sign of an opening. About 70 percent of North Koreans are food insecure, meaning they struggle to avoid hunger, and one in four children under five is stunted from chronic malnutrition, the WFP said at the time.

It took just minutes for the inferno to burn the church to the ground, and authorities suspect it may have been caused by arson.

I think he is perfect for Scottish football.“When I signed him before he was very good for me and he got his move to Aalborg on the back of that.“He has trained with us now but he is still a player at Aalborg so it is in the hands of the two clubs.”Safranko made 28 appearances for AaB last season but has dropped to the bench for the early games of this term after a formation change.That’s prompted him to seek a regular starting place elsewhere in a bid to add to his two Slovakia caps and he sees teaming up with his old boss again as the perfect way to achieve that.Although United have not ruled out a move for Austrian attacker Toni Vastic after his trial last week, with Safranko not coming cheap, that now looks unlikely.Csaba, meanwhile, has apologised to fans for his team’s poor showing in Saturday’s defeat against Dunfermline.He’s made it clear the display that led to three second half goals being conceded at Tannadice was unacceptable.“I have to apologise to the fans, for all the people who like and love Dundee United, for the performance and the result on Saturday.“The second half was nowhere near good enough, it wasn’t acceptable,” he added.“It was not what the fans, the staff and even the players wanted.“The players told me, gaffer we have to go and really tell everybody sorry but I take the responsibility.“Of course, we know every team can lose games but we know we should not lose like we did in the match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united have to start getting it right from now on says edjenguele","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith so many changes to the squad taking place over the summer, experienced defender William Edjenguele knows it was always going to take new-look Dundee United time to gel.However, the experience the 31-year-old has amassed over his career and, in particular, of life in the Championship over the past two seasons with the Tangerines, tells him they better find a way to do it quickly.Like every other United player, the big Frenchman was gutted by Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline in their league opener.It goes without saying that loss was not what the incumbents of the Tannadice dressing-room wanted or expected.“It was the first game of the season and at home, so you want to start well and that’s what we didn’t do,” he said.“In the first half we didn’t play particularly well but we managed to get the first goal and it looked the kind of game where the team who got it would be the winner.“And I thought in the first half, while we were not playing that well, neither team was. However, we were showing togetherness and real fight.“Second half there were a few mistakes and that cost us the game.“We were a bit unlucky as well because there was a handball in the move for their second goal and it should have been a foul for us.“You can’t use that as an excuse because he (the referee) did not give it and you have to defend the situation.”Neither will Edjenguele use the vast changes to the squad over the summer to deflect from what fans had a right to expect to be a much better start.The weekend saw nine men in tangerine making their league debuts for the club.That meant only two of the team that beat the Pars over two legs in the promotion play-off quarter-final just last May, were involved in the United starting line-up.Having been at eight clubs in his 13-year senior career, he knows better than most that any new group needs time to get to know each other and that’s definitely the case at Tannadice where he’s never seen so many comings and goings in such a short period.He’s well aware, however, that, while that process could take two or three months, it cannot be at the expense of results.“Definitely it will take time. I don’t even know how many players exactly came in but it was a lot.“There were a lot of changes, so we definitely need some time to gel together.“And I should say I do respect Dunfermline. They are a good side, especially going forward, and they have some decent players. So if you don’t play well they can beat you.“At home you expect us to do a bit better than that. Everybody is disappointed but we have to go again.“It was a hard day but we have to make sure we are better right away because the one thing that you find out is the season goes by fast and we have to be ready to go quickly.“We have to play better, starting with the next game. It’s as simple as that.”After the struggles of the Betfred Cup group that saw United come out on top in just one of their four ties and even then only after they already knew they were out of the competition, it’s fair to say many supporters feared the worst going into the Dunfermline clash.Edjenguele, though, insists the players had been in confident mood.The feeling was they were coming together as a team and would be ready for the opening 90 minutes of league action. That, of course, only made defeat more painful.“Some of the results in the cup were not good until the Elgin game,” he said.“We were making progress and things were moving in the right direction, so this was a real setback.“Like I say, now we must work to make sure we are ready this week.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee striker a jay leitch smith joins english league two side","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee striker A-Jay Leitch-Smith has joined Morecambe on a one-year contract.The Englishman scored seven goals in 32 appearances for the Dark Blues last term after joining up on loan from Shrewsbury.He returned to his parent club at the end of last season, but now he’s made a permanent switch to the League Two side in Lancashire.“A-Jay’s a player that I’ve always been impressed with.

He’s got the character to brush this off and against Aberdeen on Saturday, he’ll have no qualms going back in there and making saves.“Fans can be very fickle and obviously as a keeper mistakes are highlighted because they cost goals but Jack has the ability to go and be a hero this week.“In pre-season he obviously did something right to convince Neil McCann to put him in and take over from Elliott Parish.“Neil took Jack into the club to play and one mistake isn’t going to change that.“Over the course of the season I have no doubt he’ll save more points for Dundee than he’ll cost them.”Soutar admits Hamilton is suffering the “life of a goalie” at the moment, a position where an error more often than not leads to conceding a goal.However, as a Dundee fan himself, Soutar is backing the Dens faithful to get behind their new keeper this weekend and manager Neil McCann to stick with Hamilton between the posts.“Everybody makes mistakes and there will be some supporters who will be on your back from the first minute but as a goalkeeper you just have to go back in and make saves for your team,” he added.“Dundee fans, though, always forgive – it’s a speciality of the Dee support.“He lost the ball and lost a goal but if he goes and megs a boy on Saturday everybody will love him!“I think the manager will stick with him – it highlights the error more if he makes a switch.“Neil had obviously seen enough in Jack to start him this season and I think he should stick by that decision, at least for the first few games.“I had a terrible week myself at Dunfermline when Jim Duffy was manager at Dens – he could’ve dropped me but he stuck by me and I ended up being Man of the Match against Motherwell the next week.“The worst thing for Jack would be to drop him – let him get it out of his system and go play.“It’s the life of a goalie – everyone forgets the good stuff when you make a mistake.”Getting used to a new way of playing takes every player a bit of time to adjust – with the league campaign already under way, however, Soutar admits Hamilton will need to get used to playing out from the back quickly.“At Hearts over the last few years, the team has been a more physical side rather than the footballing team Dundee like to be.“Jack has to adapt to that very quickly, though. The manager likes to play out from the back and he’ll have to get used to it.“Sometimes, though, as a goalie when you’re under pressure, you just have to stick it in row Z and deal with the flak afterwards.“Jack will learn from it, though.“It’s still early days for him. It’s only one game and I’d back him to put in a performance on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b6c2727efb71.jpg ","title":"shock as

walls in blue pen.Numerous floors in the communal stairwell appeared to have been targeted during the vandalism spree.Messages, including “God is power and heroin is a sin” and “Satan lives here”

Gate Church elder explained they did not condone damage of property by graffiti or any other means.The spokesman said: “Our church is committed to protecting our environment and the community around us and invests in projects that sustain and improve the area.“This Christian faith is a message of love and not hate towards those around us.“The messages written do not reflect our values or faith correctly.”A tenant at the block added: “These messages have appeared within the last two to three days.“It is a bit bizarre, if not a wee bit unsettling.“Some are proclaiming Satan lives here, telling people they will burn in hell.“This type of stuff has been written on walls on a number of floors.“It’s certainly not the usual type of vandalism we would expect to see.“We normally have drug

reasons to reject the plan.After a two-hour site visit by councillors, also attended by more than 50 local objectors, planning committee members returned to Inverness to discuss the application

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors.

There’s been an increase in people considering a career in early learning or childcare.”The former languages teacher also said that the council must “get it right for every child”.

Dyce.During a consultation process, 283 people wrote to the council formally objecting to the proposal and 36 wrote in support of it.Now, council planning officer Matthew Easton has recommended a public hearing should be held so everyone can have their say.In a new report, Mr Easton said: “Given the significant level of objection and the nature of the matters raised, it is considered the most appropriate manner of addressing these concerns is to convene a hearing at which all parties will have an opportunity to state their views in front of the elected members of the planning development management committee.”The committee is to meet at the Town House next Thursday to make a decision.If members vote for a public meeting, feedback from it would feature in a council report.Some objectors have expressed concerns that roads, schools and GPs could struggle to cope with extra residents.Dr Bill Harrison, of Dyce and Stoneywood Community Council, said: “The community council objects to this application.“It is not consistent with council planning policy.“The massing and bulk of five closely-spaced multi-storey blocks constitutes overdevelopment of the site – the ‘inner-city’ style blocks are totally unsympathetic to the low-density housing in Dyce village and will have an unacceptable impact on the character and amenity of the surrounding area.”A report sent to the council on behalf of First Endeavour said: “Council policy seeks a range and mix of house types and sizes to cater for a range of occupiers.“The development proposal is fully in line with this, as it has been specifically designed to provide council housing to meet an identified need in Aberdeen. It comprises 32% one-bed two-person flats, 52% two-bed four-person flats, 11% three-bed six-person flats and 3% four-bed eight-person plats.“This presents a clear emphasis on one and two-bed

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 9:27 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,As usual with Councillor Redman, he was so desperate to berate the SNP in his letter published in the July 20 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser that he is unable to see the hypocrisy of his own stance.He talks of \u0026#8216stealth taxes\u0026#8217 hitting \u0026#8216the most vulnerable people in our society, particularly elderly people living alone\u0026#8217.His accusation of \u0026#8216taking their eye off the day job\u0026#8217 begs the question as to where he was when the Tory government introduced its bedroom tax \u0026#8211 a tax on those who needed an extra room for live-in carers, a tax on grandparents who wanted to have their grandchildren to stay for weekends and at holiday times a tax on widows with sons and daughters in the armed forces expected to sleep on a sofa when home on leave.A disgraceful tax which the SNP government abolishedDavid Hay, MinardSir,It was superb to once again meet up with locals in Whitehouse and across west Kintyre. As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dancer wins big at southend games","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 7:13 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTen-year-old Olivia Veitch was celebrating with her family after an amazing performance at Southend Games.The highland dancer won first place in Highland Laddie, Barracks Johnnie and Reel of Tulloch and second place in Seann Triubhas and Highland Fling, also winning the overall intermediate section.The dancer from Lochgilphead dances at the James McCorkindale School of Dancing in Campbeltown.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sea unites the story of inverarays ferry","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/08/18, 8:55 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Colin CameronMuch of the detail in this feature comes from two booklets written by the late Donald MacKechnie, the well-known Inveraray schoolmaster and local historian.The booklets, \u0026#8216Inveraray Notes\u0026#8217 and \u0026#8216Inveraray Tales and Traditions\u0026#8217, were published in the 1980s.Look out for tales from these fascinating booklets in coming editions of the Argyllshire Advertiser.As a starter, we turn to links across Loch Fyne, and the Inveraray-St Catherines ferry.Based on information by Donald MacKechnieFrom the Middle Ages until 1963 a ferry sailed between Inveraray and St Catherines \u0026#8211 one of seven similar services up and down Loch Fyne linking Cowal and Mid Argyll. Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"food music and fun at tayvallich weekend gala","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 7:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTayvallich was the place to be last weekend when the annual village gala was celebrated in style.The Tayvallich Weekend is the main fundraiser for Tayvallich Village Hall, which is preparing for a major redevelopment.The festivities kicked off on Friday evening with a barbecue at the Tayvallich Inn. This was a chance for villagers and visitors to get together to share food and drink, with musical entertainment from Paisley singer/songwriter Alan McKim.A wet start to Saturday July 28 failed to deter the enthusiasm of the crowds who converged on Tayvallich Village Hall for fun activities such as children’s sports, a bouncy castle and a pop-up crazy golf course that kept adults and children amused. The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998. Former pupils from Marr College took to the dance floor at the Marine Hotel last Saturday night to celebrate their 20-year reunion – those who would have started at the Troon school in 1992. There was lots of great banter, reminiscent 90s music and some interesting moves on the dancefloor. People had been sending old photos of themselves from back in the day which was collated into a slideshow. This ran throughout the night, showing that some people had hardly changed at all! Former pupils travelled from all over Scotland to meet old friends, some even came from England, America and as far a Hong Kong to join in the fun. It was a great night enjoyed by all those in attendance. A glass was raised to those from the year group who are no longer here and a “just giving” page was created for donations to be made to Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation in their memory. DJ Steven James, was one of the pupils from the year group and did a great job spinning the decks and taking everyone back two decades. The event was staged by the now Lynda McFarlane, Mhairi Lammie (Miller) and Vicki Cameron. Mhairi said: “Several months of planning by a small dedicated group of former pupils paid off spectacularly. “My only complaint is that the evening was over all too quickly.” Ben Glasgow added: “It was fantastic meeting up with so many people from our year group in the same room at the one time. “The dancefloor and bar did very brisk business.” DJ Steven James summed it up when he said: “It was slightly surreal looking out at a dance floor full of people that I hadn’t seen in such a long time. “By the end of the night, I felt like any barriers or negative preconceptions had been broken down. It’s amazing what a little progressive samba (and alcohol) can do.” Do you have a human interest story that you would like to feature in the Ayrshire Post then give us a call on 01292 294463Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonSchoolsUniversities and CollegesEducationAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"disruption-expected-as-resurfacing-starts-on-earlston-high-street","story":"MOTORISTS in Earlston can expect disruption from tomorrow as a major resurfacing programme begins.\nThe works on the section of the A6105 road will take place for eight days from Wednesday, August 1, to Friday, August 10, with the route fully open on Saturday and Sunday.\nPhase one will see a section of the eastern end of the High Street closed for three days from 8.30am to 5pm.\nAnd phase two will be carried out using a convoy system from next Monday to Friday between 8.30am and 5pm.\nThe official diversion is via the A68, B6362, A697, A6089 and A6105 for eastbound, with the reverse route for westbound traffic.\nParking restrictions will also be in place on the High Street during the works from 8am to 5pm.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure, said: \u0026ldquoEarlston High Street is an important route not just for local residents and businesses but as the A6105 is one of the main roads from the west to the east through the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThis resurfacing programme will vastly improve the road in Earlston, and with only a short-term daytime closure required.\n\u0026ldquoAll road users are asked to follow signed diversions during the three day closure, and allow themselves some extra journey time throughout the works.\nBus services will also be disrupted during the works.\nFrom tomorrow to Friday, service 60 will divert from Earlston bus stance via the A68 to Lauder, B6362, A697 to Greenlaw.\nService 60 from Greenlaw to Earlston will follow the same diversion.\nDuring this diversion a demand-responsive shuttle bus service will be provided by EAJ Robertson to connect with service 60 at both Earlston and Greenlaw for customers affected by the road closure.

become even trickier.\nMislabelling several years ago led to the Abies koreana being planted in the wrong place at Dawyck Botanic Garden, near Stobo.\nAnd as it gradually approached full height experts realised it was the odd one out when compared with its neighbours on the hillside gardens.\nAhead of the busy autumn period at Dawyck the arborists decided a new location was needed for the

tasks.\n\"The tree in question, an Abies koreana or Korean fir, is one of a very handsome species occurring naturally in the higher mountains of South Korea at altitudes of around 1500 metres.\n\"The reason it was moved dates back to an error during propagation when it was mislabelled.\n\"It had then been planted out along with its \u0026lsquofriends\u0026rsquo but in time turned out to be the odd one out.\n\"In order to clear up the issue of it being in the wrong place we took the decision to move it somewhere more appropriate.\"\nHaving now been replanted in a more appropriate location with the picturesque gardens, the Korean fir appears to have happily taken root.\nAnd Mr Stewart admits the move proved popular with the many visitors.\nHe added: \"It appears quite happy in its new home.\n\"Visitors seem to enjoy watching this kind of activity and it is a great way to start conversations about what we do and why we do it.\"\nAfter a busy summer at the botanical garden, staff at Dawyck are gearing up for a busy autumn.\nA packed-programme of events are planned, including on Sunday, September 16 when mycologist Neville Kilkenny, an expert in the distinct kingdom of fungi, will

for the complete renovation has not been obtained.\n\"So we are developing a phased plan of redevelopment to convert the previous steading building into a caf\u0026eacute to serve the local community

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The main events begin with the traditional Kirkin Sunday for the official party, with the procession to St Michael\u0026rsquos Church, Inveresk, getting under way at 1.30pm for the service at 2pm.  Among those taking part in the Kirkin this year are the Honest Lad and Honest Lass from 50 years ago: Frank Grant and Kay Gifford.  The sashing of the Honest Lad and Lass also takes place on Sunday on the green beside the Hayweights Clock by the River Esk, opposite Tesco, at 4.15pm.  This year\u0026rsquos sasher is Musselburgh Grammar School\u0026rsquos headteacher Colin Gerrie.  The ever-popular Crusaders\u0026rsquo Chase on Monday is earlier this year, with horses and riders fording the River Esk near the Roman Bridge at 5.45pm instead of 6pm, followed by a duck race.  This year, the Club Captain is Scott Nisbet. The riders will form at Inveresk Industrial Estate at 5.30pm.  The Crusaders\u0026rsquo Chase night dance is then held at 9.30pm at Eskmills Bowling Club.  This year, a new film about the lives of the Fisherrow fishwives, which was screened at The Brunton to celebrate International Women\u0026rsquos Day, is shown again at the Baptist Church in New Street on Tuesday at 7.30pm.  The Fishwives of Fisherrow \u0026ndash Preserving the Heritage of a Lost Community was commissioned by the Fisherrow Waterfront Group and paid for by the Heritage Lottery Fund.  Musselburgh Athletic is also organising a football tournament the same night at Olive Bank at 6.30pm.  Tuesday also witnesses the Junior Rideout, which departs from Inveresk Industrial Estate at 6pm.  While on Wednesday the free family fun day is held at Lewisvale Park between noon and 4pm.  Also on the day is the presentation night, at 7pm at The Brunton.  Then next Thursday (July 26), events include the festival tea dance at The Brunton, from 2pm to 4pm, as well as the community concert.  Next Friday (July 27) sees the hugely popular fancy dress parade take place, setting off at 7pm.  Judging takes place from 6.15pm, at Ashgrove for vehicles and at King Street/Loretto playing fields for pedestrians.  The parade is followed by the fancy dress disco at 8.30pm in Musselburgh Rugby Club.  The climax of the festival is next Saturday (July 28) with the Rideout, which leaves Pinkie Pillars at 9am.  That is followed by the Festival Day picnic at Musselburgh Racecourse and the Festival Ball at The Brunton at 7pm.  Waterfront Family Day next Sunday (July 29) brings the festival to a close, including a raft race and harbour ceremony which will herald the end of the festival.

And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.

But while Musselburgh\u0026rsquos research showed a high number of off-sales operating in the town, in North Berwick the map was red because of the number of licensed premises such as restaurants and pubs.  A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.  However, it also revealed that, in general, the county performed far better than Scotland\u0026rsquos national average when it came to alcohol-related health harm and crime. The average crime rate in East Lothian is 218.7 per 10,000 population, 34 per cent lower than the Scottish average of 331.2 per 10,000 population.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

DAY NINE: TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT NEWS  WITH just three medal events taking place across the city today, transport should be as close to normal as we\u0026rsquove seen it since the games began last week.\u0026nbsp  The biggest source of transport disruption will come from the BMX cycling qualifier event in Knightswood park.\u0026nbsp  Roads surrounding the area, including Great Western Road and Lincoln Avenue, are expected to be much busier than normal throughout the day, while parking restrictions are also in place.  Scotstounhill railway station is also expected to experience more congestion than normal, particularly between 10am and 2pm as hundreds make their way to and from the BMX event.\u0026nbsp  Bus services through Glasgow City Centre and near to Glasgow Green are set to be busy, especially into the evening, as city residents celebrate the end of another day of sport with Festival 2018.\u0026nbsp  Looking ahead to the weekend, Saturday is expected to be fairly quiet with much of the roads and public transport understood to be carrying on as normal.  It will be slightly busier around Knightswood and Loch Lomond as BMX and open water swimming events get underway.  However, Sunday marks the return of the road cycling events through the city centre.  Dozens of roads are expected to close with bus services diverted throughout Glasgow and surrounding areas.  Advice is to leave the car at home and use public transport where possible.

The business, which has been providing freshly baked products to Scots ever since its founder opened his first store nearly 120 years ago, has previously said competition from big supermarkets combined with increased costs of ingredients and distribution meant the business could not survive.    The latest closures come just two days after the Renfrew, Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr stores were shut down with the loss of 26 staff.  The liquidators have said the remaining 18 Thomas Auld \u0026amp Sons Limited stores across Scotland \"continue to trade\" while the provisional liquidators seek to sell some or all of the stores to \"enhance value for creditors and safeguard as many jobs as possible\".  Paul Dounis, RSM restructuring advisory partner and provisional liquidator said: \"Regrettably, we have had to close a further four stores to reduce losses which has resulted in a further 23 employees being made redundant.

The policy has seen members of the Windrush generation of West Indian immigrants told to leave the country because they lacked official documentation, provoked a row over the planned eviction of hundreds of would-be refugees in Glasgow and complaints from the director of the leaders of Edinburgh\u0027s international festivals over heavy-handed treatment of visiting artists under Home Office Rules.  In an open letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, the churches describe the \"hostile environment\" as a web of government policies designed to make life so difficult for people who cannot prove they have the right to live in the UK that they will choose to leave. They warn the system is inhumane,unjust, and is causing racist discrimination.  The letter calls fror a full independent review of the immigration rules and how they are being enforced.

Ms Sturgeon is due to update Holyrood on her plans for a referendum in October.  Last year, after resetting her original plans after SNP general election losses, she said she would set out a \u0026ldquoprecise timetable in the autumn.  However with continued confusion over the terms of Brexit and potential delays in talks, she admitted this week that she didn\u0026rsquot know what she would say.  Speaking to the BBC in Aberdeen, Mr Wheelhouse was asked about the likelihood of a second referendum being called in the current circumstances.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe First Minister said she will review the situation in October.  \u0026ldquoClearly, the chances of that happening are higher the more the UK government pushes us down a line of no deal and cutting our ties to\u0026hellip the European single market.  \u0026ldquoPeople who are not necessarily sympathetic to the SNP are increasingly angry with the position the UK government has taken and the risk of a \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo is focusing people\u0027s minds on perhaps the better opportunities there may be through independence.\"  The pound rebounded on Thursday after a report EU leaders were mulling a compromise that would avoid a no-deal by letting the UK opt out of free movement, but stay in the single market for goods.  However the idea came with a big catch.  In return for the EU dropping its resistance to cherry picking parts of the single market, the UK would have to replicate all future EU rules on environment, customs and social protection.  As this would effectively prevent the UK \u0026ldquotaking back control, the trade-off is unlikely to be backed by Westminster, but it does at least suggest an openness to new thinking.  Meanwhile, Theresa May has been forced to reassure Conservative party members that her Chequers plan for a soft Brexit is not a sell-out to Brussels.  In a three-page letter addressing the \u0026ldquostrong feelings in the rank and file, the Prime Minister insisted her proposals were \u0026ldquoin no sense a concession to the EU.  However she also said Brexit \u0026ldquorequires pragmatism and compromise from both sides.  The exercise, estimated to have cost the Tory party around \u0026pound70,000, comes amid a grassroots backlash to the Chequers deal, which would see the UK maintain a common rule book with the EU on goods and agri-foods, but diverge on services and migration.  David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary and Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary after the plan was agreed last month, and it has been criticised by other Brexiters as a betrayal.  Mrs May admitted \u0026ldquoparty members have raised a number of questions about her plan for a bespoke deal, and she wanted to \u0026ldquoaddress them directly.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know that some people are concerned that this common rule book will stop us doing trade deals. I can assure you that this is not the case - and I would not be proposing it if it would.  She acknowledged a common rule book \u0026ldquowould mean we could not drop our regulatory standards for goods in new trade deals with other countries, but said the government didn\u0026rsquot want to do that anyway, as it wanted to \u0026ldquoprotect British consumers.  \u0026ldquoI am well aware of the strong feelings members of our Party have on this national issue.  In recent weeks, Downing Street has held briefing sessions for Tory branch chairs, with Mrs May taking part in a conference call Q\u0026ampA with association chairmen.  She insisted the UK would take back control of its money, laws and borders and begin \u0026ldquoan exciting new chapter in our nation\u0026rsquos history.  She rejected both the EU\u0026rsquos options, saying one would mean a separate status for Northern Ireland and \u0026ldquobreak up the UK, which was unacceptable to her as a \u0026ldquoproud Unionist.  She also said Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area would continue free movement, \u0026ldquovast annual payments and alignment with EU rules.  She said: \u0026ldquoI remain clear that no deal is better than a bad deal - and we are stepping up our \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo preparations.

He said the language was experiencing a \u0026ldquoshift in emphasis away from its heartlands and towards the Central Belt as populations continue to plummet in Scotland\u0026rsquos most rural areas.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe numbers are growing in the cities and the bigger towns all the time. And that contrasts quite significantly with the economic situation \u0026ndash not just in the Western Isles, but in other areas of the Highlands as well.  It comes as a series of commitments aimed at boosting the strength of Gaelic were unveiled at a milestone meeting of public bodies chaired by Deputy First Minister John Swinney.  This includes plans to publish the first ever Gaelic tourism strategy this autumn to help bring visitors into contact with the language.  Officials also want to increase the number of school subjects which can be taught in Gaelic.  Mr MacDonald said the new plans represented a \u0026ldquomajor investment of time, energy and resources.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a recognition of the important of Gaelic language and culture to the tourism industry. In effect that\u0026rsquos also a recognition of the place of Gaelic in the economy of Scotland.  He said recent figures indicating the population of the Western Isles could plummet by as much as 14 per cent in the next 20 years were a \u0026ldquoreality check, but new plans sought to reverse the tide and strengthen Gaelic-speaking rural communities.  Mr Swinney said the Scottish Government had set out a \u0026ldquoclear mandate for the support of Gaelic.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis meeting shows that there are a variety of activities being undertaken by a wide range of public bodies across Scotland in support of the language and it is important that we capitalise upon this to move the agenda forward.  \u0026ldquoI am pleased that agreement has been made on these key commitments and I hope that we can all work together to develop further commitments in the coming months."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-cap-on-scottish-university-places-to-be-lifted","story":"  Richard Leonard, the party\u0026rsquos leader, said the move would ensure sufficient places were available to all qualified students as universities seek to attract more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Because university students in Scotland get free tuition the cap acts as a control on public spending.  There is no cap in England, but students pay fees of up to \u0026pound9,000 a year and leave university with significantly more debt.  Universities are currently facing targets to increase the number of students from the poorest backgrounds, but this inevitably means a squeeze on middle class pupils unless the cap is lifted.  Mr Leonard commended Edinburgh University for its use of the clearing system to widen access.  But he added: \u0026ldquoNow Scotland\u0026rsquos universities need support from the Scottish Government around the cap.  \u0026ldquoLabour would make the richest pay their fair share through tax to ensure that education is open to all, and that there are fewer barriers to university access.  A Scottish Government spokesman highlighted figures published earlier this week which show the number of Scots winning a place at university is at a record high.  The number of number of students attending university from the poorest backgrounds has also increased.  The spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis is testament to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos commitment to maintaining free university education for students from all backgrounds.  Scotland\u0026rsquos EU students and university staff also make a significant contribution to our economy, culture and society, and will remain an integral and valued part of our universities.  As in previous years Scottish universities such as Edinburgh and Glasgow now use the clearing system to attract students from the poorest postcodes.  The move has been welcomed in some quarters, but Lindsay Paterson, professor of education at Edinburgh University, said the postcode system could, perversely, open the door to middle class students.  He said: \u0026ldquoDisadvantaged young people not in an eligible postcode would be missed and the policy would enable many young people who are not deprived to use clearing."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4033618.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-switch-off-campaign-goes-viral-but-is-the-publicly-funded-broadcaster-really-biased","story":"  Allegations of biased journalism within the publicly funded broadcaster have been historically made on both the left and right of the political spectrum.  But on Thursday a new social media campaign fuelled by a body of Scottish nationalists to boycott the BBC went viral, prompting a fresh discussion over whether the state broadcaster is biased.  The #BBCSwitchOff campaign is being supported by those who believe that the broadcaster is biased.  A fresh wave of protests began at 6pm on Thursday when it was suggested people switch off the BBC.  It was the number one trended hashtag on Twitter on Thursday across the UK with BBCBias also in the top ten. It was a similar story in Glasgow and Edinburgh.    One of the reasons for the campaign was the belief in some quarters that Jeremy Corbyn and left-of-centre politics is not getting a fair hearing on the Beeb.  Many Corbyn supporters were up in arms over an image of the Labour leader on Newsnight in March which they felt had been altered to look \u0026lsquomore Russian\u0026rsquo.    It came hot on the heels of Labour moving to defend Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s comments claiming the BBC is biased towards \u0027Israel\u0027s right to exist\u0027.  The Labour leader made the comments to Iranian state TV channel Press TV in 2011, when he was a backbencher.  On Thursday it appeared the BBC changed a headline on its story about Wednesday night\u0026rsquos attacks on Israel after the Board of Deputies angrily complained about its \u0026ldquoappalling stance on the issue.    The BBC\u0026rsquos original headline was \u0026ldquoIsraeli air strikes \u0026lsquokill woman and toddler\u0026rsquo, with no mention of the rocket attacks which came before the strikes.  On Thursday morning, the Board of Deputies tweeted: \u0026ldquoAppalling @BBCNews headline after Israel responded to *150* rockets fired at its towns by terrorists while families were asleep. We have complained and you should too, including a link to the BBC complaints page.      I truly thought the #BBCswitchoff was a Scottish thing....nice to see the rest of the UK has awoken to what we\u0027ve put up with for years....and nobody believed us back then.....      Will BBC report that #BBCswitchoff is trending at number one? We\u0027ll never know. #BBCswitchoff  The BBC subsequently changed its headline to \u0026ldquoGaza airstrikes \u0026lsquokill woman and child\u0026rsquo after rockets hit Israel.  The Board subsequently said this headline was \"better... but it\u0026rsquos still an inversion\".  \"Israel\u0026rsquos cities were struck by 150 rockets, sending tens of thousands in to shelters. Surely the headline should reflect this, it said.    A BBC spokesperson said: \"\u0026ldquoAlthough the original headline was not factually incorrect, we updated it to add more context to the story.  The Twitter\u0026nbspcampaign has been adopted by people outwith Labour activists, including a body of Scottish independence supporters.  Famously hundreds of Yes supporters held a demonstration outside BBC Scotland\u0027s headquarters over alleged bias in the network\u0027s coverage of the independence referendum in September, 2014.    And last week, the BBC moved to deny political bias after a pro-independence blogger criticised the public broadcaster after his YouTube channel was shut down in a copyright row.      wow not only is #BBCswitchoff number 1` now . its also the most tweeted in the last 4 hours and the 13th in the psast 24 hours . Well done guys keep it up.      Amused by #BBCswitchoff hashtag. We in Scotland have been mocked for complaining about warped @BBC reporting for years. #misreportingScotland @BBCScotlandNews  Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland channel, claimed his channel was closed without warning after the publicly funded BBC complained about 13 videos that had been uploaded to it.  The channel of another prominent independence campaigner, Peter Curran, was also shut down after BBC copyright complaints.  Meanwhile it was demonstrated that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.    The BBC halted its action while it reviewed its copyright enforcement responses and the channel was reinstated.  It was reinstated by YouTube while the BBC said it will review its actions.  While the organisation is required to provide impartial coverage, 40 per cent of people feel this isn\u0026rsquot the case \u0026ndash according to a poll in May by BMG Research.  BMG asked 1,005 British adults if they consider the BBC to be politically neutral, and just 37 per cent of them said they did.  But nobody can quite make up their mind why.      So here we go....people who are tired of #bbcbias get a chance to join the #BBCswitchoff tonight at 6pm starting with the @bbcnews. Judging by listening figures people have already turned off Humphrys @sarahsands100 \u0026amp @BBCr4today. We need a fair \u0026amp neutral national broadcaster. https://t.co/4L2g9hROOW      #BBCSwitchOff    Fed up with the way they normalise the racist and intolerant attitudes of those on the right and victimise and smear those on the left.    Always giving Tories the top jobs. No balance at all. They dont even try to hide it anymore.#BBCBias pic.twitter/qYzJYtVSNA  A combined 22 per cent of respondents felt it was either somewhat or strongly biased towards left-wing views, while 18 per cent felt it was somewhat or strongly biased towards the right. Nearly a quarter of people said they just didn\u0026rsquot know.    Last week the BBC withdrew an educational film about immigration following complaints that it was biased.  The film, aimed at GCSE pupils, contained claims that Britain was \u0027multicultural long before curry and carnival\u0027 and that debate over immigration had fuelled a \u0027huge rise\u0027 in support for far-Right politics.  It was pulled from circulation and removed from YouTube after complaints that it broke impartiality rules.  Last week it emerged BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos flagship news and current affairs programme, Today, which for decades has set the agenda for the media-political elite, has been haemorrhaging listeners.    According to figures released by RAJAR, the official body for the monitoring of radio audiences, the programme has lost more than 800,000 listeners over the past year.      #BBCswitchoff The difference between the Boris coverage and the Corbyn coverage is a classic illustration of #bbcbias      Fight back against #BBCBias from 6 pm this evening :    1 Switch off the BBC at 6.    2.Join the Twitter storm about BBC Tory Propoganda bias    3.Always use the hashtag #BBCSwitchOff it\u0027s case sensitive. little people can change things too it\u0027s#BBCSwitchOff pic.twitter/aDz0ZZscgr  The BBC noted that audiences for news and current affairs programmes fluctuate over time, and suggested a \u0026ldquoquieter news agenda partly explained the drop-off.  But Tom Mills, a lecturer in sociology at Aston University and the author of The BBC: Myth of a Public Service says it may be because \"liberals and leftists have finally given up on the programme\".  Accusations of a left-wing bias were often made against the BBC by members of Margaret Thatcher\u0027s 1980s Conservative government.    Norman Tebbit called the BBC the Stateless Person\u0027s Broadcasting Corporation because of what he regarded as its unpatriotic and neutral coverage of the Falklands War, and Conservative MP Peter Bruinvels called it the Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation.  Nine years ago, BBC director general, Greg Dyke, criticised the BBC as part of a \"Westminster conspiracy\" to maintain the British political system.  Nigel Farage has previously attacked the organisation for being too left-wing, and Leave voters accused Question Time of deliberately picking \u0026lsquoless intelligent Leavers\u0026rsquo for a TV audience last year.      Dear @BBCNews please explain to me how Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos outrageous and racist rhetoric is just \u0026ldquosilly language but despite Corbyn\u0026rsquos lifelong fight against racism, you are happy to basically compare him to Hitler? #BBCBias #boycott https://t.co/4pxY6Opexe  The BBC last month defended its Brexit coverage after being accused the corporation of \"journalistic cowardice\" in its reporting of the EU Referendum and its aftermath.  In response, James Stephenson, news editor at BBC News, said it had \u0026ldquoreported on every aspect of the [Brexit] story over the past two years.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere can be few times in the BBC\u0026rsquos history when its journalism has mattered more. This is not an organisation frightened of journalism, but committed to it.  BBC\u0027s Europe editor last year hit out at claims the broadcaster is biased against Brexit - claiming they have been blocked from holding European officials to the same standard they hold British officials to.    Speaking to BBC\u0027s News Watch programme, which monitors complaints about the broadcaster, Katja Adler, the BBC\u0027s Europe editor, addressed claims of spreading \"doom and gloom\".  Ms Adler, who is based in Brussels, said she understands viewers who see this perceived bias and complain the BBC unfairly portrays the British side of the talks.  She explained: \"It is a fair comment to make.  \"It is my job to put across the European perspective, which may come across anti-Brexit.  \"But this is all because, since the Brexit talks started, there has been silence enforced inside the EU Commission and among EU leaders, in order to only let Michel Barnier speak about Brexit.  \"We do not have the same access to talk to the same players as we do on the British side to put the difficult questions to them.  \"That can be very frustrating for our viewers, and it can seem like we are not doing our job, but the players just do not let us interview them on the record, so they end up being sources or insiders.\"  She said this led to the EU officials not being held to the same level of scrutiny as those in Britain, but insisted reporters in Brussels were trying their best to hold them to account.  The BBC were approached for comment on the Twitter campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists-reveal-how-blue-light-from-smartphones-accelerates-blindness","story":"  Research by the University of Toledo in the US has revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light triggers poisonous molecules to be generated in the eye\u0026rsquos light-sensitive cells that can cause macular degeneration \u0026ndash an incurable condition that affects the middle part of vision.  Blue light, which has a shorter wavelength and more energy compared to other colours, can gradually cause damage to the eyes.  Dr Ajith Karunarathne, an assistant professor in the university\u0026rsquos Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, said: \u0026ldquoWe are being exposed to blue light continuously and the eye\u0026rsquos cornea and lens cannot block or reflect it.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no secret that blue light harms our vision by damaging the eye\u0026rsquos retina.  \u0026ldquoOur experiments explain how this happens, and we hope this leads to therapies that slow macular degeneration, such as a new kind of eye drop.  Macular degeneration, which affects around 2.4% of the adult population in the UK, is a common condition among those in their 50s and 60s that results in significant vision loss.  It is caused by the death of photoreceptor, ie light-sensitive cells in the retina.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the US and while it does not cause total blindness, AMD can make everyday activities such as reading and recognising faces difficult.  Photoreceptor cells need molecules called retinal to sense light and trigger signalling to the brain, enabling us to see.  The researchers found that being exposed to blue light causes retinal to set a chain of reactions that leads to toxic chemical molecules to be created in the photoreceptor cells.  Kasun Ratnayake, a PhD student at the University of Toledo who was involved in the study, said: \u0026ldquoIf you shine blue light on retinal, the retinal kills photoreceptor cells as the signalling molecule on the membrane dissolves.  \u0026ldquoPhotoreceptor cells do not regenerate in the eye. When they\u0026rsquore dead, they\u0026rsquore dead for good.  The researchers found that introducing retinal molecules to other cell types in the body, such as cancer cells, heart cells and neurons, caused them to die off when exposed to blue light.  They also noticed that blue light alone or retinal without blue light had no effect on cell.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThe retinal-generated toxicity by blue light is universal. It can kill any cell type.  The scientists found that a molecule called alpha tocopherol, a natural antioxidant found in the eye and body, stops the cells from dying but fails to offer any protection to the ageing population or those whose immune systems have been suppressed.  Dr Karunarathne said: \u0026ldquoThat is when the real damage occurs.  For those wanting to protect their eyes from blue light, Dr Karunarathne advises wearing sunglasses that can filter both UV and blue light outside and avoiding browsing on mobile phones or tablets in the dark.  The research is published in the journal Scientific Reports."},{"url":null,"title":"almost-half-of-scots-one-year-olds-have-been-on-a-flight-airline-reveals","story":"  Figures from Emirates found 48% of one-year-olds in Scotland have travelled by plane.

The Open Streets programme would see key parts of the city centre closed to traffic on the first Sunday of every month from 10am to 5pm.  Based on similar, successful schemes in Paris and New York, the report says it would \"help citizens experience the city in a quieter, more people-focused environment\".  Engagement with residents, businesses, and emergency services would be required to determine which streets to close and ensure suitable diversions are in place, it states.  Transport convener, Councillor Lesley Macinnes, said: \"Frankly, the status quo is just not an option any more.  \"As a council we are serious about tackling poor air quality, reducing congestion and making it as easy as possible to get around Edinburgh, especially by walking, cycling and public transport.\"  The consultation follows workshops held earlier this year with transport providers, private sector companies, community councils and school pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"house-of-fraser-from-humble-beginnings-to-high-streets-across-the-uk","story":"  But like so many before it - including Woolworths, Toys R Us and, most recently, Poundworld - it has fallen victim to the rise in discount stores and the shift in consumer habits from physical purchase to online shopping.  The future once looked so bright. A series of marquee acquisitions over a 50-year period in the middle of the 20th century saw the company\u0027s portfolio blossom, offering customers an everything-under-one-roof shopping experience that allowed people to browse for wedding gifts, homeware, beauty products and designer clothes, all within the same four walls.  It was a far cry from its humble beginnings as a small drapery shop in Glasgow in 1849, the brainchild of farmer\u0027s son Hugh Fraser and small business owner James Arthur.  The name Arthur \u0026amp Fraser was born, and could be found on the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street in the Scottish city.  A century later, and after the wholesale business splintered from the retail side, the firm had grown to become a national chain known as House of Fraser.  It would go on to acquire numerous other businesses as its stores emerged bruised and bloodied but emboldened from the Second World War, from clothes broker Brown Muff \u0026amp Co in Yorkshire to Dingles drapery shop in Plymouth.  Harrods, too, would become part of the House of Fraser family in the late 1950s. Then, in 1985, the company was bought by Egyptian-born tycoon Mohamed Al Fayed and its profile soared further.  But trouble was afoot.  By January 1997, new chief executive John Coleman delivered on his promise to sell three stores - with the loss of 1,000 jobs - having been hit by a slump in the womenswear market and \"poor buying policies\".  A slight increase in sales the following year was not enough to drag the company into the black, and House of Fraser would go on to mortgage some retail estates to raise money for store revamps.  A further rise in like-for-like sales at the turn of the millennium gave cause for optimism, new store openings and the creation of hundreds of new jobs.  It would go on to acquire more regional chains, such as Jenners and Beatties, but the company\u0027s wheels had started to come off by the time it was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower Group for nearly \u0026pound500 million in 2014.  The rise of discount stores such as Primark and Poundland, and the growth of internet shopping through sites such as Amazon, had already been credited as a contributory factor for hastening the demise of several high street staples.  Finally, after signalling that its future looked bleak, House of Fraser announced on Friday that it had fallen into administration, endangering the future of 17,000 staff.  As of June, the group had 59 locations across the UK and Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-duncan-smith-says-employers-have-not-bothered-to-look-at-british-workers","story":"  Speaking on Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme, the former work and pensions secretary blamed employers for not hiring British workers and dismissed business chiefs\u0026rsquo call for immigration targets to be scrapped after Brexit.  Instead, he said a system of work permits should be extended to all foreign workers wanting to come to the UK.  \u0026ldquoA lot of employers simply have not even bothered to try and find UK people to work, he said.  \u0026ldquoI think the best thing to do is work with what we have got and make it work for everyone around the world, he said. \u0026ldquoYou basically extend the work permit process across the EU and the rest of the world.  \u0026ldquoPeople can come here for work but they need to have work to come to and that work needs to have been agreed and accepted that there isn\u0026rsquot a person in the UK that could do that work and has the skills to do that work.  Mr Duncan Smith, the founder of the troubled universal credit benefits scheme currently being rolled out, went on to claim the current welfare system was distorting the employment market.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos happened is access to benefits, including child benefits even if you don\u0026rsquot have your children with you, has distorted the whole system around them being able to offer much cheaper wages and have them completely topped up.  \u0026ldquoIn the last year figures were available, and this is important, more than \u0026pound4.1 billion was spent on people from the EU who have come over here getting tax credits, child benefits, housing benefits. That\u0026rsquos one of the great pull factors.  \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.  \u0026ldquoWe need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.  But the CBI, representing business leaders across the UK, has called for politicians to recognise the value of immigration to the UK economy, which they said should include scrapping immigration targets after Brexit.  Businesses need a new immigration policy, avoiding visas for EU citizens and putting migration on the table for trade talks, according to the CBI\u0026rsquos new report\u0026nbspOpen And Controlled \u0026ndash A New Approach To Migration.  Evidence from\u0026nbsp129,000 firms across 18 industry sectors in the report showed the importance of migration at all skill levels, said CBI deputy director-general\u0026nbspJosh Hardie.  He called for \u0026ldquoblunt targets to be axed to enable companies to hire the staff they need.  \u0026ldquoThis is no longer a theoretical debate, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about the future of our nation. Openness and control must not be presented as opposites.  \u0026ldquoScrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration dividend to support public services will add to public confidence.  \u0026ldquoMany sectors are already facing shortages, from nurses to software engineers \u0026ndash so fast, sustainable, evidence-based action is needed.  The report highlights how businesses do not just need \u0026ldquothe brightest and best immigrants, but different skill levels across many different sectors.  Mr Hardie outlined the contribution made by EU immigrants to building Britain\u0026rsquos houses \u0026ndash from labourers and electricians to architects \u0026ndash and in food and drink, starting with farm workers, through logistics and into hospitality.  \u0026ldquoThe stakes couldn\u0026rsquot be higher, he said. \u0026ldquoGet it wrong, and the UK risks having too few people to run the NHS, pick fruit or deliver products to stores around the country.  \u0026ldquoThis would hurt us all \u0026ndash from the money in our pockets to our access to public services.  \u0026ldquoThe needs are more complex than only ensuring that the UK can attract the \u0026lsquobrightest and best\u0026rsquo.  He also called for greater migration to be part of future trade negotiations to allow the UK economy to grow, as well as reform of the non-EU immigration system of visas.  \u0026ldquoFor Global Britain to succeed, the UK must send the right signals that show it remains open and welcoming to the world, he said.  \u0026ldquoThat means putting migration on the table in trade talks to get us a better deal, first with the EU and then other countries, where it is clear existing visa restrictions inhibit trade and foreign direct investment.  Black Country MP John Spellar, an occasional Labour Brexiteer rebel, criticised the CBI for \u0026ldquosticking plaster remedies for a failure to train British workers.  \u0026ldquoBleating Bosses should do more training of youngsters and workers in the UK rather than relying on bringing in workers from the EU, he said.  \u0026ldquoAs an example they cite nurses, yet the Tory Government and useless NHS Bureaucrats cut training numbers, denying thousands of hopeful youngsters of the chance of a fulfilling career.  \u0026ldquoRecruiting from abroad has been a sticking plaster over their failure in this and many other sectors, and it\u0026rsquos time to call a halt.  Businesses need to win public support for an open immigration policy, said immigration think tank British Future\u0026rsquos director Sunder Katwala, calling for \u0026ldquobigger changes.  \u0026ldquoOur post-Brexit immigration system will need to win public support and restore confidence in how we manage immigration, he said.  \u0026ldquoPeople do see the gains for the economy of skilled and student migration \u0026ndash but people are worried about the scale of migration in lower-skilled work.  \u0026ldquoThe public sees the referendum as a reset moment \u0026ndash so they are expecting bigger changes than the CBI is proposing."},{"url":null,"title":"north-korea-asks-us-to-ease-sanctions","story":"  The call comes as the rival Koreas plan to hold high-level talks on Monday to prepare for a third summit between their leaders and as Washington and Pyongyang try to follow through on nuclear disarmament vows made at a US-North Korea summit.  In the most recent sign of growing frustration between Washington and Pyongyang, North Korea criticised senior American officials for insisting that North Korea give up its nuclear weapons first before easing sanctions.  Notably, the statement did not directly criticise President Donald Trump, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June.  North Korea said in a statement on Thursday that \u0026ldquosome high-level officials within the US administration were making \u0026ldquodesperate attempts at intensifying the international sanctions and pressure.  \u0026ldquoWe hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust between Pyongyang and Washington, the North\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.  \u0026ldquoHowever, the US responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure.  Those American officials are \u0026ldquogoing against the intention of President Trump to advance the DPRK-US relations, who is expressing gratitude to our goodwill measures for implementing the DPRK-US joint statement, it said referring to the North by its official name, the Democratic People\u0026rsquos Republic of Korea.  Washington has said that sanctions will not be lifted until Pyongyang fully and finally dismantles its nuclear weapons.  Some experts say that North Korea does not want to denuclearise first or maybe denuclearise at all because it wants a long, drawn-out process that sees external aid shipped in in return for abandoning nuclear weapons.  Pyongyang has also stepped up its calls for a formal end to the Korean War, which some analysts believe is meant to be the first step in the North\u0026rsquos effort to eventually see all 28,500 US troops leave the Korean Peninsula.  A South Korean official at the Unification Ministry said the two Koreas will also discuss on Monday ways to push through tension-reducing agreements made during an earlier summit between Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  Among the agreements was holding another inter-Korean summit in the fall in Pyongyang.  The rival Koreas may try to seek a breakthrough amid what experts see as little progress on nuclear disarmaments between Pyongyang and Washington despite the Singapore summit in June and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u0026rsquos several visits to North Korea.  Pyongyang insisted that the US should reciprocate to the North\u0026rsquos suspension of missile launches and nuclear tests and other goodwill gestures such as the return of remains of American troops killed in the Korean War.  The United States cancelled a joint war exercise with South Korea that was due to take place this month while dismissing calls to ease sanctions until the North delivers on its commitments to fully denuclearise.  The inter-Korean meeting on Monday will be held at Tongilgak, a North Korean-controlled building in the border village of Panmunjom.  South Korea\u0026rsquos unification minister will lead the delegation from Seoul but North Korea, which proposed the Monday meeting first, did not confirm the makeup of its delegation.  It was not clear when another inter-Korean summit might happen, but if the April 27 summit agreements between Mr Moon and Mr Kim are followed through on, the leaders will likely meet in Pyongyang in the next couple of months.  In the meantime, both Koreas are seeking an end of the Korean War.  South Korea\u0026rsquos presidential spokesman said last month that Seoul wants a declaration of the end of the 1950-53 war sooner than later.  The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the fighting ended with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.  Earlier on Thursday, North Korea\u0026rsquos Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that ending the Korean War is \u0026ldquothe first process for ensuring peace and security not only in the Korean peninsula but also in the region and the world.  Mr Kim and Mr Moon met in April at a highly publicised summit that saw the leaders hold hands and walk together across the border, and then again in a more informal summit in May, just weeks before Mr Kim met Mr Trump in Singapore."},{"url":null,"title":"chess-prodigy-allowed-to-stay-in-uk-thanks-to-world-class-talent","story":"  Shreyas Royal and his parents were told they would have to leave when their visa expires next month.

Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response.

In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.

He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 10 Aug 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county...

They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Friday 10 Aug 2018 6:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 10, 2018 at 3:58 pmAt a loss for what to do this weekend?

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 6:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 6:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I have been to a college fresher\u0026rsquos fair on Skye. They invite us each year and we have a stall, which is great.\"The people that we meet have no problems at all.

The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Friday 10 Aug 2018 6:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct will attempt to keep as many House of Fraser stores open as possible following a £90 million rescue of the ailing retailer.            The tracksuit tycoon struck a deal to buy the firm out of administration earlier on Friday, raising hopes for the future of thousands of staff.            In a stock market announcement, Sports Direct said it has acquired all 59 House of Fraser stores, the brand and all of the retailer’s stock.Some 17,000 staff have been informed that they will be transferred over from House of Fraser to Sports Direct.However, doubt remains over the long-term future of jobs and whether Mr Ashley will shut underperforming stores as part of a restructuring programme.The billionaire, who also owns Newcastle United, said that Sports Direct will “do our best to keep as many stores open as possible”.In the same breath, he said: “My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into the Harrods of the high street.”            Mr Ashley’s deal was struck through a pre-pack administration process, where a company is put into administration before a new buyer cherry-picks the best assets.• READ MORE: Mike Ashley’s Sport Direct strikes deal to buy House of Fraser for £90MThe tycoon beat off competition from retail rival Philip Day, the billionaire owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill.It is understood that Mr Day’s proposal was in excess of £100 million, would have avoided an administration and included House of Fraser’s pension scheme.            However, accountancy giant EY, which was overseeing the process, opted for Mr Ashley’s offer.The Sports Direct chief added: “This is a massive step forward and further enhances our strategy of elevation across the group.“This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector.“It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands. Our deal was conservative, consistent and simple.”Sources said that Mr Ashley will now begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under the Flannels fascia.            Prior to its collapse, Mr Ashley had held an 11 per cent  stake in the department store chain.The deal will see the tycoon tighten his grip over the British high street, adding to his sports retailing and “premium fashion” empire.The billionaire has also built up stakes in rivals such as Debenhams, Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection.House of Fraser was plunged into crisis last week after C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, pulled its investment in the troubled retail chain.C.banner was planning to buy a 51 per cent  stake in House of Fraser and plough £70 million into the ailing retailer, but then scrapped the move.Prior to the latest crisis, House of Fraser had recently agreed a so-called Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with landlords to close half of stores, with 6,000 jobs in the firing line.• READ MORE: House of Fraser falls into administrationIt is unclear what the status of the CVA is following the takeover.Like other retailers, House of Fraser has been stung by soaring costs and falling consumer spending power.The company saw its business rates bills rise £3.99 million to £30.24 million this year following a Government revaluation, according to research group Altus.Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, said: “This is a hugely ambitious move for Sports Direct. The combination of both businesses will yield some vital cost-saving synergies while it’s likely that some of the struggling House of Fraser sites will be rebranded to Sports Direct.“Nevertheless, this is a part of the industry that is under a huge amount of pressure. Turning around the business will not come easy. The stores are failing to attract sustainable levels of footfall while battling against rising operating costs and shifts in shopper behaviour.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776018.1533894026!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike ashley s sport direct strikes deal to buy house of fraser for 90m","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Andrew McCornick, the director of NFU Scotland, added his voice to the growing chorus of concern that the UK will leave the EU without a trade deal, with catastrophic effects on our supplies of food.            “A two-minute delay at the UK border to complete customs checks could result in a 17-mile tailback – so warned the Port of Dover authority recently,” he wrote. “For the agricultural industry, which relies strongly on ‘just in time’ processes in order to trade in fresh produce, this is a deep concern with the rhetoric around a ‘no deal’ Brexit continuing to build. As Scotland’s largest agricultural organisation representing more than 9,000 farmers, crofters and growers, NFU Scotland has always been clear: ‘no deal’ would be the worst-case scenario and tantamount to the kind of chaotic cliff-edge change that we are desperately trying to avoid.”            READ MORE: Andrew McCornick: No-deal Brexit threatens fragile food supply linesJoyce McMillan said the visa problems that have been affecting international authors coming to take part in the Edinburgh International Book Festival were a sign of Theresa May’s “hostile environment” towards visitors to this country, a policy that had created a “painful downward spiral into the kind of xenophobia that is bound to harm us far more than those we seek to exclude”.“The truth is that the whole British visa system is now based on the assumption that most applicants are confidence tricksters trying to sneak into the country in order to take up permanent residence and people who may be traveling for very different reasons – for work or cultural exchange or urgent medical treatment, to visit a dying relative or attend a family celebration – can only take so much of being treated in that aggressive and hostile manner, and essentially addressed as if they were criminals,” she argued.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: Festival visa problems show perils of ‘hostile’ UKChris McCall wrote a moving piece about the Edinburgh International Book Festival. While he urged people to go along to this year’s event, he said he could not bear to do so himself.            “This year I will be missing all this for perhaps only the second time in my adult life. My dad, a resolute supporter of the event from its inception, died suddenly in February. The festival was our father-and-son outing, a tradition we continued even after I left the capital for Glasgow,” he said.“Authors can now rest easy. They won’t be button-holed by my dad any longer. While I mourn his loss, I know he would agree with me on this point: in the age of Trump and social media blowhards, any forum for respectful debate must be supported.”READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpJohn Swinney, the Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister, defended Scotland’s education system, pointing out that “the overall pass rate remains high at 77.4 per cent” and that the number of awards of skills-based qualifications had increased to over 50,300 this year, “more than double the number in 2012”.             “That reinforces to me, yet again, that we have fantastic young people led by dedicated teachers and lecturers delivering first-class education in our schools and colleges every day. And that is backed by a robust, credible assessment system,” he wrote.READ MORE: John Swinney: The evidence shows Scottish education is first classHowever, Lesley Riddoch slammed ministers over the decision to make primary one children sit tests.“The Scottish Government’s new national tests in literacy and numeracy took a pummelling last week with the publication of teachers’ concerns. Some said the test had prompted otherwise confident five-year-olds to burst into tears and one child had ‘soiled itself due to the extreme distress’. Children said things like ‘I’m no good’, ‘I can’t do this’, and ‘Why are you making me do this?’ Others were ‘shaking and crying’. One teacher branded the tests ‘completely useless’ and ‘cruel nonsense,’ saying pupils could get high scores simply by guessing answers,” she wrote.\u2028“The urge to stuff education into five-year-old brains may be understandable but it’s not rational, helpful or kind.”READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Testing five-year-olds is not child’s play            Ayesha Hazarika took Boris Johnson to task over his decision to describe women who wear burkas as looking like “letter boxes” or “bank robbers”.“Johnson is shamefully using Muslim women as a pawn in the wider toxic, nasty, racist political climate.

It would be more honest because the consumption is already there but is driven underground to the benefit of organised crime,” he argued. “The police could focus on more serious crime and by taking cannabis out of the hands of criminal dealers and regulating it, it would actually be easier to control its ­supply to ­children than currently. There is concern that cannabis consumption causes mental health problems but that surely misses the point. If consumption is already significant (and it is) and it does have an impact on mental health (and it probably does) then surely it is better to bring it out into the open and allow its supply to be regulated and those with problems to be treated?”READ MORE: Brian Monteith: A vaping tax is stupid, cannabos is where the money isKenny MacAskill urged people not to forget the struggle to prevent dangerous climate change from occurring and to accept that significant changes would have to be made to our way of life.“Many years ago, I recall speaking to an influential US Republican acquaintance who’s view of global warming was akin to that of the markets on society. There’d be winners and losers according to him, doubtless imagining warmer summers in parts like Scotland and simply regretting the catastrophe that might happen elsewhere. But, wealth and power cannot insulate you as death and destruction don’t discriminate on those criteria. Floods in Texas and fires in California have shown that wealthy parts suffer and rich folk die, even if greater efforts are made than were after Hurricane Katrina for the poor black communities of New Orleans,” he said.“We need to change and change fast. That means governments must take decisions that are hard and probably unpopular but cannot be shirked.”READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Climate Change’s threat to humanity is crystal clearDarren McGarvey, writing bravely about his own experiences, warned about the effect pornography was having on relations between men and women. “Increasingly, porn is used to get around intimacy and straight to gratification making the natural ebb and flow of sexual intercourse seem slow, clumsy and cumbersome. Not only does repeated porn use rewire your sexual preferences, but physically you become a different animal constantly setting yourself up for a fall because, on one hand, you desire sex, but it must conform to a certain, often very specific, expectation or it won’t excite you. Then there is the more humiliating factor that often you cannot physically rise to challenge of your own veracious sexual appetite,” he said.READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Porn moulded me into a sexually selfish manAnd finally, Jim Duffy found himself in the battle of his life trying to put together some Ikea furniture, but there was a happy ending to his tale.“As I get to about page 10, my lack of dexterity and mobility, my lack of mental agility and focus, and my lack of understanding of spacial awareness and how to follow simple instructions really kick in.

His comments follow a series of pro-independence events across Scotland including an annual march in Glasgow earlier this year which saw a record number of supporters take to the streets.            Many want to see the First Minister press ahead with a second referendum on leaving the UK when she provides an update on her position in the autumn.            However, Mr MacAskill called for supporters to be patient, warning that a lack of clarity over Brexit and the unlikelihood of permission being granted by UK ministers mean another vote will not be immediate.Nicola Sturgeon has previously urged SNP members to concentrate on winning the case for leaving the UK rather than the timing of any ballot.Writing in The Herald newspaper, Mr MacAskill said caution from the First Minister was wise, but he added that “real leadership” was needed to gain support for her position.Read more: SNP MSP calls in police after vile letter is sent to constituency office“Just because you’re marching doesn’t mean that you’re any closer to a referendum, let alone to winning it,” he said.            “And that’s where Nicola Sturgeon needs to show real leadership.”The former MSP added: “She’s waiting for the chance and will take it when it comes.“There needs to be less marching and more engagement on the doorsteps listening to people, not telling them what you want them to think.“So far, the party has been remiss in campaigning and providing direction, which is why others have filled the void with marches and other activities.            “Leadership needs to be shown shown with party HQ building the organisation from the base up not being seen as the First Minister’s fan club.”An SNP spokesman said: “The base of support for independence has never been as consistently high as it is now - and we agree with Kenny MacAskill about the need to work hard to persuade even more people across the country of the benefits of an independent Scotland.“Support for independence is likely to rise further as the reality of the Theresa May’s shambolic Brexit plans becomes clearer and in the face of an arrogant Tory government which thinks it can do whatever it wants to Scotland and get away with it.”Read more: SNP MSP quits Twitter after ‘attacks’ from Old Firm fans"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782186.1533914581!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp calls on uk government to scrap nonsensical net migration targets","story":"        The SNP has called on the UK Government to scrap its \u0026#8220nonsensical\u0026#8221 net migration targets, echoing recommendations in a report published by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).                The party’s Westminster immigration spokesman, Stuart McDonald MP, said the findings showed there was a desire amongst the business community for reform of the UK’s non-EU immigration system so that firms could better access people and skills from around the world and not just the EU.            The report - Open and Controlled: A New Approach to Migration - took evidence from 129,000 firms across 18 industry sector.            It concluded the UK Government should “build public trust in the UK’s migration system by shifting away from controlling numbers.”Mr McDonald said: “The SNP has consistently called for an end to the Prime Minister’s hostile environment policy, and for a shift to an evidence-based immigration policy which supports our economy in a challenging post-Brexit environment.“The SNP position is that there must be a root-and-branch review of immigration policy and that review should be based on facts - not on the ideological interests of the Tory party. “The UK Government has repeatedly promised an immigration white paper - and an immigration bill - over the past year, yet it has shamefully failed to deliver, with only a matter of months left before the UK leaves the EU.”READ MORE: Will Scotland’s population shrink without its own migration system?            The MP for Glasgow South continued: “The Scottish Government has set out the case for Scotland to have the power to tailor its own immigration policy to reflect its unique demographic needs.“It’s high time the UK Government ended its narrow-minded approach, and instead worked with the devolved governments in order to protect our economy, the business community and hundreds of thousands of jobs.”The UK Government’s Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) is due to publish its final report on the impact of Brexit on migration to Briain next month.Its interim report, published in March, focused on migration from the European Economic Area (EEA). The report’s authors suggested Scotland did not have more need of migrants to stem population decline than Wales or the north-east of England.            “Office for National Statistics projections suggest that if EU net migration was zero, the population in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would stop growing and even fall in the next 20 years,” it noted.“Though the population of England would continue to grow, some northern regions of England have similar projections to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 10 Aug 2018 6:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

We will not have another opportunity to source the majority of the funding that is now in place.\"\nMrs Birnie said that donations would only be drawn down if the target is reached and payment would not be required for a further month.\nThe covered court will be twice the size of a tennis court with the polymeric surface and players and other users protected by a stretched canopy. Tomatin already has a similar venue which has proved popular.\nTo donate, or get more details, contact Mrs Birnie by email at info@ybirnie or by calling 07711318016 or phone Joan Knox on 07597 904810.\nFriday 10 Aug 2018 6:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

He and her mammy met Ahed upon herrelease.\nTherewere joyful scenes. I was delighted. It was a good start to a Sunday.\nRonnieKasrils words and Ahed’s spirit and commitment made me think of Fian JohnDempsey who was killed on active service aged sixteen years old, around now 37years ago during the Hunger Strikes.\nEverygeneration in struggle throws up inspirational young people like Ahed.\nTheyhelp keep older activists grounded they challenge complacency push backboundaries they are, rightly impatient for change.\nI hadjust turned 16 when the 1981 hunger strikes occurred.\nBackthen I thought the hunger strikers seemed much older. In fact, they were onaverage only nine years older than me.\nTheintensity of political struggle distorts the significance of age difference.Ten to 15 years between comrades can sometimes seem like an age.\nI saidthis recently to Jim Gibney as we talked about Ronnie Kasrils’ visit.\nRonniewill be 80 years-old this November. He has spent all of his life as a politicalactivist.\nBut helooks, and interacts socially, like someone much younger.\nBeforehe came to Ireland he inquired about the current ages of my own children.\nI jokedthat as they were getting older I was getting younger!\nHereplied that of course I’d be getting younger, because ‘The struggle keeps usall alert and in fine fettle.\nI firstbecame aware of Ronnie Kasrils in 1992 when the march on Bisho occurred duringthe phase of mass action in South Africa.\nHe wasinterviewed on international news as one of the key leaders and was veryarticulate.\nTheSouth African national liberation struggle was at a decisive period.

They reciprocated with standing ovations.\nIn theGasyard centre in Derry’s Bogside he raised the roof with a funny story ofmeeting Ché Guevara in Dar-es-Salaam where he said therevolutionary icon gave a speech on armed struggle in Africa which was “bollocks”!!!\nWe helda very dignified wreath laying ceremony at Martin McGuinness’ grave, duringwhich Ronnie spoke very emotionally of Martin’s legacy, before giving amilitary salute as one freedom fighter to another.\n\nIn aseparate moment towards the end of his stay he said to me warmly: “You’ve gotthe right strategy you’ve got the right politics.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"call for intervention in limavady to ease tensions after sectarian incidents","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It is also disappointing that the PSNI, who were on the scene, took no measures to stop them and that is something I raised with the police in today’s meeting,\" Ms Archibald said.\n\n“As we face into the weekend, particularly with the Apprentice Boys parade taking place, there is a responsibility on all political, civic and community leaders to do all they can to help reduce the tensions that exist.\n\n“The community in Limavady are growing increasingly concerned at the damage that is being done to community relations so I would again appeal to all those in positions of influence to stand together in combating this negative agenda.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

Previously, Gerry Adams has called the report \u0027common sense\u0027,\" the Strangford MLA said.\n\n\"Behind some of the claims that \u0027everyone’s a winner\u0027 in this united-Ireland however there lies a reliance on supposition and wishful thinking to build a case.\n\n\"Looking at just some of the issues included in the report’s ‘Ten Point Plan’ sheds some light on the strength of the case put forward.\n\n\"The report assumes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report has claimed Northern Ireland could be financially better off in a united Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued UK government subvention to Northern Ireland for approximately thirty years.\n\nAn immediate £10billion contribution to infrastructure by the UK government.\n\nThe UK government will continue to fund pension costs.\"\n\nMr Hamilton said that reunification would cost thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"Interestingly, the report does not dwell too long on its view that 50,000 public sector workers in Northern Ireland would have to be made redundant. However even in this area it expects the United Kingdom Exchequer to bear all the costs,\" he said.\n\n\"All these highlight the lack of substance behind many of those who claim a united-Ireland is some kind of inevitability. We cannot be complacent however and must continue putting forward a positive case for the Union.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland chippies take carryouts to new heights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173767.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/E%20310718KB4%20%200003.jpg","title":"pride 2018

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"navy families reunited after sevenmonth deployment","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Shreyas is a phenomenal talent who can represent the UK on a global stage for years to come.” \n"},{"url":null,"title":"alan shearer leads mike ashley jokes as newcastle owner buys house of fraser","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

And I’m sorry.”\n\nAlthough the lawsuits were settled out of court, Affleck’s name in 2016 and 2017 became associated with a long list of men who have abused power in Hollywood.\n\nWhile Affleck has addressed the lawsuits, he also has not spoken publicly since #MeToo and Time’s Up overtook the culture 10 months ago.\n\n\n\nWomen have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that time, Affleck also opted out of presenting the best actress award at the Oscars — traditionally the responsibility of the previous year’s best actor winner. Instead, Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence handed the trophy to Frances McDormand.\n\n“I think it was the right thing to do just given everything that was going on in our culture at the moment,” Affleck said. “And having two incredible women go present the best actress award felt like the right thing.”\n\nAffleck said he has been learning a lot in the past few years listening to the conversation and has moved away from a place of defensiveness to one of finding his own culpability.\n\n“I think bigger picture, in this business women have been underrepresented and underpaid and objectified and diminished and humiliated and belittled in a bazillion ways and just generally had a mountain of grief thrown at them forever.\n\n“And no one was really making too much of a fuss about it, myself included, until a few women with the kind of courage and wisdom to stand up and say, ‘You know what? Enough is enough’.\n\n“Those are the people who are kind of leading this conversation and should be leading the conversation. And I know just enough to know that in general I need to keep my mouth shut and listen and try to figure out what’s going on and be a supporter and a follower in the little, teeny tiny ways that I can.”\n\n\n\nI want to be in a world where grown men model compassion and decency and also contrition when it\u0027s called for\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nOf his decision to do an interview now, Affleck said: “If I’m not promoting a movie, I’m not going to do any press, so that’s why you haven’t heard from me.”\n\nHe is also taking these lessons both to work and home to his two sons, who are aged 14 and 10.\n\n“I want to be in a world where grown men model compassion and decency and also contrition when it’s called for, and I certainly tell (my sons) to own their mistakes when they make them,” he said.\n\nAt his production company, Sea Change Media, he said he and his development partner Whitaker Lader are looking to shepherd filmmakers with stories that are not well-represented in Hollywood.\n\n“It’s nice to be able to take the teeny tiny bit of experience that she and I have and use it to help other people get started,” Affleck said. “There’s really no better feeling than that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured us baseball streaker from northern ireland reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome confirmation firmus energy extend gas network culmore area derry","story":"\nSDLP Cllr Angela Dobbins has welcomed the news that Firmus Energy have plans to extend a network of pipes transporting gas energy further into the Culmore area.\n\nCllr Dobbins said: “I have been liasing with Firmus for a number of years now and I am delighted that the group have now received the green light to extend the gas mainpipe further into the Culmore area. \n\n\"Works have already commenced to feed off from the mains into the adjoining areas and I have been informed that O Donovan Rd, Colby Ave, Thornhill Pk and Templard have now become piped and live feeds with more to follow.
