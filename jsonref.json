At least one of the singer\u0027s attorneys says he urged her repeatedly over the years to draft one.\u0027I tried to convince her that she should do not just a will but a trust while she was still alive,\u0027 says Don Wilson, a Los Angeles lawyer who worked on entertainment matters for Franklin for nearly 30 years. \u0027She never told me, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do one.\u0027 She understood the need. It just didn\u0027t seem to be something she got around to.\u0027Laura Zwicker, an attorney who specializes in estate planning but is not affiliated with the Franklin estate, says she sees it happen all too often in her work.\u0027People don\u0027t like to face their own mortality,\u0027 Zwicker says. \u0027I had a client who had a $70 million real estate portfolio who had had end-stage diabetes. He had plenty of conversations with me about estate planning but would not sign the documents.\u0027  She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin (pictured), Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardianPapers filed in Michigan\u0027s Oakland County court last week by David J. Bennett, the lawyer who worked most closely with Franklin, lay out the few known basics:She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin, Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardian. And a niece of hers has accepted the role of executor.  Family members embrace at Franklin\u0027s funeral. A niece of hers has accepted the role of executor Under Michigan law, as in most states, the sons will equally ide their mother\u0027s assets in the absence of a will, and so far no signs of conflict have emerged among family members. Bennett did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.Aretha Franklin\u0027s friend Ron Moten, a Michigan businessman, gave the four sons some guidance in his speech at Friday\u0027s funeral.\u0027Remember your family, and friends that have been with you for years,\u0027 Moten told the men. \u0027Because you are about to meet a lot of people who will now want to be your new best friend. You will also meet some people that will have the best investments in the world for you. My advice? Go slow, be careful and be smart.\u0027The documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estate. The figure almost certainly runs into the tens of millions, but there will probably be widely varying estimates as her attorneys seek to downplay her wealth for tax purposes and the IRS tries to maximize the amount for its own reasons.Franklin maintained ownership of the songs she wrote and did well by them, Wilson says, though of her major hits, \u0027Think\u0027 is the only one that\u0027s her own composition. She also wrote some lesser hits, such as \u0027Rock Steady.\u0027  Jordan Franklin, left, pauses alongside his sister Victorie Franklin while speaking about their grandmother, Aretha Franklin. Documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estateThough her records were played millions of times, she earned little in radio royalties from smashes like 1967\u0027s \u0027Respect\u0027 because such payments go overwhelmingly to the song\u0027s author, not the performer. In the case of \u0027Respect,\u0027 the royalties go to the estate of Otis Redding, even though the song owes nearly all its popularity to Franklin.\u0027I would imagine she probably felt she was entitled to more, but probably received more than a lot of artists from the time, especially African-American artists,\u0027 Wilson says.Among Franklin\u0027s more tangible assets are several pieces of property in the Detroit area that according to tax assessors\u0027 estimates are worth at least $2 million, with a market value that could easily be twice that.Star of Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage apologizes after appearing to...Bill Clinton is VERY impressed with mini-dress wearing...Share this article    Some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent   \u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 lawyer Laura Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent\u0027Once the value is established - a process that could take years - the IRS will take any back taxes Franklin owed, then will tax her estate at 40 percent for any assets beyond $11.2 million.Kenneth Abdo, an attorney who specializes in probate law and has worked on the estate of Prince, who also died without a will, says the IRS will conduct an audit of her holdings.Wilson, her entertainment attorney, says she would not have wanted to see her finances publicly aired: \u0027She was a private person.\u0027As for why some clients don\u0027t make out a will, Zwicker said some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent.\u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/31/19/4F9234F700000578-0-image-m-15_1535741463543.jpg","title":"Paul McCartney talks psychedelic experience interview","story":"Paul McCartney in 1968, who today revealed he took psychedelic drugs and \u0027saw god\u0027While the band\u0027s music was heavily influenced by psychedelic drugs in their final years. Paul McCartney was widely considered the \u0027good\u0027 Beatle, who took less drugs than his bandmates, John, George and Ringo.But in a wide-ranging interview today, the Liverpudlian said he was \u0027immediately nailed to the sofa\u0027 after taking a drug called DMT (dimethryptamine) that became popular in the late 1960s due to having similar but faster acting affects than drugs like LSD and magic mushrooms.McCartney says he was with a small group of people when he took the drug,  which opened him up to the idea of an after life.Paul McCartney\u0027s new album is brimming with passion (and...Share this articleHe also tells the paper of a time he saw a white squirrel and concluded it was his late wife, Linda McCartney, a photographer and animal rights activist that died in 1998 of breast cancer. The 76-year-old added: \u0027Obviously, I have no proof it was her at all, but it was good for me to think that\u0027.It\u0027s not the first time McCartney, who is about to release his 17th solo studio album, has spoken openly about losing loved ones.

I don’t ask my cover stars to do a blood analysis. \u0027What else is dangerous is we have a crisis about mental health and body image. It is one cover in a world that has venerated thinness.          Piers Morgan was involved in a fiery debate with the glossy mag\u0027s editor Farrah Stoor (pictured), who defended the cover for promoting a positive body image.          Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027\u0027I’ve see her run around with her children, she works 14 to 15 hours a day.\u0027Mr Morgan claimed the magazine was \u0027doing it for click baits and get Cosmo talked about\u0027, before adding: \u0027You are celebrating morbid obesity\u0027.Mrs Stoor replied: \u0027Am I saying that this is OK to look like? Yes I am. The reason she is on my cover is to show that there is a different way to look.\u0027We live in a culture that venerates being thin. Someone will see and think I’m going to feel good about looking like this.\u0027Mr Morgan pointed out that throughout the interview, conducted by Mrs Stoor, she did not mention at any point the health issues surrounding obesity.When Mrs Stoor responded by saying \u0027we don\u0027t pass judgement\u0027, Mr Morgan said: \u0027You do pass judgement, Cosmo do that literally on every page.    During the debate, Shameless and Brookside star Tina Malone (right), who lost 12 stone and 4 pounds, revealed she started missing out on work due to her weight loss\u0027She is representing to them an image that isn’t right. You should be encouraged to come out and be healthy and lose weight. \u0027You would not put someone on the front cover with drugs and vodka. She is killing herself.

We\u0027re not all right. It\u0027s a lot of change that needs to occur. This change must come from within us. Nobody can give us things to eliminate where we are. We have to change from within ourselves. \u0027It is ludicrous for the church not to be involved. The church is the only viable institution we have in the African-American community. We must step up and turn our race around.\u0027Williams maintains that a turnaround of black-on-black crime would be the ultimate tribute to the Queen of Soul who sang about black female empowerment way ahead of the time it became trendy in mainstream music.\u0027I think if she\u0027s immortalized, she should be immortalized,\u0027 he said. \u0027If we can turn black America around, it would be the greatest and best immortalization we could properly give to her for what she did for black America and the world when she lived.\u0027  Williams hasn\u0027t backtracked at all, he seemed to feel more sorry for how people chose to react rather than the content of his words.He responded: \u0027I understand it.

It will continue to be brilliant.\u0027He revealed that he has been speaking to his \u0027nearest and dearest\u0027 about his decision.He said: \u0027It\u0027s been quite big news in our house over the last few weeks and months. I\u0027m going to leave.

From left to right, Zoe Ball, Sara Cox and Jo Wiley, are among the favorites to step into Chris Evans\u0027 shoes as the new host of the Radio 2 breakfast showBy Emily Kent SmithSara Cox has been tipped as the favourite to replace Evans on the Breakfast Show.Odds for Cox, 43, were slashed to 2-to-1 yesterday.The former \u0027ladette\u0027, who has reinvented herself in recent years and is regarded as a top talent at the BBC, received widespread backing on social media.Fuelling rumours further, she posted on Twitter: \u0027Shucks. You lot, honestly. Whatever happens, today on Twitter has felt like one massive hug. Thank you.\u0027Cox joined the BBC in 1999 and currently has her own 10pm to midnight programme during the week.If picked, she would be the first woman to host the flagship morning programme full-time since the station launched in 1967.Contrary to the posh Oxbridge image that some associate with the Corporation, Bolton-born Cox left school with four A-levels for a career in modelling and moved into TV aged 19 after being spotted by scouts.But her career has not been without its controversies.On Radio 1\u0027s Breakfast Show, she told of how she had lost her virginity in a field at the age of 15, and was once sent home from a modelling shoot drunk. Cox has since admitted she\u0027s come a long way since the wild days of her youth, telling the Mail: \u0027Ladette is a word that makes my toes curl now.\u0027A married mother-of-three, she has already covered for Evans on occasion.And following the gender pay crisis that has engulfed the BBC, many believe the coveted position should go to a woman.Several other female stars are in the mix with odds of 6-to-1 on Jo Whiley and Zoe Ball. Claudia Winkleman is the outsider at 12-to-1. Drivetime presenter Simon Mayo is the top man tipped for the job with odds of 4-to-1.

Travelling alone can also cost more as deals are aimed at those who are holidaying together And those unable to split the cost of a cabin on a Med cruise face paying double at more than £2,000.The study suggests even in death singles are punished, with the cost of getting a joint will drawn up working out at £259, or £129.50 per head, compared to £169 for one person.Good Housekeeping also found an example of a couple paying £167.26 – £83.68 per head – for home insurance compared to £173.78 for a single.Car insurance on a per-head basis for a couple was £905 versus £1,102 for a single person.Good Housekeeping’s consumer affairs director Caroline Bloor called on companies to ditch the ‘singles tax’, saying they needed to wake up to the needs of this growing market.She added: ‘While there’s less stigma around being single in today’s society, clearly we are still being penalised financially.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Mac eyesight tests stopped drivers","story":"    \u0027Look out for the police, Marjorie love.

They were once part of a migrating community of reindeer herders but today, in their old age, they spend most of their days in the village of Yar-Sale, cut off from their nomadic relatives and friends.Though the men are encouraged to stay within the wandering community as they grow older, the women often find themselves facing the struggles of ageing in isolation.Life in the village might seem more comfortable than life as a migrating elder in the wild tundra, but it comes at the cost of great loneliness and a loss of purpose. In the past, each woman held an essential role in her community. Pudani, for example, was a leading herder, while Liliya was the only person in her tribe who knew how to read. Over many cups of tea, these women shared their life stories. They told me about magical snowy landscapes, lost parents and partners.  I asked each woman for permission to take their portrait in the natural light of their homes and wearing a precious item from their past. Using their stories as a guide, I also documented the wild landscapes they once wandered.Autipana Audi (born 1941). During her lifetime, Autipana experienced many sad losses. She lost her husband, son and daughter to diseases, and a few years ago her entire reindeer herd perished to starvation during a cold wave. Almost unable to walk, she spends her days mostly limited to her bed. Autipana, who was born in the tundra, says that “walking in the snow” is what she longs for most.Necla Audi (born 1928). Although Necla was 89 when this portrait was taken, she still wishes to live with the migrating community. “I was born in the tundra and spent all my life there, it’s the only way of living I know.” At the far left of her bed is a picture of her two sons taken when they were young. Now, both of them are herders in the tundra.Angelina Serotetto (born 1942). Angelina was part of a family of shaman women and her mother taught her to read the future using sacred objects from nature. “Yes! I miss those days in the past,” she says. “But I try to remain optimistic. I view everything with a loving eye. I think you learn it as you get older”. Vaynoto Vera (born 1967). Having living in nature throughout her entire life, Vaynoto’s daughters rented her a small apartment in the village of Yar-Sale so that she could live in comfort. They come to visit her whenever possible but as they are obliged to return to their herds and migrating journeys, Vaynoto is often left alone.Zinaida Evay (born 1946) and her cat Persik (“peach” in Russian). Zinaida was married for many years, and she shared with me that she had a beautiful and loving bond with her husband, right to his last day. Now that he has passed away she is living in a small apartment alone, with their mutual cats, with almost no friends to come and visit. “All that is left are the lullabies I sing to myself.” Liliya Yamkina (born 1944). As a child she was the only one in her clan who knew how to read. She said she still remembers how important she felt when she read everyone their letters and formal documents. However, the importance of her reading skills to the clan was also the reason that her father prevented her from going to college and that caused many conflicts between them. Now, in her apartment, she writes love songs about the Tundra and her dream is to publish them in a magazine. “I did not fully understand the importance of tradition and family when I was young. I argued so much with my parents. I wanted to escape from my roots.” But, she adds: “I remember how much I liked it when they told me folk tales around the bonfire. I miss them so much.”Pudani Audi (born 1948). Like her ancestors who have wandered the frozen landscape of northern Siberia for thousands of years, Pudani was born in the tundra and roamed since birth. During her adulthood, she was a leading herder, leading the precious herd through one of the most extreme environments on earth. She told me that she is still hoping to return to wander, but without her community’s support it is clear that this longing will never be realised. In this portrait, she is wearing a fur hat, the sole object she was left with from her wandering days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501cc10bcb9f05a5aa4f31178ea69ebdc3543055/0_147_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=3250\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16610376ad7cce3fb3fa3a05393ac171 3250w","title":"adventures in street photography in pictures","story":"Funny, tragic and often bizarre, Stephen Leslie’s photos in his book Sparks are an unique ode to street photography, matching short fictions with the images that inspired them.• An exhibition of selected prints will be on display at theprintspace gallery in London until 5 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5dd1fa840afad260ca9780e11b343997b170256/0_226_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51deb574ff1b909b231b1d6ddad47452","title":"trikala greece first smart city dont need to know a politician to get something done","story":"Trikala, in Greece’s agricultural heartland, is an unlikely candidate for a leading smart city – but innovations have improved lives despite the financial crisis“In the past, residents had to call the vice mayor just to change a broken street lamp,” says Sonia Sofou, a police officer turned civil servant. “Now you don’t need to know a politician to get something done.”The 37-year-old is hard at work in the control room of Trikala, Greece’s first smart city. On the wall, nine screens display colourful maps and graphs monitoring the availability of parking spaces, the status of traffic lights and water pipes, the location of rubbish trucks and the town hall’s monthly budget.Sofou answers the phone, logging reports of uncollected rubbish and fallen tree branches into the small city’s e-complaint system. As she works, the information shows up on one of the screens above her.Smart cities – usually defined as those that use technology to improve services, increase transparency and become more efficient – are proliferating around the world. Pioneered in Europe, they can now be found everywhere from India to Korea. With more than two-thirds of the world’s population expected to live in cities by 2050, finding ways to make cities work better for the people who live in them has become a priority. Major companies such as Intel, Cisco Systems and IBM are involved in researching new applications in this growing field.Set among green fields in the agricultural heartland of Greece, the historic city of Trikala – population 82,000 – was not an obvious candidate for the nation’s first smart city.The country was in the grips of a financial crisis and the municipality was €45m (£40m) in debt when Dimitris Papastergiou became mayor in 2014. There was zero budget for his grand, tech-savvy plans.But through collaborations with partners including the European commission, which funded a driverless bus pilot, and companies such as Greece’s Sieben and Parkguru, Trikala has earned a reputation for innovation that dates back to 2004 when Greece’s Ministry of Economics named it the nation’s first digital city. It was later shortlisted as one of the top 21 smart cities in the world. By participating in EU-funded projects and offering up a test site for local tech companies, the city has cut its debt by €20m.Trikala is also the only place in Greece to have supplied Lego and Raspberry Pi robotics kits to all its 120 public schools, a move paid for by e-Trikala, a company created in 2008 to fund local innovation that is majority-owned by the municipality.Over in the echoing corridors of the 7th High School of Trikala, ICT teacher Vassilios Spachos shows off his robotics lab – the first of its size in a Greek public school when it opened in 2015 with a grant from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and support from the municipality. Standing around tables of hand-built creations that can escape mazes, climb stairs and analyse water quality, he explains why such opportunities are so important for Trikala’s youth.Tech aside, Trikala was also the first city to actually enforce the 2008 national smoking ban in all enclosed public spaces by working with local business owners and using social media to extoll the benefits of ditching cigarettes – although local bars and restaurants initially grumbled about the crackdown.There were also complaints about the removal of 80 parking spaces to make room for driverless bus lanes, especially when the municipality converted them to permanent bike paths after the pilot ended. Papastergiou recalls being accused by one city council opponent of making life difficult for people with cars, something he takes as a compliment.Unsurprisingly, some among the older generation scorn the hi-tech initiatives as pointless. “There are a few who think, we don’t need that,” says 79-year-old retiree George Kiriakoulis, who took a ride on the driverless bus once out of curiosity. “But mostly my friends are positive on these new things.”This shift in attitudes is one of Trikala’s biggest achievements, says Pantoleon Skayannis, a professor specialising in innovation at the University of Thessaly’s department of planning and regional development.It “might not be Nasa technology”, he says, “but they create an environment in which citizens are gradually immersed and get used to IT.”The city has big plans for the future. Trikala wants to join the EU’s Activage programme, which tests smart houses that monitor elderly residents’ health by detecting movement and food consumption. Trikala also wants to further develop a farming project which uses technology to grow ancient medicinal plants for the pharmaceutical industry.For ICT teacher Spachos, creating smarter cities is the key to tackling this problem. “Tech is the only sector that gives young people the tools to succeed in life nowadays, just look at the wealthy people in the world,” he says, shaking his head.“If our country could follow the example of this municipality, maybe we could get out of this crisis.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be3a238cad5730fca6fec9a7485e615cbd14b37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6733b3dfed62565ab89d45fdab3f602b","title":"britain shared spaces pubs youth clubs libraries austerity","story":"Austerity and technology have combined to close pubs, youth clubs and libraries up and down the countryIn our towns, villages and suburbs, they are now such a common sight as to be mundane: boarded-up pubs, awaiting conversion to some new use or forlornly falling into dereliction. The\u0026nbspcurrent rate of closure is put at 18 a week. In rural areas, shuttered hostelries represent something particularly tragic: with churches reduced to silent visitor attractions and shops\u0026nbsplong since gone, they embody the demise of precious local assets in places where maintaining community life is an ongoing struggle.Blame for the demise of pubs tends to focus on the 2007 smoking ban, impossible business rates and beer duty, the ocean of cheap alcohol sold by the big supermarkets, and younger people’s dwindling interest in booze and its associated rituals. Even if it ignores the ways in which many pubs have changed, the enduring idea that they are essentially male environments must also be part of any explanation. But there is also a clear sense of something every bit as fundamental: the decline of shared spaces, and the way we seem to be\u0026nbspsplintering into ever-smaller social niches. Many local\u0026nbspbusinesses and institutions that depend on attracting a wide range of people are fading away. Worse still, the local and national politicians who might\u0026nbspintervene often seem either not to care or to be\u0026nbspmaking\u0026nbspa bad situation even worse.If our era has a pre-eminent gathering space, in both its chain and independent forms, it is\u0026nbspsurely the modern cafe – where most people seem to\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbsphunched over their laptops, transfixed by their phones, or huddled with friends and oblivious to everyone else. This is the opposite of the places where the best kind of chaotic, unexpected experiences can happen and you might end up falling into conversations with complete strangers.As well as the stripping-back of some of the most essential public services, one of the key effects of 10\u0026nbspyears of austerity has been the crushing of countless other shared spaces: drop-in centres, libraries, Sure Starts. Perhaps the most overlooked casualties have been the hundreds of youth centres and clubs that have closed since 2010. More than 600 such facilities in Britain have shut over the last six years, with the loss of 139,000 youth places and 3,650 staff. In our major cities, anxiety about this organised neglect is focused on gangs and knife crime. In quieter parts of the country people’s worries are more\u0026nbspbasic – as in Gywnedd, north Wales, where recent plans to close all 39 of the county’s youth clubs were greeted with the unanswerable argument that “young people will have nowhere but the streets to socialise with each other in the evenings”.In the Cheshire suburb where I grew up, I depended on such places, which offered the same social mixture as our local comprehensive school only without maths, history and geography getting in the way. Bands were formed relationships came and went naifs like me learned vital life-skills such as how to play pool properly and the correct use of swear words. Naturally enough, there were fights, acts of vandalism, illicit drunkenness and more, but the saint-like youth workers – at the club I\u0026nbspwent to most often, they were from the local Methodist church – knew what they were doing was important, and bravely persevered. This was where I found out not just who I was, but that people were often completely unlike\u0026nbspwhatever outward stereotype they presented.On one hand cuts on the other, deep cultural changes that are pushing us even further apart. Among some middle-class people there has long been a cringe about anything that smacks of cultural universalism, but this prejudice now seems to be defining an ever-greater swath of our culture. Most obviously, the 20th-century model of egalitarian consumerism (summed up by what Andy Warhol said about America’s greatest export: “A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking”) is now something to be sneered at rather than aspired to, not least when it comes to the places where we eat and drink. From Wetherspoons to McDonald’s, places that emphasise affordability and an appeal that runs across income groups and generations are viewed more snobbishly than ever. Better, it seems, to be an habitué of a bespoke cafe bar with the correct selection of craft beer, halloumi and chips for the kids. The\u0026nbspdownside of hipster culture, perhaps, is that it combines its love of quality with elitism and exclusion.All this affects the most basic facet of how we interact with others: our mating rituals. If these things used to at least partly happen in the random cacophony of the pub and club, the new world is surely symbolised by internet dating. In many ways, this is a good thing. It has been massively liberating for the LGBTQ community, and research suggests it also increases the likelihood of people pairing beyond their own ethnic group. But there are also downsides, typified by the kind of dating sites whose proposition is so sniffy as to be almost self-parodic (witness Ivory Towers, an online service that claims to have ensured “thousands of postgrads from Oxbridge and beyond have found love, friendship and marriage”). It is not hard to see where this kind of social filtering leads. As a recent article in the Economist put it: “Assortative mating, the process whereby people with similar education levels and incomes pair up, already shoulders some of the blame for income inequality. Online dating may make the effect more pronounced: education levels are displayed prominently on dating profiles in a way they would never be offline.”This much we know: with social mobility having stalled and deep class and regional inequalities intensifying a sense of a country hopelessly ided, we need to think not just about the economic forces that have pushed everything in that direction, but the way the same separation plays out every\u0026nbspminute of our ordinary lives. In the Britain of 2018, one question for the kind of people who have probably never set foot in their local boozer has become a cliche: do you know anyone who voted leave? Soon enough, it may be superseded by an even more alarming one: do you know anyone who isn’t exactly like you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe4fdb5c2853f03c71dae282bb8c37e22d70ef2d/0_85_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09193577240fc832c106a5ca2bd75b81","title":"genocide rohingya international community myanmar rwanda","story":"The time for talk is over. The international community has to act, or it could fail in Myanmar just as it failed in RwandaA UN report has accused the Myanmar military of genocide. The report is being taken, by some at least, as a call to action, with the UK’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, immediately promising to visit the country “to seek answers at the earliest opportunity”.The UN passed the genocide convention, which defines genocide in legal terms, in December 1948. It sets out genocide as a series of actions – ranging from killing to imposing measures to prevent births – committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.The question of whether what has been happening to the Rohingya in Myanmar can be defined as genocide is not a new one. It started well before the forced expulsions of a year ago. In fact, the accusation of genocide being perpetrated in Myanmar – against various groups – has been raised repeatedly over the last two decades. It is essential that today the attempt to define whether genocide has been perpetrated does not continue to serve as a distraction to addressing the situation itself.In 2005, a report by Guy Horton labelled the violent military actions against Karen people in Myanmar as genocide. His approach was to take the definition of the crime of genocide and break it down into component parts. He then identified specific acts on the ground that could be compared with each part, and argued that, when put together, the case of genocide was made.It was a form of inverse logic. Horton believed that inidual incidents – however disparate geographically and over time – when considered as a piece provided a sufficient basis to argue the overall intent of the elimination of a people, which underpins the definition of the crime of genocide.This approach generated much discussion. There were some who thought the methodology too mechanistic, and that it did not work in establishing the intent that is so important to the definition of genocide. Others thought the approach very credible. Which side various groups took was not unrelated to their own positioning: the categorisation of genocide was in part used to further demonise the regime committing the act – and to justify the application of crippling economic sanctions.Almost 10 years later, a case was once again made that genocide was being committed in Myanmar. In early 2016, Al-Jazeera produced a hard-hitting documentary in which the International Human Rights Clinic at Yale University used a similar deconstructionreconstruction methodology to argue acts of genocide against the Rohingya. And while international bodies debated whether to call it such, crimes against humanity and war crimes continued to be perpetrated. No tangible action was taken, and more than two-thirds of the population were forced to flee to Bangladesh.In the wake of the second world war, genocide has become the pinnacle of absolute crimes, and has surpassed, in terms of gravity, war crimes and crimes against humanity. But is this right? This debate is ongoing – but such discussions must not detract from the fact that all three must be condemned and addressed with equal determination and force. Debating which category atrocities fall into without taking any action just anaesthetises the international community to the need to address any of them.True, in the case of genocide, the commitment was made by the UN general assembly for immediate action 70 years ago. But how relevant was such a bold resolution, when in practice it was disavowed in the course of the Rwanda genocide in 1994? More than 800,000 people were slaughtered in three months, while the international community – fearing the obligation to intervene – stood by and postponed the acknowledgement of the nature of the horrors until it no longer mattered.The terrible crimes against the Rohingya are clearly crimes against humanity, and possibly war crimes. I fear that pursuing the debate about whether or not they constitute genocide for too long could become a distraction that results in delaying further the building of collective international will to take necessary action. Defining an act as genocide involves legal substantiations that are often difficult to make or satisfy. All the more so in this case, where the United Nations Commission of Experts were never permitted to enter Myanmar. This fact alone may end up polarising members of the international community (none more so than those on the security council) and ultimately justifying inaction. One needs to look no further than the myriad international interests that have come into play in an attempt to resolve the Syrian conflict to appreciate the risk.We could possibly reach an answer to the question of whether genocide is being committed. But at what cost? Will naming it so then risk fracturing international commitment to act and undermine a more robust response? War crimes and crimes against humanity are sufficiently grave offences to justify international action. However we refer to them, immense crimes have been and are being committed in Myanmar. It is time for the world to stop debating how to categorise them and focus on finding the necessary resolve to act.• Charles Petrie is a former assistant secretary general of the UN, and was the UN deputy humanitarian coordinator in Rwanda during the 1994 genocide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7d624d0bfbb9442e49e8c8a5bf45ff863f5ab2/39_309_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14755dfa2373f349f9dc5de447c2134","title":"marooned ship brexiteers phoney claims","story":"I last visited the ship two years ago, already long marooned at its berth. Returning last week, Great Yarmouth had become a near-prison for its\u0026nbspIndian captain and crew, waiting for their back pay that never came. The Malaviya Twenty is a silent symbol of the sinking British shipping industry. Why was an Indian ship employed to ply to and from British ports, servicing the British oil industry and British wind farms? Because a foreign-registered ship could pay its crew a third of a British crew’s wages or less: despite government guidance, the UK minimum wage isn’t currently enforceable. With the oil industry downturn, the Malaviya’s owners stopped paying the crew and there the ship stayed, arrested by maritime authorities. But\u0026nbspsoon the crew will be free.Captain Rastogi and his last four crew finally won a high court case, helped by the Nautilus International union and the International Transport Workers’ Federation. The Admiralty marshal agreed that the ship could be sold to pay the port and the crew: the law says the private port gets first dibs, so the sale price matters to the crew. On the day I visited, prospective buyers were inspecting, ready for next week’s auction. The captain reckons it will raise enough to cover backpay of\u0026nbsp£180,000, after port charges.This isn’t a one-off: foreign companies have stranded other hapless unpaid crews: one ship was recently left in Sharpness with no food. Though working in British waters between British ports, foreign ships are cheaper and use foreign labour, with a disastrous effect on British sailors. The US requires all internal port-to-port ships to be US-built and crewed – and there is nothing to stop Britain demanding all such UK shipping is EU-flagged. Instead, Britain has lobbied against tighter EU rules, even though the shipping industry is a prime example of the damage done by an unfettered free market. Only a third of British-owned ships fly a British red ensign the rest use low-pay countries’ flags of convenience.There’s no chance that the UK will take back control of its shipping or rule its own waves after Brexit, either, since – as so often – Britain has been the strongest lobby in Europe against reform – while issuing most “certificates of equivalent competency” to foreign mariners.The romance of seafaring traditions on this sceptred isle was the leitmotif of Brexiteer nationalism. Our island story, they said, never truly belonged in Europe. Once free of Brussels, the nation of Sir Francis Drake will buccaneer across the seven seas, bringing home untold new traded wealth from new worlds.In the real world of pirates and buccaneers, Brexit has just caused Britain to lose the London anti-piracy headquarters of the EU naval force, handing over to Spain and the French port of Brest. That’s despite its success in combating Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa, with only one attack so far this year. The European commission says the UK must be treated as a non-EU country without the same access to EU security databases and military procurement programmes. So as our Major General Charlie Strickland hands over to Spain’s Vice-Admiral Antonio Martorelli Lacave, who exactly is\u0026nbsptaking\u0026nbspback control of what?And in yet another Brexit glancing blow, and more jobs lost, the EU is deregistering three UK shipyards for use as shipbreakers to recycle EU-registered ships.All these “technical” Brexit mishaps fall below the news radar, but once you lift the stone in any industry, myriad misfortunes appear. As all workforces are left dangling, seafarers too have no idea whether EU maritime health and safety standards will be upheld post-Brexit. Britain’s cavalier free-market attitude towards its shipping industry suggests more deregulation.Next time the offshore wind industry proclaims the good news that it is close to profit without subsidy, ask whose ships service those wind farms – and whether their crews are subject to UK laws and pay rates. Companies get away with counting offshore wind farms and oil rigs as outside British jurisdiction. But their profits shouldn’t come from undercutting UK crews with pay rates no British-based crew could live on. The unions talk of policymakers’ “sea-blindness” over Brexit.Captain Rastogi, son of an Indian navy commodore, has had to guard his ship to stop it being claimed as abandoned. Confined to Great Yarmouth wharf, he is taken aback by the town’s poverty. The other surprise, he says, is Britain’s lost sense of the sea and its once great\u0026nbspshipping industry.Brexiteers make cunning use of the emotional tug of our seafaring history, but the global freedoms they promise threaten to be merely for employers to take more control over pay and conditions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11063a43610b79806b1d85a791b9c8d4779d4df9/0_265_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e33f37680a64d61a18a83cef951d166","title":"thanks mamma mia cheesy pop culture is just the refuge we need","story":"From Mamma Mia to Queer Eye and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, it’s clear: joy is cool againLast month I went with my husband and father to watch Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, a gloriously silly paean to Swedish pop music, the Mediterranean (a postcard version of it, anyway) and the pleasure of watching famous people burst – without any evident embarrassment – into song and dance. Dad said he was in need of a pick-me-up, and exclaimed after the film: “It was a hoot!”He seemed to echo the thoughts of many critics, who wrote about Mamma Mia as if they were starved of fresh air and sunshine, and in desperate need of some light. “Here We Go Again is uncomplicated joy in complicated, despairing times,” wrote Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson. “It’s hot, it’s muggy and the news is an ever-widening gyre of flaming airborne chili-festival Porta Potties,” conceded NPR’s Glen Weldon, “so how about we forgo a review that seeks to advance any cool, objective argument on the relative cinematic worth of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.”In the last 10 years the developed world has been through a global recession, several particularly hostile and isive election cycles, Brexit, fake news, the #MeToo moment and far-right political parties gaining traction all over the world. Why wouldn’t I want to watch Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard writhe around the bow of a boat to “Dancing Queen”? I left the theatre with a serotonin high I haven’t felt watching a television show or movie in years. I barely remember the original Mamma Mia film but I don’t think I had the same reaction to it – the exhilaration of escape and enjoyment in weird and difficult times. Last week Peter Kavinsky became the Internet’s Boyfriend when we all watched Netflix’s To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, in which a teenage girl finds that love letters to her crushes have been made public. It’s sweet, affectionate and relaxing watching two young people fall into what seems like a healthy and loving relationship (imagine!). It’s a much better film than Mamma Mia, but the response to it is similarly effusive. And the message is plain: emotional catharsis is cool again. Escapism is cool again. Joy is cool again.“It’s brought about a softness in its audience that feels radical – a direct response both to a dangerous and inhospitable political climate,” Alanna Bennett wrote on Thursday for Buzzfeed. Sophia Benoit wrote in GQ that we’re all a little “horny for wholesome”.“Wholesome wasn’t always this appealing, so why now? Just look at the world around us,” she said.We might have liked these films if they came out 10 years ago but I don’t think the response to them would have been so enthusiastic if I had not spent the past few years watching the news every day with horror and revulsion. Lily James’ breathless cartwheeling through an orange grove might have come off as painfully corny if I had not been deep into the comments section of a Facebook news post hundreds of times over the last decade. Now it looks like something I’d like to be doing.I used to love Handmaid’s Tale and Mad Men and The Dark Knight. But dystopian fiction and cynical dramas feel less palatable as we veer increasingly close to the real thing. I’m less eager to see pop culture that exposes the worst of our society when it’s already made so plain before us in a never-ending feed of bad news, angry argument and hate speech.There’s nothing that signifies our need for predictable triumph more than the Rom-Com Renaissance, the return of the sweet and inevitable happy ending. We’re now so much more gleeful about films like Netflix’s Set It Up and Crazy Rich Asians.It’s not just Mamma Mia getting the “oh well, we all need a little joy” treatment. Take the reception to Netflix’s Queer Eye reboot. “2018 has the TV it needs,” declared the . “There’s something cathartic about its Purple America spirit, contrived and reductive as it can be,” wrote the New York Times. What a relief to cry, to connect and to wrap up the issues that ide us into an easily digestible 30-minute television show that we can binge watch on a Saturday.The New Yorker’s Robin Wright found “hope” in America’s Got Talent. So much for the days of Simon Cowell’s caustic takes. What’s en vogue now is Nailed It, Netflix’s warm-hearted show about baking disasters, the gentle cosiness of The Great British Baking Show and co-workers who love each other on Brooklyn 99. Even a rather negative review of Making It, Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman’s purposefully feel-good show about crafting, by the Washington Post’s Hank Steuver, said: “Children are in cages, thermometers are rising, ice caps are melting. We take mental and emotional refuge wherever we can find it, armed with glue guns.”It seems, in 2018, that we’re craving comfort pop culture like we crave comfort food.If you believe, like I do, that things we watch and enjoy are a reflection of who we are as a society – what we value and what is important – then what we we’re really valuing today is a little break from reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acc46a2a4f99230da3a8069bad7588dd0f23bd4e/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e67ee2d6e28fb80f09c6e9d566391568","title":"ways activists stay cheerful refugee women hope","story":"I work with refugee women, and know how hard it can be to stay optimistic. Even small positive steps should be celebrated“Leftwing people are always sad because they mind dreadfully about their causes, and the causes are always going so badly.” So said the Nancy Mitford heroine who fell in love with a communist, and there is an awful ring of truth to her words. That sadness has started to seem relentless lately. I won’t parse the reasons, since my readers will know them all too well. Suffice it to say that the headlines are constantly terrible, and the unreported detail often worse. Campaigns that start with energy keep getting dragged\u0026nbspdown into factions and splinters, mud-slinging and taunts. And sometimes personal tragedies align with political setbacks in a way that feels impossible to rise above. One of the most powerful influences in my political as well as my private life has been my mother, who first took me to a protest in 1967 at Aldermaston when I was three months old, and later introduced me to feminism. A\u0026nbspmonth after she died last year I went to a women’s march alone and stood there rain- and tear-streaked, feeling as if I’d lost my compass.Keeping hope alive is not, therefore, something that\u0026nbsphas felt easy recently. But it also feels essential. I spend my working life alongside refugee women, and being with marginalised women teaches me that stepping out of the political arena would be a terrifically privileged step to take. It isn’t possible to suggest to women who are fighting for their basic right to survive that they could just practise self-care, eat more chia seeds and\u0026nbspdo\u0026nbspmore\u0026nbspyoga.I’m not saying that political activism has to dominate your life. All well and good if that’s what you choose, but for me and probably for most, the tally of a life well spent will be skewed more to family and friends, love and laughter, than to demos and meetings. But stepping away from activism completely doesn’t feel OK, not when so many people are teetering on the brink of disaster. I don’t want to lose touch with the possibility of a better future, even if the change each of us can make is very limited right now. So, here are three things I’ve learned that help me to stay in touch with hope.The first is completely obvious but weirdly hard to do. Instead of being active online, be active in everyday life – it can be a tonic. As Gloria Steinem said, “Obviously, there are huge advantages to the web, but it is not the same as being together in a room … You cannot empathise with each other in the same way as when you\u0026nbspuse all five senses.”Sitting with people rather than their online avatars helps you to see what you can do together despite your differences. You learn to shift your point of view rather than entrench it you recognise the integrity of others’ motives. And then when things do get bitter or your campaign fails, there are people around you whose support you can count on.In the work I do with refugee women, we’ve set up a weekly centre where women can get support and build skills to advocate for change themselves. There are tons of similar initiatives throughout the country that provide different narratives from the dominant political themes. While we mustn’t mistake sticking-plaster solutions for real change, it’s heartening to see how people are getting together to show that another world is possible.I don’t mean that we should be complacent and give up as soon as a little milestone is achieved, but a bit of progress is something from which to take heart. It’s weird that the left can be so reluctant to celebrate our own wins, when our history\u0026nbspgives us so many reasons to hope. I can be a real bore about feminist history, banging on to\u0026nbspyounger women not to forget their foremothers, but\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspdo it for good reason – so that people can see how it\u0026nbspisn’t unrealistic, but totally in line with reality, to expect improvements in the current\u0026nbspsituation.After all, there is still progress happening here and now, despite the torrents of awfulness. There is the rise of awareness triggered by #MeToo that has been such a boost for the women’s movement. And even in the beleaguered refugee movement, persistent campaigning against detention in the UK has resulted in small policy reforms and some pilots for wider change. Not a revolution, not yet, but an increase\u0026nbspin humanity for some of the most vulnerable people in our\u0026nbspsociety, and something worth holding on\u0026nbspto as we try to move forwards.I’d love to hear more on why others are staying in the struggle: the practical steps people are taking or the solidarity they are building. Because unless we start to build more positive stories, the same headlines of despair will dominate our future as well as our present.• Natasha Walter is director of Women for Refugee Women and author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ec10f6153a54c1530dc1129be90cba78463b063/0_84_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb267221e3c69013c20c7c5b02120e31","title":"bring back work visas overseas graduates say uk universities","story":"International student numbers in UK ‘flatlining’ as it fails to compete against likes of US British universities have called on the government to reintroduce a visa that would allow overseas students to stay in the country to work for up to two years after graduation.They say it would give the UK a competitive edge over rival countries and help it maintain the 450,000 international students, 134,835 of them EU-born, who come to study in Britain every year.Universities UK, the sector’s umbrella body, said in a briefing to parliament on Tuesday: “The UK remains an extremely popular destination for international students, attracting more students from abroad except the much larger US. “However, the UK’s closest competitors, such as the USA, Australia, France and Germany, all continue to grow at a faster rate than the UK.”Launching proposals for a time-limited visa, Sir Steve Smith, the vice-chancellor of Exeter University and chairman of Universities UK’s international policy network, said the visa would be an important source of soft power in the post-Brexit era.He acknowledged the government’s long-held pledge to reduce net migration to the “tens of thousands”, but said reintroducing a special post-study visa would send a “hell of a signal” to the rest of the world that Britain was a welcoming country.“I think we are in danger of losing our position as one of the world leaders in international education,” he said. “The market is buoyant, but the UK is flatlining in terms of international students.“The UK as a country needs to make it clear that international students are absolutely welcome. I think now is the time, when we are 29 weeks from Brexit allegedly, to make a grand statement about welcoming in a new era where global talent can come to this country, study, work afterwards and thereby deal with the number-one issue with the economy, which is productivity, allowing those skilled workers enter the workforce.”In 2012, the UK abandoned the post-study visa that had allowed graduates to stay and work in the country for two years, as the then home secretary, Theresa May, led a crackdown on student overstayers.He pointed out that the US and Canada allow students to stay for three years after graduating, while Australia, often cited as a role model for immigration by Brexiters, allows them to stay for four.A government-commissioned report on the impact of Brexit on the labour market is due to be published in autumn by the migration advisory committee.Vivienne Stern, the director of Universities UK International, said: “This is explicitly not a route to settlement.”She recognised that the Home Office was unlikely to open the gates to immigration in the current environment, but said the organisation wanted to lodge the proposal “in case the opportunity opens up” for a post-study visa once the report is published.Universities want the post-study visa to be unrestricted allowing graduates to seek jobs without a sponsor with colleges monitoring graduates for compliance.A spokesman for the Home Office said it recognised the the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK  which was why they allowed students to stay if they got a graduate level job get an internship or apply to set up a business in the UK.Universities UK pointed out that this is restricted as students must find a job with a salary of at least £20,800 at an employer with a Tier 2 sponsor licence within four months of completing their course, or find sponsorship as an entrepreneur. PhD students are separately able to stay for up to 12 months following completion of their degree."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4667235f6a463d519451666241b5c006760a0b98/0_517_5280_3169/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f52c1795f91121490f68911feeba5fc","title":"stories 100 teachers coming to stage jess green burning books","story":"Her poem Dear Mr Gove got 300k views on YouTube. Now Jess Green has written a playKat is a bushy tailed newly qualified teacher raring to start imbuing the pupils of Hurstville Community College – the comprehensive on the estate to which the Teach First programme has assigned her – with her passion for English.But she can’t even get the youngsters to sit down in class, let alone enthuse them, and after only a week is thinking of packing it in.

The hundreds of emails she received from teachers confirmed Green’s view that their mental health and wellbeing were at risk from the unreasonable demands of the job.Green has never taught, but comes from a family of teachers, has worked in schools and has friends who are or have been teachers. Her mother retired last year after 40 years in teaching, 10 as a head of a comprehensive school. Her sister is a teacher progressing towards senior leadership, as is her brother-in-law.When Janine (played by Therese Collins) remembers her early days of teaching – two-hour lunch breaks she used for swimming shopping the pub with colleagues on Friday – Green is raiding her mother’s earliest professional memories.When Janine recalls what made her tear up her letter of resignation, written when she felt she couldn’t cope any more, Green is telling the story of one of the 100 teachers she interviewed before writing the play. The teacher had tutored a boy in GCSE maths during her lunch breaks. His mother was an addict who had thrown him out at the age of 12, and police found him five days later sleeping in a skip with his dog and addicted to sniffing glue. He went into care, but managed a grade C in GCSE maths. The teacher didn’t see him again until five years later, at a department store, where he was flourishing on a management training course. He said he couldn’t have done it without her: “No one ever told me I could do anything before you did.” Her resignation letter was binned.During Green’s early 20s she was a part-time school librarian in Leicester, and the conversations in the staffroom gave her a bleak view of what the profession was coping with. Later, when she delivered poetry workshops in schools across the country, she realised the problems were widespread – and the idea of an artistic piece was born.“The conversations were always the same. It was at the height of Michael Gove. The curriculum was so vast it was impossible to cover in a year. Teachers were having to send kids into exams when they hadn’t been able to cover all the material. And they were being constantly vilified, told that the job was cushy with long holidays and big pensions. If kids did well in exams, it was because the exams were too easy. If they did badly, the teachers were bad. Then they started to bring in unqualified teachers, including ex-military personnel for discipline. It was all suggesting that teaching was easy and that anybody could do it. It was undervaluing teachers. This made me very, very cross.”At the Edinburgh Fringe this year Green has been named the BBC’s Slam Champion after beating 30 other of the country’s top performance poets with her show A Self Help Guide to Being in Love With Jeremy Corbyn. To her delight, the man himself came to meet her when he was in Edinburgh.As for Burning Books, Green is glad her dark but often humorous play will give voice to some of the frustrations teachers face – and hopes those in power will listen. “I hope it adds to a very important conversation about teachers. About their mental health and welfare,” she says. “And about the need for an education system that fits all, not just a small number.”Touring from September to the end of November.

What should its priorities be? We asked Michael Wilshaw, Danny Dorling, Frank Cottrell-Boyce and othersBook review: A Clarion Call, by Melissa BennLabour has published its plans for a “cradle to grave” National Education Service and will unveil further details of its policy at its annual conference in Liverpool this month. It wants the NES to transform education into a right instead of a privilege, so everyone expects the same standard, as with healthcare in the National Health Service. But what would any incoming government need to do to create a truly national service? We ask people involved in education what their priorities would be.“I want to see radical change, not short-term, piecemeal measures and I am not sure I am seeing it in the policy at the moment. There should be a commitment to a broad and balanced, engaging curriculum with creativity at its heart, rather than at the margins. All children should be being taught critical learning skills, problem solving and political and social awareness, rather than getting a different curriculum depending on whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged. Reciting lists of kings and queens just doesn’t do it. I also want to see a reversal of the academy and free school programme and schools brought back into democratically accountable public sector management.”Diane Reay is emeritus professor of sociology of education at the University of Cambridge“Anyone drawing up an NES should take a long, hard look at the way the super-sizing of privilege has become a cancer on the body politic. Eton, for instance, seems to have done more damage to our national life than any single institution since the heyday of South Yorkshire police.“And end the whole craven notion that education should somehow be responsive to the demands of the world of work. No one has a clue what work will look like – or if there will be any – in 10 years, let alone 20.”Frank Cottrell Boyce is a screenwriter and novelist“The differential in performance between secondary schools in the north, Midlands and south of England is far too great and shows little sign of diminishing. This can’t be explained by economic factors, because there is very little difference in performance at primary school level.“The massive expansion of the academies and free schools programme has marginalised local authorities and the role of local politicians. I’m no fan of local authorities because many of them didn’t sufficiently support and challenge schools when they had full control of the system. My concern now is that local oversight of standards is just as patchy under the newly created regional schools commissioners, who seem to come and go with worrying frequency. We need local politicians, particularly the new mayors, to champion their schools and know what’s going on in their area.“This country is failing half its future. Technical and vocational education for those youngsters who don’t progress to traditional A-level courses and university has not been good enough for many years and certainly not up to the standard of many of our international competitors. These young people are too often served up inadequate programmes of study and training at school, further education institutions and apprenticeships. This is compounded by inconsistent careers education and guidance.“We urgently need a strong political figure at senior ministerial level to oversee the skills agenda and work across the departments of education, business and employment as well as the CBI and chambers of commerce to ensure key stakeholders work together.”Sir Michael Wilshaw is a former head of Ofsted and professor of education at St Mary’s University, Twickenham“Nursery education must not be run for profit. It may take five years to ensure nursery education in the UK is profit-free but it is entirely possible. All children should start school on their fifth birthday to get rid of the summer-born problem. Every school in those counties that have kept selection should be renamed “grammar schools” and the 11-plus should go.“Academy trusts must be disbanded after the fraud investigations are completed and school management returned to geographical areas. I would like to see groups of six or so neighbouring secondary schools with a single senior management team, democratically chosen. Teachers would be able to sack their senior managers. That’s how the governing body of an Oxford college works and it keeps them on their toes.”Danny Dorling is professor of human geography at the University of Oxford“The NES must ensure that students, whatever their background, are able to fully participate in education. This will mean examining the barriers faced by some students, such as the crippling cost of living, and finding solutions, such as the reintroduction of maintenance grants. We will also need a set of new initiatives to improve access for black students. The NES should pledge to tackle the attainment gap of black students in our further and higher education systems.”Shakira Martin is the president of the National Union of Students “If Labour wishes to create a truly national education service it must deal with the private schools. A gilded class of privileged children help themselves to the best university places and top jobs at the expense of state school students. Abolishing the VAT exemption on private school fees is a good start.“But a national education service must also make use of the big public schools and their wealthy endowments, which were established to educate the poor. Incorporating the 600,000 private school pupils into an NES would not only be cost-neutral but add value to the state school estate. Having these families cheering on their children shoulder to shoulder with other parents would help raise standards across the state sector while making our communities stronger.”Robert Verkaik is author of Posh Boys“Education should be about young people and adults finding their strengths and their potential – what it means to be their best selves. Now it is being driven by fear and all the emphasis on data and results is fracturing the system and working against the reason most people came into the profession. Children are being made to feel that education is about exam grades and headteachers are under enormous pressure from the completely flawed accountability systems.”Viv Grant is a former headteacher who coaches other heads“Abolishing tuition fees creates the opportunity for a fresh start. A new funding council for adults, apprenticeships, further and higher education should be created to provide vital investment in the people’s education and skills. Generously resourced, it must replace tuition fees pound for pound with government grants. Institutional autonomy, as well as academic freedom, must be strengthened and strictly respected as a vital ingredient in a democratic society. Legislation should be passed to ensure that education at all levels is provided by not-for-profit independent institutions, whose students and staff have a real say in their institution’s governance, alongside community representatives.”David Green is the vice-chancellor of the University of Worcester Jules White is headteacher of Tanbridge House School, West Sussex“I would like artificial intelligence to be taken more seriously, something the government has failed to do until very recently. AI will totally transform British schools and universities within a decade.

It does not include independent organic retailers or vegetable box schemes. The figures provide a half-year ‘progress report’ before publication of the sector’s detailed Organic Market Report and full breakdown in February.“We know that interest in organic food has been growing in recent years and it’s great to see that farmers continue to be rewarded for growing food as it should be, with no artificial additivies, fewer pesticides, no GM and with the highest standards of animal welfare” said Liz Bowles, Soil Association’s head of farming. “Sales in 2018 are continuing to grow although all UK agricultural businesses are suffering from the unprecedented drought and heat which has affected large parts of the globe.”Sales of organic food and drink have bounced back after plummeting following the recession.

But not many of them. And none as rivetingly awkward in quite the same way – awkward to an end, pointedly awkward, awkward with a certain kind of gain in mind and above all, just really awkward.Ferrington put it to Mourinho that Romelu Lukaku had told her his manager was a totally different man on the training pitch. At which point it all went a bit fuzzy. Mourinho paused. He took a breath. Something weird seemed to be happening to his face. The eyes were the same, still ablaze with the familiar righteous fury, the eyes of a notoriously vengeful star federation president about to unleash the unimaginable fury of his planetary destructor beam on the cowering scum of this peace-loving rural idyll.But Mourinho’s mouth was doing something strange, curling just a little at the edges, in what appeared to be an unaccustomed “up” direction, almost like a smile. “People who know me, they like me,” he mumbled eventually, a bead of sweat breaking out on his forehead as through sheer force of will he summoned up what might have been a genial twinkle. This was something new. This was novel, and even a little disturbing. This was José being nice.It is, of course, necessary to issue general apologies at this point. Yes, it’s another José Mourinho article. Let’s face it, this is to be expected at the start of a Premier League season that has so far been a fairly room temperature affair elsewhere. Like United, Mourinho remains an object of fascination, in part because he has always intended this to be the case. And partly also because this latest gambit, new Nice José, José of the people uniting the fans, is so clearly a plan, something that has been discussed and settled on to change the weather around the club.This was evident from the moment at the end of the Tottenham game when Mourinho stayed to applaud the home crowd very publicly, smiling like a shark at a birthday party. Mourinho was there again applauding the fans at Burnley, as he generally does, but more pointedly this time, a surprisingly urgent figure suddenly, transformed into a footballing version of Victor Laszlo in Casablanca, an elegantly turned out man of the people, populist in a grey zip-neck sweater. The players are on board too. “United now more than ever” David de Gea tweeted on Thursday night. A few hours later Eric Bailly went with “Now More than Ever … Together”. Jesse Lingard offered the hashtag #UnitedTogether.This feels like a welcome move on many levels, both personal and tactical. United were expected to beat Burnley at Turf Moor. Sunday’s performance may mean nothing at all, a brief spike in a parabola of sullen decline that most assume will culminate in a toxic farewell within the year. But taken together with the first half against Tottenham last Monday there was something structurally different, an altered angle of approach.Persona, attitude, the styling of his managerial personality: this is important to Mourinho, a major part of his professional voodoo. Finding an approach, a set of tactics and a persona that fits with his players is key. Something about the way Mourinho has presented himself in the last week speaks to the way he has done this, successfully, in the past.The fact remains Mourinho has only ever really been his best self, only achieved extraordinary things when he has been the underdog, when his team have come from outside the elite to beat the elite. Most obviously at Porto, but also at Internazionale where a mixed team of might-bes and old lags won a first European Cup in 45 years. Even Chelsea were a club ready to be led in 2004, moneyed arrivistes driven on to a first League title since the days of Ted Drake.Mourinho got so good at managing top-level underdog clubs he was allowed to manage top-level overdog clubs. And it is here the congealment set in. Mourinho wants to disrupt, to destroy your expensively acquired plans and impose his own will. It requires constant drilling, players who are willing to suffer and an audience willing to take pleasure in a little darkness. This best Mourinho was a populist outsider. At Real Madrid and now at United he has been an un-populist insider, become the kind of man he had always hated, or sought to bring down.And so on to new Nice José, the populist underdog, the unity candidate. To his credit, and however awkwardly, Mourinho is making efforts to unite his base, to create a winning spirit, to re-forge those bonds. Best of all this coincided at Burnley, and for half a game against Tottenham, with a more José-looking team, a return to the pared-down, hard-running football of his best XIs.Lukaku played less with his back to goal, and instead ran with real verve and intelligence into space on either flank. At times he was devastating, an old school Mourinho-style leader from the front in the style of Diego Milito or Didier Drogba. Behind him Paul Pogba had the right kind of entourage, two defensive midfielders allowing him to pass more, make the play, show his range of angles. Last season Pogba was 19th on the list of accurate long passes from central midfield in the Premier League. Currently he is fourth this season. Against Burnley his link-ups with Lukaku were instant and incisive, direct football in the best Mourinho sense.Two years ago Antonio Conte reconfigured his Chelsea team to devastating effect over the autumn international break. It may be too much to expect something similar. But Mourinho is at least trying something else here, a little grudging charm where the snarls had begun to drag everyone down, and a slight, perhaps incidental modification of his team along simpler, more classically Mourinho lines in its past two matches.The charm offensive may, in the end, prove a bridge too far but at least there is some hope, whatever the outcome of his third season, that Mourinho will not leave United without ever having really wrestled this team into something resembling one of his own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9396ba6c8aa0ae8aa67ffb43b0fb79f9ebd209f6/50_123_5650_3390/master/5650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9d42d52e214ea8c4b6075a5398384a5","title":"funding circle launches 2bn stock market flotation plan","story":"Company’s three co-founders in line for combined windfall of £70mThree friends who met at university are in line for a combined windfall of £70m after revealing plans for a £2bn float of Funding Circle, the British peer-to-peer lending business they founded eight years ago.Funding Circle, which allows small firms to tap into a pool of money provided by thousands of investors, aims to raise £300m in a stock market float valuing the company at up to £1.95bn.Funding Circle offers loans of up to £1m to firms that want to raise capital quickly or have been turned down by a bank. Its model, which relies on sophisticated data analytics, has resulted in the issuance of £5bn of loans since 2010 by matching 50,000 businesses directly with 80,000 investors.The company said it would use the £300m it hoped to raise to fund expansion into new countries and to “engender trust” with borrowers, lenders and regulators. It added that raising the cash would help it pursue growth without worrying about profitability in the medium term.Despite rapid revenue growth, up from £51m in 2016 to £94.5m in 2017, the company racked up losses of more than £70m during those two years.Desai said the company was only losing money because of the cost of building its business overseas, insisting that its UK operation was already profitable. He said the company would become more profitable as it reduced investments and started to rely more on repeat borrowers, who cost less to acquire and to vet.According to Funding Circle’s last set of accounts, revenues have been boosted as the company stepped into the space vacated by banks showing caution about lending amid economic uncertainty caused by Brexit. Revenues nearly doubled last year and are on course to show further growth for 2018, with half-year revenues already at £63m compared with £41m in the first six months of 2017.Desai said Funding Circle would survive in the event of an economic crash that could affect the ability of borrowers to pay back investors.He said the firm had deployed the same stress-testing criteria used by the Prudential Regulatory Authority, a UK regulator that monitors the health of the banking system, to track the resilience of banks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66aedb72f494d36b22642f53653edf08e83ebee2/0_80_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f2d79e3e5aa6ccec32563a01926374","title":"michel legrand interview film soundtrack legend composer","story":"He wrote the soundtracks to some of the greatest films ever, winning Oscars and partying with the stars. As he hits Britain, the 86-year-old Frenchman recalls fights with his mother – and benders with Miles DavisA few minutes before I’m due to press the buzzer on the door of Michel Legrand’s apartment building in Paris, the announcement of Aretha Franklin’s death comes through. He greets the news with a sigh. Many years ago, he remembers, he had a plan to team Aretha with Ray Charles on a new recording of Porgy and Bess, updating the version made by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald in 1958. He sighs again. It would have been wonderful, he says.His anecdote hardly comes as a surprise. Legrand seems to have worked, at one time or another, with practically every figure of consequence in popular music and film since the end of the second world war, from Maurice Chevalier to Sting and from Orson Welles to Jean-Luc Godard. And he has stories about all of them.The interview was supposed to take place in his country home, the Château de la Mothe, south of Paris, where he lives with his third wife, the actor Macha Méril, whom he married in 2014, four decades after they first met. When a dental emergency forced a postponement, he asked to meet instead at his apartment in the Marais. He needed to be in Paris, he said, for a meeting about a new theatre production of Peau d’âne, a film he made with Jacques Demy almost 50 years ago, a musical that followed their great box-office successes with Les Parapluies de Cherbourg and Les Demoiselles de Rochefort. “Big production,” he says. “Big orchestra. Some writing.”At 86, Legrand continues to live up to the saying that if you want something done, ask a busy person. He is a little frail now, and occasionally he has trouble remembering the name of a friend or a film from long ago. But nothing – not even an illness that struck him during a flight on a Russian airliner, putting him in a coma – will make him pause to rest on the laurels amassed, in particular, from writing the scores for more than 200 films, winning Oscars and Grammys while lodging such songs as The Windmills of Your Mind (from The Thomas Crown Affair) and What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life? (from The Happy Ending) in the global memory.Towards the end of the interview he tells me that he now ides his professional life into distinct chapters. The first was in the 1950s, when he was an arranger for famous singers, including Chevalier and Jacques Brel. In the 60s he wrote music for important films by the French new wave directors – Godard, Demy, Agnès Varda and so on. Then he moved to the US and scored dozens of Hollywood movies, from Joseph Losey’s The Go-Between and Welles’s F for Fake to Steve McQueen’s Le Mans and Robert Altman’s Prêt-à-porter, as well as popping back to Europe to work with Andrzej Wajda, Claude Lelouch and others. Next he concentrated for several years on writing musicals. “When I hit 80,” he concludes, “I knew that the last chapter of my work would be classical. So I wrote a piano concerto that I recorded myself, a cello concerto, a harp concerto, some sonatas. I wrote a huge ballet. I’m very proud of that. It’s a good final chapter.”And during the last chapter – if that is really what it turns out to be – there is also time for a series of concerts, including one in London this month, when he will conduct orchestral arrangements of music from his soundtracks. And, no doubt, play a little piano and sing a couple of the famous songs on which he collaborated with a variety of lyricists, providing glimpses of a talent that, as he remembers, could have gone in many directions.“When I finished at the Paris Conservatoire,” he says, “I was 20 and I felt I could do everything. I could write symphonies. I could be a virtuoso classical pianist, but to do that I had to work 12 hours a day. I could be a jazz pianist – I liked that very much, because you’re free and I know how to improvise. I could be a singer. I could be a conductor. So I said my dream in my life is to do it all.”“I taught myself to write music, so that when I was five or six years old I was very much ahead. Finally my mother saw that I was interested in the piano and nothing else. So in 1942, in the middle of the occupation, I went to the Conservatoire. You go to that building for the first time and when you open the door it’s music and nothing else. I was 10 years old and I said, ‘That’s my world.’” Among his teachers was the celebrated Nadia Boulanger, whose later pupils included Astor Piazzolla and Philip Glass. “I hated her sometimes because she was so demanding, but she was extraordinary. She made me.”It’s the story of a pivotal moment in his career. In 1954, a friend who worked at a record company told him that its US partner, Columbia Records, wanted to make an easy-listening orchestral album with a Parisian theme. None of the big-name American arrangers was interested. The 22-year-old Legrand jumped at the opportunity, despite being told that he would be paid only $200, with no royalties. I Love Paris, as it was titled, topped the charts and sold millions. So when he visited the US as Chevalier’s musical director in 1958, Columbia offered compensation in the form of paying for an album of his arrangements of jazz standards featuring top American jazz musicians, including Davis. Released as Legrand Jazz, it established his credibility.He and Davis became friends and collaborated again in 1991, shortly before the trumpeter’s death, on a film called Dingo, directed by Rolf de Heer. “Miles called me up and said, ‘Michel, you’d better bring your fucking ass to Los Angeles next week because we’re doing a film. I agreed to do it on condition that you are with me.’ So I push all my work away. I go to his house in Malibu. We talk a lot, we drink a lot, we eat a lot. Friday arrives, the sessions are starting on Monday, and we haven’t written anything yet. Miles says, ‘We shouldn’t do it.’ I say, ‘Miles, that’s not nice, a young man is counting on you. OK, I have an idea. I’ll go to my hotel and I’ll compose everything in four days and four nights. On Wednesday I’ll record the orchestra and Saturday you come.’ He says, ‘Michel – I knew you were a genius.’ That bastard. An adventure! I love this very much.”Before saying goodbye he returns to the subject of the London concert, in which he hopes to conduct his compositions against projections of the scenes they originally accompanied. When I mention the highly charged seven-and-a-half-minute chess game between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in The Thomas Crown Affair, he mentions that the director, Norman Jewison, cut the scene to fit the music, which begins with a solo harp and ends with a big band playing a jazz waltz.“I want to try to explain what happened, to tell the audience what I’ve done,” he says. “Every movie that I’ve scored, I’ve tried to be original, to be different from what we’re used to listening to. When I write music, my music talks. It’s not a music that says nothing, a tapestry where nothing happens, like most of the composers. I think I’ve been an adventurer – in life, in my work, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce29e173287767c534c94d5812b84e6a16411a6/123_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a138e6d08a5d1f4e6e6a27564e7f5bf","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves. But while animals generally confine themselves to bashing things with the odd rock, in extraordinary footage broadcast last year as part of the BBC’s Spy in the Wild series, a wild female orangutan is seen using a saw she has found outside a hut to cut through a log – even pausing to blow away sawdust before continuing.In the wild, orangutans use large sticks to get at honey inside logs, shelter from the rain by fashioning umbrellas out of leaves and hold bunches of leaves in front of their mouths to lower the pitch of their calls to scare off predators. Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

He stirred national debate by taking a knee while the anthem was played before games during the 2016 season, to draw attention to police killings of African Americans and other issues.Kaepernick tweeted a black-and-white photo of himself on Monday featuring the Nike logo and “just do it” slogan as well as a quote: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”Nike has endorsed Kaepernick since 2011 but has not featured him in campaigns since his departure from the NFL.“We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward,” the Nike executive Gino Fisanotti told ESPN. “We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce ‘Just Do It’ to a new generation of athletes.”The protests during the national anthem, soon embraced by other players, raised the ire of some NFL fans, Republican politicians and President Donald Trump.Trump said the players disrespected the American flag and the military, and has said he would love to see NFL owners fire such players.Kaepernick and another former 49ers player, Eric Reid, have not been signed by any of the NFL’s 32 teams since their protests spread. Both have filed collusion grievances against NFL owners.On Thursday, arbitrator Stephen Burbank denied the league’s request to dismiss the case, which means he found sufficient evidence for the case to continue and perhaps go to trial.News of Nike’s ad campaign broke just days before the first game of the NFL season on Thursday, when the controversy over pre-game protests could flare anew.Serena Williams was among those who praised the ad, and earlier lauded Kaepernick and Reid. “I think every athlete, every human, and definitely every African-American should be completely grateful and honored how Colin and Eric are doing so much more for the greater good,” she said at the weekend.However, it also drew criticism from some quarters, including the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.Others on social media posted videos of Nike shoes burning and Nike socks with the “swoosh” symbol cut out.Kaepernick received an enthusiastic welcome from fans at the US Open’s showcase match between Serena and Venus Williams in New York on Friday night, when he was shown raising his fist on the big screen. “Especially proud to be a part of the Nike family today,” tweeted the former after news of Kaepernick’s deal emerged.Kaepernick has also found backing from an unlikely source: the former president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. “The #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster. Even though he is one of the best Quarterbacks in the league,” wrote Ahmadinejad on Twitter on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc1b38a54a7b46cb1665bb359c3584e47f9c3c/0_25_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cdd7138fb256d8b5bddaec9bcd56996","title":"matt oconnor sacked","story":"• Australian shows the door after 40-6 thrashing at Exeter• Geordan Murphy to help fill coaching gapThe season is barely one game old but Leicester have already seen enough to persuade them to part company with their head coach, Matt O’Connor. The Australian has left Welford Road with immediate effect in the wake of the Tigers’ 40-6 opening weekend mauling at Exeter.Even by the increasingly brutal standards of professional sport the sacking qualifies among the more spectacular knee-jerk reactions of modern times, with the former Irish international Geordan Murphy now in temporary charge. O’Connor, however, had already started this season under pressure following his team’s failure to finish in the Premiership’s top four for the first time since 2004.The Tigers are unaccustomed to such mediocrity and the grim second-half showing at Sandy Park has clearly exhausted the board’s patience. “Matt was appointed head coach in April 2017 on the basis of his previous Premiership experience and his knowledge of the club,” said Leicester’s chairman, Peter Tom.”We believe the time is right to make this change in the best interests of the Tigers moving forward. We would like to thank Matt for his hard work and commitment.”O’Connor began his second spell at the club in the closing stages of the 2016-17 season and helped Tigers into the Premiership semi-finals that year. During his first stint the former Wallaby international enjoyed a productive partnership with the former director of rugby Richard Cockerill but these days Leicester are increasingly choking on the fumes of the country’s current pacesetters Saracens and Exeter.Murphy, an eight-time Premiership title winner and double European champion in his 16 years as a player at Tigers, will take over on an interim basis alongside fellow coaches Mark Bakewell, Boris Stankovich and Brett Deacon but Mike Ford, father of the Tigers’ England fly-half, George, is already among the names being linked with the vacancy.It would have been a good deal easier to change tack in the summer, rather than within 72 hours of the league season kicking off, and the Tigers board are beginning to look increasingly indecisive. The club sacked Cockerill in January 2017, opted to part company with his initial replacement, Aaron Mauger, three months later and, 16 months on, have now ditched O’Connor as well.The home supporters will also be quick to appreciate the irony when they welcome their next opponents Newcastle, guided by the former Tigers’ legend Dean Richards, to Welford Road this Saturday. If Leicester were to lose and also struggle away to new midlands rivals Wasps in Coventry, in round three it really would represent the start from hell.No pressure, then, on the much-liked Murphy who has been lobbed the warmest of hot potatoes.“As a club Leicester Tigers will always aspire to challenge for major honours in the incredibly competitive arena of professional elite club rugby and everyone at the club will fully support Geordan and the management group in driving the team forward,” said Tom. “Geordan knows the expectations and ambitions of the Tigers as well as anyone after more than 20 years here as player and coach, and we wish him and the team the very best for the challenges ahead.”Murphy’s first job will be to fill the hole left by the departure of the centre Matt Toomua and Tatafu Polota-Nau back to Australia where they are set to be involved for the Wallabies against South Africa in Brisbane. What the coaching outlook will be looking like at Leicester by the time the pair return to the UK is currently anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42980ea872d71ab752e5db403469bf0b5108ba33/39_227_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db159db23d79ca088409338bbfeef1b","title":"sebastian vettel ferrari italian grand prix lewis hamilton max verstappen","story":"Ferrari had looked strong going into the Italian Grand Prix but did not make the most of it while Max Verstappen shows the trait of champions in believing he can do no wrongFerrari and Sebastian Vettel must have concerns about how they did not manage to return the win that had looked so likely as the Italian Grand Prix weekend progressed.Their cars had looked strong through practice and qualifying and, having locked out the front row, they held all the cards. Vettel will doubtless have a long talk with his team about why he was not given the best shot at pole, which might have kept him out of Lewis Hamilton’s reach at the start, given he is in the title fight. However, he must also look to his own part in hitting Hamilton and his resultant fourth place. It is his fourth race error this year, a count of which Ferrari will be more than aware, especially given they are in the best position in a decade to win the championship. Kimi Räikkönen was simply outmanoeuvred by a formidable Mercedes strategy and Hamilton’s skill but the real pressure is on Vettel, who must now deliver without any misjudgments in the remaining seven races.Much was made of the booing in Monza but it is nothing new. This crowd has always been passionate, indeed it is what imbues the venue with such atmosphere. They have been showing a healthy disregard for anyone not driving a red car for years – Vettel was booed after his wins for Red Bull – and it is in equal proportion to the devotion they show to anyone representing Ferrari. Should Hamilton ever drive for them, and return the wins they desire, it is to be expected they would take to him in the same way they have to many non-Italian drivers including Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda, Jean Alesi and of course Nigel “Il Leone” Mansell. Hamilton admitted it did nothing but spur him on and both he and Valtteri Bottas accepted that it was a part of sport. Some may find it distasteful but it is a reflection of the fervour of these fans and in truth often at Monza little more than pantomime in nature.Hamilton rated the race as “up there” with his greatest drives. Should he go on to take the title he may feel this is was a decisive moment and this win may go even higher in his estimation. He certainly served notice in Monza that he will take some beating. His drive suggests he is exhibiting perhaps the best form of his career.It was a complete performance on many levels, his racecraft was exceptional, especially in the two passes on Vettel and Räikkönen. Opportunistic and inch perfect on the German, he saw a chance and took it and did leave Vettel enough room. On Räikkönen his judgment on late-braking round the outside into the chicane was nerveless. Conceding his place to Räikkönen when the Finn fought back at Roggia was an object lesson in playing the long game. Added to all of which was the calm tyre management that ultimately helped ensure an unlikely win. He was at the heart of a brilliant race.After coming out of his early season travails and seemingly vindicated in sticking to his guns by refusing to change his driving style, Max Verstappen was once again convinced he was in the right in Monza – except he was wasn’t. He was adamant he had given Bottas enough room as the pair vied going into the first chicane – except he hadn’t. He clearly moved to the left in the braking zone and, because he had not left a full car’s width, hit Bottas, forced him on to the grass and into missing the corner. When his team told him he had a five-second penalty his response was classic Verstappen. “Don’t worry about it? It’s fucked,” he said. “I gave him space. They’re doing a great job of killing racing, honestly.” He was bullish afterwards in denying he had been at fault and was defended by legions of his fans.His talent is undoubted and on this evidence he also shares the trait shown by some of the greatest champions in believing they can do no wrong – regardless of the evidence.Marcus Ericsson’s 220mph crash after his DRS failed to close as he applied the brakes heading into the first chicane was another salutary reminder of the dangers inherent in motor racing. It was all the more terrible because there was no warning nor any suggestion of driver error, he simply hit the brakes and veered left into the wall before cartwheeling three times. He walked away unharmed, and although this was not an incident in which the cockpit protection device, halo, played a part, the race director Charlie Whiting did have data on its role in Charles Leclerc’s crash in Spa. Whiting said the impact was equivalent to 5,000kg – half of the load the device is designed to withstand. “There was no distortion of the halo there was no buckling,” Whiting said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29978a802465e997a4e607491fafc51dbdb47e07/0_1183_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd571a865b7e0df52cd8c3fcd443a5b","title":"shakespeare by angus mcbean in pictures rsc","story":"Featuring Christopher Plummer as Richard III, Vivien Leigh as Viola and Charles Laughton as Bottom, Shakespeare by McBean is a volume of the photographer’s shots at the RSC between 1945-62 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc827a9589d87c57f1a780960f8e135b7243cda7/0_323_5264_3157/master/5264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a12ed18363d1729509321563e3d6d40","title":"a cooks tour kappabashi street tokyo kitchen town","story":"With its handmade chefs’ knives, ornate chopsticks and bento boxes, the Tokyo street where restaurants buy kitchenware is also a great place for tourists to pick up souvenirsThe first thing you notice when entering Tokyo’s Kappabashi Street is the towering chef statue. His 11-metre-high head, with a thick moustache and a crisp white chef’s hat, has come to symbolise this neighbourhood, known locally as Kitchen Town.The name fits as the 800-metre-long street is lined with more than 170 shops selling everything a professional or home cook could dream of. A short walk from two of Tokyo’s most popular tourist destinations – Sensō-ji Temple in Asakusa and Ueno Park – the district has been supplying the local restaurant trade for nearly a century.That is still its primary purpose but now it also attracts savvy visiting foodies who come to stock up on artisan pottery, high-quality Japanese chefs’ knives, handcrafted chopsticks, traditional bento boxes and a mind-boggling array of cooking utensils, (hello, wasabi grater!) for much less than they would pay elsewhere. Here are five must-visit shops.Many people travel to Kappabashi just to visit Kamata, a family-run business that opened in 1923. Kamata specialises in Japanese knives, or wabōcho, handmade by craftsmen in Sakai City, Osaka. Every knife undergoes a finishing process and inspection by the shop’s owner, Seiichi Kamata, who you may see clad in a blue apron working at a grindstone. It has a strong local following but Kamata’s English-speaking staff also help tourists pick out the perfect knife from the 800 types on sale, from a small vegetable knife (about £20) to a large handmade machete (up to £1,000). One of the most popular is the Damascus (£140), featuring a wood handle and a blade made from carbon steel (tamahagane) – the same metal used in samurai swords.• 2-12-6 Matsugaya, Taitō-ku, kap-kam. Open daily 10am-6pmJapanese artisans have been making ceramics, known as yakimono,since prehistoric times – especially so during the 16th century and the rise of the tea ceremony. Dengama celebrates this craft and is packed with more than 3,000 pieces of earthenware, stoneware and porcelain from some of Japan’s major kilns. Opened more recently than many of its neighbours (1995), the modern-looking shop sells handmade and factory-produced pieces, including serving platters (£3.50-£5), teacups and tea pots (£35-£42). It’s possible to be charged double or triple that amount in more touristy sections of town. Upstairs feels more like a museum and is reserved for more exclusive artisan work, including some of Japan’s signature pottery styles: like the clean, blue-and-white tako karakusa patterns and the oribe style of stoneware that tends to be more monochrome and asymmetrical.• Nishi-Asakusa 1-4-3, Taitō-ku, dengama.jp. Open daily 10am-7pmWelcome to chopstick heaven. This brightly lit shop displays more than 500 different types of chopsticks along the walls and in tidy drawers. Pairs start at £1.40 and go up to £70, depending on the material and design. The factory-made options make for affordable souvenirs (up to £5.50) in both wood and plastic. The handmade chopsticks in natural woods, such as ebony, rosewood, iron tree or bamboo, often come with a label telling you exactly where in Japan the tree came from. For an extra £3.50 it’s possible to have your name engraved on your purchase. • 3-25-11 Nishi Asakusa, Taitō-ku, kappabashi-mikura. Open daily 10am-5pmBased in the building that sports the huge chef statue, Niimi is hard to miss. It’s also one of the oldest shops here, having opened in 1907 before Kappabashi became popular with cooks and restaurateurs. While many shops on the street specialise in one product, Niimi is a one-stop-emporium, witha vast array of kitchenware: pots, pans, knives, soba dishes, sake decanters and more – all at affordable prices. Kids lunch plates (of which there is an enormous selection) go for about £14-£25 a piece.• 1-1-1 Matsugaya, Taitō-ku, kappabashi.or.jp.

But when the show first aired in 1999, it was genuinely innovative. Back at the height of ladette culture, you might yell “Girl Power!” before sinking a pint or four but feminism was a dirty word, associated with stuffy weirdos who took life too seriously. Sexual harassment? You’ve got to laugh …Into this minefield of gender politics skipped Loose Women, with its ironic title and cheerful determination to speak informally about modern womanhood. The first all-female panel show in the UK and one of the first in the world (it was preceded by The View, created by US journalist Barbara Walters a couple of years earlier), its very existence was revolutionary – daring to suggest that women might have life experiences that were worthy of discussion, unmediated by men (as the majority of daytime TV still is).For women stuck at home due to illness, retirement or caring responsibilities, it offered something that was hard to come by in the days before blogs and Facebook groups: community. And not just figuratively – you could call in with your opinion and actually have a discussion, rather than clicking “Dunno” on a Twitter poll. Sure, the eye-searing yellow, pink and turquoise colour scheme made the set look as if it had been pilfered from Play School, and early discussions about whether it’s scandalous to sunbathe topless or selfish to not want a baby suggested this wasn’t a hard-hitting enterprise. But it still had gravitas: former reporter Kaye Adams was usually head panellist, and had the brains, empathy and quick thinking needed to guide a live daily show without appealing to the lowest common denominator.The other original panellists – Nadia Sawalha, Karren Brady and Jane Moore – seemed to have been picked for their ability to respectfully express opinions, but as time went on, people were hired on the basis of name recognition rather than the quality of their conversation. Debates descended into slanging matches and, perhaps inevitably, a line was crossed when Janet Street-Porter compared Penny Lancaster to “someone in Hitler’s Germany”.The show became more isive after Adams left in 2006, even as Ruth Langsford and Andrea McLean gamely tried to fill her peacemaker role. She’s back occasionally, but the old magic isn’t. The show’s producers recently sensed that participating in clickbait culture would bring them publicity, and so it has become a showcase for manufactured outrage and the most obvious perspectives (e.g. the recent clash between Kim Woodburn and regular panellist Coleen Nolan).When Katie Price became a regular in 2016, it seemed as if it might finally be time to put viewers out of their misery. But after 19 years and more than 3,000 episodes, the programme shows no signs of stopping. The average woman’s life is 83 years, but Loose Women could outlive us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5812e20ccfaeb409638eb0b313bba5106615d239/0_0_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=623fa914c27844e39c63f05f4be1f916","title":"mothers day review gut wrenchingly hard to watch but hugely inspiring","story":"This was a touching, human, desperately sad drama about the IRA attack in Warrington that proved to be the catalyst for peace plus an innovative way of exploring the devastation wrought on the families of convicted paedophilesA woman sits in a hospital, consumed by anguished thought and accompanied by the sound of someone breathing through a ventilator. We don’t see the patient yet, but I think we know who it’s going to be. Then, memories of happier times – a newborn baby boy, Christmas, off to Scout camp – interspersed with violence: an explosion, Margaret Thatcher, sirens, John Major, the Troubles.Now, the same woman is bringing a new car back home, happily if a little nervously, with her husband. Her 12-year-old son, Tim, meanwhile, is shopping for Everton football shorts and a Mother’s Day card, in town. The town is Warrington, the date is 20 March 1993.It is gut-wrenchingly hard to watch a quarter of a century on, with us knowing something they don’t: what is about to happen. And then, three-and-a-half minutes into Nick Leather’s poignant BBC Two drama, it does happen: BOOM. A bomb, followed by numbed disbelief, a strange kind of muffled echoing, then an alarm and cries of distress.Tim is not seriously hurt. He does the right thing, he runs – the wrong way – straight into a second blast. And this time he is hurt, very seriously – “battlefield injuries”, the surgeon calls them. (Tim will die a few days later when his life support machine is switched off.)His parents get home in the new car and hear from the neighbours about the bombs on Bridge Street. Where’s Tim? And it becomes a different kind of difficult to watch.“Hello, sweetheart, hello … Mummy’s here,” says Wendy Parry (a mother’s distress and private grief so heartachingly encapsulated by Anna Maxwell Martin), reaching out to gently touch the head-to-toe-bandaged bundle that was her son. By which point you will have been devastated, too, especially if you’re a parent, wrapping up your child in bandages in your mind and weeping over them.Daniel Mays is also excellent as Colin Parry, channelling his grief in a different direction, towards ensuring his son didn’t die for nothing, and instead becomes a symbol of peace. And, across the Irish Sea in Dublin, another mother, Susan McHugh (Vicky McClure), says enough is enough and organises a public meeting that will lead to the Peace 93 campaign. Still not easy to watch, but at least not without hope.The story is not over-sentimentalised or Hollywoodified. McHugh isn’t portrayed as the saviour who brought peace to Northern Ireland merely as a small voice in that process. Just as Tim Parry – who along with three-year-old Johnathan Ball was killed in Warrington – are just two of 157 children who lost their lives during the Troubles. And the Warrington bombings were part of a vast, complex story.What Mother’s Day does is provide a way into that story – a touching, human, desperately sad, but ultimately inspiring way in.Equally hard to watch, also extraordinary: Married to a Paedophile (Channel 4). Even the process of making this is fascinating: it was first recorded as an audio documentary, with two families talking about their husbandsfathers being convicted of possessing indecent images. It was then filmed as a drama with actors lip-syncing the real people’s words. It does look a bit weird if you watch out for it, but it’s easy to forget and just go with it.What it provides is authenticity as well as anonymity for the participants – the importance of which is underlined when “Kate”, who lives in fear, shows the film-maker Colette Camden some of the things being said on social media: “Sod their human rights, got to wonder about the wife, this woman must be a whore.” That kind of thing. You just have to hope, for the actors’ sake, that any watching vigilante not known for their intelligence understands the process.Anyway, it means “Kate”, her convicted partner, their two daughters and “Helen” talk frankly of the trauma, betrayal and shame they feel. The result is a revealing exploration of the most difficult subject.God, what kind of return to work is this? A couple of days ago, I was in sunny Greece, drinking ouzo in my Speedos I come back to work, September, terrorist attacks and paedophiles. Shut up, though. I may not be the victim here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/756558af4d74b69029774e0ee55ea1964a5828a2/224_75_4972_2983/master/4972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c7da77a2d2f8ba592d1da333f9680da","title":"lena dunham forthcoming remake of camping","story":"It was a natural successor to Nighty Night but how will the 2016 comedy’s British sensibility translate Stateside?Looking back, the experience of watching Julia Davis’s Camping in 2016 was a little like my experience of actual camping. Having settled in for a hearty best-of-British break, suddenly the roof blew off and I realised I was stuck in a swamp of horror and couldn’t get home. Here’s the story: Robin (Steve Pemberton) is celebrating his 50th birthday with a camping trip, organised by his overbearing wife, Fiona (Vicki Pepperdine, later to join Davis in the brutally magnificent podcast Dear Joan and Jericha) and their son Archie, who unfortunately has an “elongated anus”.Their friends join them, among them Tom (Rufus Jones) and his horny new girlfriend, Fay (Davis), whose endless shagging exposes the others’ sexless lives. And then there’s the owner of the campsite, whose elderly mother is unseen yet everywhere, her stained pants flapping on the line like very distressing kites. She is incapacitated – “She can only suck now.”While Davis’s marvellous Nighty Night continued across two series (with a third still a possibility), Camping very much ends. It has an ending, one that I won’t spoil for the poor millions yet to see it, but one that made me scream, alone in my pyjamas. The darkness here is so black it’s blue. The news that Lena Dunham has developed it for a US audience (with Jennifer Garner as Pepperdine’s character and also starring David Tennant and Juliette Lewis) is a bit boggling will they be allowed, inclined, to show such bleakness? This gloaming grimness feels particularly British.Here, in the glorious English countryside, everyone hates each other. Camping is Mike Leigh’s Nuts in May reflected in a puddle of blood. I absolutely loved it. I love her, Julia Davis, whose portrayals of monstrous women I always find wildly liberating. I’m not alone, of course: Kylie Minogue watched Nighty Night while she was going through breast cancer treatment. George Michael was such a big fan that when he woke from a coma after a bout of pneumonia in 2012, he found himself speaking in the accent of the comedy’s lead character, Jill. Which reminds me of the cleansing light so many see when dying the presence of Jill at a moment of deathliness suggests Julia Davis’s brilliance is that she manages to find the basest frequency of our character and give it voice.

But the Crown Heights neighborhood was different. Musicians struck steel drums and people blasted reggae music from their sound systems, in New York City’s largest Caribbean celebration.More than a million people were expected to attended the annual J’Ouvert festival and West Indian Day parade. People covered in paint and wearing Caribbean flags as capes, skirts and headbands danced on street corners and stoops. Others wore enormous, brightly colored headdresses and intricate jeweled outfits as they weaved through stalls selling jerk chicken and roti. Ebony Smith said she had been coming to the festival for more than 20 years. This year she brought her daughter, Emani, for the first time. “She experiences so much of the American way of life,” said Smith, who wore a Jamaica headband. “I want her to experience the different cultures.”Zxavier Simpson has been attending for more than 15 years. He also felt it was important for children to attend.“As a kid,” he said, “this was a feast, seeing all the flags coming together, seeing everyone enjoy each other.”Simpson said he planned to broadcast the parade on social media, adding: “It’s a privilege to be here.”Events kicked off with the daybreak festival, J’Ouvert, which commemorates the emancipation of Trinidadian slaves and is a warm-up for the West Indian Day parade, which runs from 11am to 6pm.Rasudar Allen had woken up at 4am after finishing his intricate costume, a mishmash of fabric scraps covering a donkey shape, just after midnight. He said he planned to spend the day clad in the patchwork burrokeet, or donkey-man, costume, a Trinidad and Tobago tradition, because the festival was “very important in keeping the Caribbean and African culture alive”.“The artistic people that makes these costumes are able to display their talents,” he said.Longtime festival-goers said it was now a much different experience compared to decades ago, when the event attracted a significantly smaller police presence. In 2017, following a wave of shootings, the city introduced security measures including moving J’Ouvert to 6am instead of 4am and closing the parade route to the public on the previous night. On Monday, the New York City police department had checkpoints, vehicles and thousands of officers scattered across both parade routes and the streets between."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e562e1db22a1080d6c01eb7aa41972be1d9ee41/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a547fe6ea39fe8dc59a34dadeee045e","title":"steve bannon new yorker festival dropped","story":"Magazine rescinds invitation after guests including Jim Carrey and Judd Apatow pledge to withdraw from eventThe announcement that Steve Bannon would headline the New Yorker Festival in October caused a storm of controversy on Monday, leading a Pulitzer-winning writer to complain, guests to pull out and the invitation to be swiftly withdrawn.The magazine’s editor, David Remnick, first told the New York Times he would interview the former Trump aide and chief White House strategist in front of a live audience, with “every intention of asking him difficult questions and engaging in a serious and even combative conversation”.But Bannon’s espousal of far-right views and ties to white nationalist and alt-right groups have made him a polarising figure.She then provided a New Yorker email address.Schulz won a Pulitzer prize in 2016 for The Really Big One, a piece about the likelihood of a huge earthquake hitting the US west coast.She added: “I dearly love the magazine and I’m daily grateful to be a part of it. But I also believe that we owe those things we love the gift of honest criticism. (Also that we owe our own conscience obedience.)”Late on Monday, in a note announcing the cancellation of the interview that was immediately tweeted by staff writers, Remnick justified the invitation. It would not have provided an “unfiltered” platform for Bannon’s “‘ideas’ of white nationalism, racism, anti-semitism and illiberalism”, he said, adding that “to interview Bannon is not to endorse him”.But he said: “I don’t want well-meaning readers and staff members to think that I’ve ignored their concerns. I’ve thought this through and talked to colleagues – and I’ve re-considered. I’ve changed my mind. There is a better way to do this.”He added: “Our writers have interviewed Steve Bannon for the New Yorker before, and if the opportunity presents itself I’ll interview him in a more traditionally journalistic setting as we first discussed, and not on stage.”Bannon managed Donald Trump’s campaign in the final months of the 2016 election and was chief White House strategist until August the following year. He left in the aftermath of the deadly extremist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.In January this year he lost his role at Breitbart News and was excommunicated from Trump’s circle after he was extensively quoted in Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s explosive tell-all about the Trump White House.In his note, Remnick said Bannon had “exerted enormous impact on Trump” and “has not retired”.“His attempt to get Roy Moore elected in Alabama failed,” Remnick wrote, “but he has gone on to help further the trend of illiberal, nationalist movements around the country and abroad.” Bannon has travelled widely, passing comment on politics and supporting rightwing groups. In March, he appeared at an event staged by the Financial Times in New York. On Monday, an interview was broadcast on Australian television.On 9 September, the second anniversary of the day Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters “deplorables”, Bannon will release a film entitled Trump@War. He told Axios: “If you’re a deplorable, you’ll literally be standing on your chair with your pitchfork saying: ‘I’ve got to get people out to vote.’”Bannon said in a statement: “The reason for my acceptance was simple: I would be facing one of the most fearless journalists of his generation.

Bottled water and coolers will be provided so that thirst does not go unquenched.But the news about testing for toxic water is just the latest risk and indignity to be endured by the teachers and children in a district infamous for its “crumbling” public schools.The latest results come on the heels of previous tests from 2016 and spring 2018 that revealed elevated copper and lead levels, bringing the total number of schools with water quality issues to 34 out of the 106 Detroit currently operates.Vitti, who became superintendent in 2016, inherited a district that had been under emergency management for almost a decade. In an interview last Friday, he pointed out to the  that the decision was a preventive health measure.The shutdown of water fountains doesn’t apply to charter schools, but Detroit’s mayor, Mike Duggan, intends to initiate “the same level” of water quality testing at those schools, Vitti said.While drinking water is only one of multiple potential sources of lead contamination in the environment, young children are especially vulnerable to irreversible developmental damage because they absorb four to five times as much ingested lead as adults, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, copper poisoning causes vomiting and gastrointestinal issues, among other problems. Water testing in schools is currently not required by federal law or Michigan state law. However, a bill that would require lead testing in water is currently being considered in the state legislature.The Detroit Federation of Teachers, the local arm of the American Federation of Teachers union, supported the superintendent’s decision. The DFT president, Ivy Bailey, said that the district needed to develop a plan addressing test results, including using rainy day funds for repairs.She said she was told the problem wasn’t systemic but related to older plumbing in the fountains specifically. “It’s not the pipes in the buildings,” she said during a local briefing.The Great Lakes Water Authority and the Detroit water and sewerage department released a statement assuring Detroit residents they were not affected, indicating that the water passed all federal and state Safe Drinking Water Act regulations.Older drinking water fountains are “a known source of lead exposure”, said Stuart Batterman, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.Such water fountains were connected to a system with copper parts, fused together with lead, Batterman said.“That leaches out, dissolves into the water and the kids get that first flush, especially early in the morning when no one has used it,” he said.Detroit public schools have suffered from years of underfunding.Vitti said: “The infrastructure of the public school system has been neglected, and this is an example of it.In five years, the cost ends up being $1.3 billion.”Problems with lead are not restricted to Detroit schools, which make up the largest district in the state of Michigan. It took a pediatrician’s test results showing the alarming spikes in lead levels in the blood of children in Flint, Michigan, to finally bring that particular scandal to national attention in 2015. That prompted testing in schools across the country.This year, lead was found in school drinking water in Virginia, Texas and Chicago, according to news reports.“This is not a new problem,” said Batterman, adding that it had been a known issue since the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule, which requires public water suppliers to monitor drinking water for lead. He warned: “Basically, it has not progressed for 20 or 30 years. We are just not making headway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb12371ed514fd417050e34a132583dbbfa2cdb/0_94_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad6c84378dc3be98728c174db20819b","title":"corruption incompetence and a musical naurus riches to rags tale","story":"The once-wealthy island now barely survives on income from Australia’s detention regime and is pinning its economic hopes on undersea miningNauru is banking on fields of mineral-rich smooth brown rocks about the size of a potato that lie on the sea floor around the tiny island as the possible saviour of its fragile economy.For the island nation of just 10,000 people, financial viability has been a pressing problem since the exhaustion of its rich phosphate deposits in the 1970s.The nodules that lie 4km below the sea might be the answer. They are rich in the metals that are essential for the clean-energy industry: nickel, cobalt and manganese.The deep-sea mining venture needed to tap the resource is being led by a Canadian company, DeepGreen, which is run by an Australian entrepreneur, Gerard Barron, and backed by mining giant Glencore and shipping company Maersck. It is in the exploration phase but results are promising and it hopes to begin mining in 2025.For Nauru it will be just in time.At the moment Nauru’s main industry could perhaps be described as misery and suffering, courtesy of Australia’s offshore detention policies. Since 2013, when the offshore detention and processing centre reopened, Australia has been providing about two-thirds of Nauru’s GDP of $170m by way of direct aid, visa fees and payments to the government for hosting the refugees.But with hundreds of refugees sent to Nauru being resettled in the US and others moved to Australia, that industry is winding down, posing a new economic challenge for the troubled island nation.The story of tiny Nauru, once one of the wealthiest states per capita in the world, is a tale of rapacious colonialism, epic mismanagement, and avarice.Australia, New Zealand and Britain had nearly exhausted the viable deposits of phosphate by 1968 when Australia granted Nauru sovereignty, leaving behind one of the world’s worst environmental disasters.It might look like a Pacific island paradise but, thanks to phosphate mining, its interior is a moonscape of jagged limestone pinnacles unfit for agriculture or even building.There was talk in 1963 and again in 1970 of moving the 10,000 inhabitants to an island off Queensland, which the Nauruans opposed. Instead, the islanders have soldiered on as one of the smallest and most geographically isolated nations.The royalties from phosphate accumulated in a trust by the Nauruans – worth A$1.7bn at its peak – were squandered in the years following independence.By 2002, Nauru had stopped paying its loans, which had blown out thanks to the devaluation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar. GE Capital, which was owed US$239m on mortgaged properties, sent in the receivers.The assets, which included the 50-storey Nauru House in Collins Street, Melbourne, the Downtowner Motel in Carlton and the Mercure Hotel in Sydney, are long gone.A series of corrupt and incompetent governments found extravagant and spectacular ways to lose the country’s wealth, including, notoriously, funding a disastrous West End musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci.Nauru spent years in desperate penury as the country ran out of money. Its central bank went broke, its real estate overseas was repossessed, its planes seized from airport runways.As the financial crisis engulfed the island, it turned to exploiting its sovereignty. During the 1990s it transformed into a money-laundering haven selling banking licences and passports, including diplomatic passports, which confer immunity. Customers included the Russian mafia and al-Qaida.An estimated $70bn in Russian mafia money went through Nauru’s banks in 1998 alone.In 2002, the US treasury designated Nauru as a money-laundering state, alongside Ukraine, and imposed tough sanctions rivalling those slapped on Iraq.“Nauru is notorious for permitting the establishment of offshore banks with no physical presence in Nauru or in any other country,” the US treasury said. “These banks maintain no banking records that Nauru or any other jurisdiction can review. The evidence indicates that the entities that obtain these offshore banking licenses are subject to cursory and wholly inadequate review by the country’s officials and lack any credible ongoing supervision.”The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body that works to eliminate tax havens, has been working with Nauru to walk back from its foray into the wild west of finance.By 2004 Nauru had passed anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and the offshore banking sector seems to have disappeared as fast as it arrived.As of 2012, when the FATF reviewed Nauru, there were only 59 corporations registered under Nauru law, with a number of those pending for being struck off the registry. Fewer than five corporations per year have been registered over the past five years. In the past 10 years no new trust company licences have been issued, although 15 unit trusts have been formed under the 11 existing unit trust licences.However, it remains a secretive destination and learning anything about Nauru’s corporate sector remains difficult. There is no corporations registry online, and websites advertising tax havens still list Nauru as an option.In 2016, Westpac pulled out of providing banking on Nauru, citing concerns about compliance with international money-laundering regulations in a letter to customers. The only bank on the island is the Bendigo Bank, which opened in 2015.A few weeks ago the finance minister, David Adeang, announced that Nauru was fully compliant with the European Commission’s tax and financial security regulations, and had been removed from its grey list, although the EU has not yet published a formal statement.“Since the election of the Waqa government in 2013 we have worked very hard to lift Nauru’s international reputation, which was damaged over so many years by many former administrations due to greed and corruption,” Adeang said at an EU international tax seminar in Fiji last month.Nauru’s economy has also improved since 2013, thanks to one industry: refugee detention and processing for Australia.The first Nauru offshore detention experiment began in 2001, after the Tampa crisis. This was the catalyst for Australia to set up the camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea.It ran until 2007. The camp was bedevilled by problems: overcrowded tents and a shortage of water were the most pressing. Slowly it was established that, overwhelmingly, those who had come by boat were not “queue jumpers” or criminals or terrorists but rather people fleeing genuine persecution and who were owed protection. Most were resettled, and mostly in Australia.Nauru’s second iteration as an isle of detention, instituted by a Labor government and carried on with unswerving determination by the current Liberal-National Coalition government, began in 2012.The problems are undiminished. But the second Nauru detention regime, now formally replaced with a resettlement program on the island, has been kept carefully hidden. Foreign journalists – save for a handful of selected reporters – are forbidden entry to the island.The financial cost has been enormous. In 2017 a Senate committee was told Australia’s offshore immigration detention program – Nauru and Manus – had cost the federal government at least $5bn since 2012.Only part of that flowed to the economies of Nauru and PNG, as many of the functions needed to keep the reprocessing centres running – maintenance, garrisoning, legal assistance, welfare and health services – are provided by fly-in-fly-out Australian firms.But there are benefits. The Nauru government is paid resettlement fees, reimbursements towards the cost of its public services, jobs for locals and increased economic activity.That now raises the difficult question of what happens when Australia leaves.The dependence of Nauru on Australia and its offshore detention policies is revealed in Nauru’s own budget papers for 2018-19. Australia is responsible for directly providing at least two-thirds of Nauru’s revenue, which last year was $167m. It reported a balanced budget in 2017-18, spending all but a tiny sliver.Australian aid makes up a big share: $26m in 2018-19 , even as Australia has sought to prune its aid spending overall. This is despite the Department of Foreign Affairs’ own assessments for 2016-17 that the core programs in education and health are failing to meet benchmarks. The assessment on health slipped from amber to red.But there are also big licks of money coming from visa resettlement fees ($21m), reimbursements to Nauru’s department of justice and border control ($8.2m), and fees to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre corporation ($14m), which provides local staff.Australians coming and going from the island have breathed new life into Nauru Airlines, the only way to reach the island, while port charges are up and a major upgrade of the port, funded by the Asian Development Bank and Australia, is under way.Government spending has tracked up at the same pace as revenue, leaving the island vulnerable to a sudden change in circumstance.The Nauru government knows that the boom is coming to an end.In the short term, Nauru might get a bigger slice of the pie as Australian companies leave and hand over to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre Corporation in October.But after that the future is precarious.Most of the utilities, mining and even the shops and supermarket are controlled by Nauruan state government companies that did not file financial statements in time for the budget papers, so it’s hard to say what shape they are in.Eigigu, which runs the supermarkets, hotels and shops, is in dispute over its hotel in the Marshall Islands, which is closed.Mining of remnant phosphate deposits has slowed to a dribble. Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation (NRC), which took over mining operations in the last few years, is handing it back to Ronphos, the government-owned phosphate company, from July 1.In 2018-19 it is budgeting on making just $22m from phosphate but will spend $27.5m mining it, the budget papers say. The deficit is being funded by a loan from the Taiwanese government and only a quarter of the new equipment needed has been purchased.With little phosphate left, this appears to amount to shuffling of the deckchairs on the Titanic.As for rehabilitation of the island, the progress has been glacial.The NRC was set up after a financial settlement in 1993 by Australia of $135m in belated recognition of the environmental disaster it had wreaked on the island.NRC originally had a target of rehabilitating 400 hectares at the rate of 20 ha a year, but so far it has only rehabilitated a small area known as pit 6, which is being used as the site of the jail.The $135m appears to be gone. The budget papers say NRC’s balance sheet shows “a deficit in net worth” and that “future (donor and or Nauru government) external funding will be required for the NRC future work.”Meanwhile, Nauru is running out of land.The other big earner in recent years has been fishing. The government earned $43.14m last financial year in fees paid by foreign-flagged vessels to undertake what is called “purse seine fishing”. This involves putting out several kilometres of net in a circle, which is then closed from the bottom with a drawstring, trapping tuna and other species.The Nauru government has recently invested in two Korean-flagged tuna boats in an effort to secure a bigger cut of the fishing industry.The DeepGreen undersea mining project will need to be balanced with protecting these marine resources.DeepGreen has undertaken three exploration voyages and plans four more. It says the resource has proved very promising, with high concentrations of the mineral-rich nodules on the seafloor at a depth of 4km. It plans to begin commercial mining in 2025.Nauru’s president, Baron Waqa, is hopeful the venture will bring great benefits.“My government continues to look for other revenue sources for Nauru. Not just now, for the future. This venture with DeepGreen will ensure that our revenue will be well ersified for our children and their children well into the future,” Waqa said after the company reported that it had found significant resources in the territory around Nauru.DeepGreen’s Gerard Barron said under the agreement with Nauru, the company will pay royalties of “tens of millions” a year and make a significant contribution to the island’s GDP.The company is already offering training and job opportunities to Naruans on its exploration voyages. Barron believes undersea mining for minerals could be as transformative for the Pacific as oil was for the Middle East.“They’re the metals we need to build electric vehicle batteries, to build renewable energy storage, to build electricity-generating windmills and solar panels. At DeepGreen we call them metals for our future,” he said.But undersea mining is controversial. The Solwarra project, being undertaken by Nautilus Minerals off the coast of PNG, involves excavating and crushing up volcanic vents on the seafloor and then pumping the rubble to the surface. It’s been opposed by local communities and environmental groups.Barron says mining nodules has far less impact: the loose nodules are vacuumed up and pumped to the surface, with the residual water then pumped back down to avoid disturbing ocean temperatures.In anticipation of the end of the detention centre business, Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand and the Asian Development Bank have also begun paying into the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund, a sovereign wealth fund being managed by a board of donor representatives and Australian accounting firms.Its proceeds, currently $56m, cannot be spent until it builds to a critical mass. Nauru will make contributions, depending on its income each year. put detailed questions to the Nauru government but it did not respond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073c031cdbd6348b3ba327d5c1f31cc0f28016ad/234_955_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=521b42c12852b797c312833d4c69a907","title":"hong kong cedes part of west kowloon rail station to china in secretive ceremony","story":"About 1m sq ft of West Kowloon terminus will be controlled by mainland ChinaHong Kong has officially ceded part of a new high-speed railway station to mainland Chinese authorities, holding a secretive ceremony that raised fears over the autonomy of the former British colony.The West Kowloon rail terminus, in the heart of the city, will officially open on 23 September, linking Hong Kong with cities in southern China. About 1m sq ft will be under the control of Chinese police and customs officials, allowing for immigration checks before departure.Hong Kong was handed from the UK to China in 1997 under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”, where Beijing was given sovereignty but promised to allow the city to govern itself. It was also allowed to maintain rights unthinkable on the mainland, like freedom of speech and a separate legal system. Under the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, mainland laws do not extend to Hong Kong. But in recent years that autonomy has been eroded, with activists accusing China of exerting too much control on Hong Kong politics and society. Opponents see the rail station as a symbol of those shrinking freedoms, a white elephant meant to appease Chinese government goals to better integrate the city. Supporters have touted reduced travel times.During an early morning ceremony, the city’s transport secretary and a top Communist party official from Guangdong province jointly held a ceremony to “mark the commissioning of the mainland port area”. The event was closed to press and neither news media or local lawmakers were given advance notice. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, denied there was any attempt to cover up the event, saying: “There was nothing sneaky”.“It was not a ceremony per se,” she said, attempting to downplay the controversy but seeming to contradict an official government press release that used the term. The Hong Kong government is charging the mainland a token HK$1,000 (£99) a year in rent. The rail station sits in one of the most expensive areas for real estate in the world’s most expensive property market, and some opposition lawmakers have called the arrangement “laughable”.“The unlawful and unconstitutional joint checkpoint has been implemented forcefully – it has caused an irreparable damage to our legal system and rule of law. There is nothing to celebrate,” Tanya Chan, an opposition lawmaker, said on local radio, according to Hong Kong Free Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8fd01fa10a4e9765ced4b4ec476861ccbd64f81/0_0_4522_2714/master/4522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f7bd531579ec9910c7d6113233d501","title":"jacinda ardern takes extra flight nauru minimise time away from baby","story":"New Zealand PM will fly to Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru separately from her deputy, costing taxpayers tens of thousands of dollarsJacinda Ardern has defended making an air force Boeing 757 take an extra trip to the Pacific island of Nauru so she can minimise time away from her infant daughter.The New Zealand prime minister has asked that the plane fly back from the Pacific Islands Forum to pick her up, one day after her deputy departed for the three-day meeting.The cost to the taxpayer of the extra trip – estimated at between NZ$50,000 to NZ$100,000 (£25,000 to £50,000) – has been criticised.Ardern is still breastfeeding her 11-week-old daughter, Neve, who is too young to have the immunisations required to visit Nauru. The prime minister decided that while she could not miss the meeting, she also could not leave Neve for the full three days.After being questioned about whether she thought the one-day visit was a good use of taxpayer money, Ardern told reporters that she weighed the decision carefully. “The other option was for me not attend at all but, given the importance that we place on the relationships with the Pacific Islands in the reset, that equally didn’t feel like an option.” The “reset” is a reference to Ardern’s foreign policy in the Pacific.“When weighing up the logistics I asked officials to check the extra costs I would be imposing on the Crown if I were travelling separately. On balance I decided it was worth me travelling for the full day on the Wednesday to fulfil my obligations as prime minister.”The finance minister, Grant Robertson, said the government allocated the money for such trips each year. “So actually there is no additional money at all being spent there, it’s simply making use of that 757.”Others have criticised the decision. AM Show host Duncan Garner said he was “loathe to criticise a parent for wanting to be with their newborn … Been there, done that, understand it totally. But just pull out of the meeting.”Garner said Ardern should have instead let the deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Winston Peters, go by himself. “He’s more than capable of holding court with all the local leaders over a drink at happy hour. He can then come back and brief you, really simple. And better for the environment as well, not two flights.”Barry Soper, writing in the New Zealand Herald, pointed out that the new Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, would not be at the meeting. “If Ardern decided not to go because of baby Neve, surely the family focused Pacific leaders, more than any others, would have understood.”Ardern said the situation was unusual as her daughter was so young. “This is a unique set of circumstances, I don’t anticipate being in the situation again.” She is intending to take Neve with her on a trip to New York later in September for the UN general assembly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611383.1535552668!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the secret teacher meet ireland s biggest dosser","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Secret Teacher: “I can’t abide dossers. Expertly shaving just a couple of minutes off the start of every class amounts to a lot of saved time  over the course of a week.” Photo: iStockI can’t abide dossers. Expertly shaving just a couple of minutes off the start of every class amounts to a lot of saved time and energy over the course of a week.Forgetting something and having to nip out to get it brings a welcome breather half-way through a class, and when there’s an important appointment right at the end of the day an early exit means beating the end-of-school rush and the consequent traffic.Meet Mary, Ireland’s Biggest Dosser. She “teaches” next door to me and could single-handedly write the Dossing for Dummies manual.She and her children take the mother-child bond to a whole new level, so finely tuned is her children’s instinct for precisely when Mammy needs saving from work.Their teething problems and nasty bugs always coincide with Mary writing the in-house exams, so she will take a step back “if people don’t mind”.Astonishingly, her children’s parent-teacher meetings just happen to clash with staff meetings. I could go on but there isn’t any point.Nor is there any point in raising the subject with Mary, as everyone knows she has her union on speed dial, and won’t be long finding a fundamental maternal or human right that has been violated.More fool any union official who entertains such calls and colludes in helping the Marys to evade their basic pedagogical duties.In recent years our nation has demonstrated an admirable capacity to air its dirty laundry in public and courageously engage in frank discussions about it, the church abuse scandal being an obvious example.But I suspect the strategically-managed dossing will remain buried, despite its prevalence.A well-paid secure job sets one up for life. While the teaching profession is now in crisis, with interest dwindling, prospects poor and morale low, it was for many years both a highly respected and eagerly sought job.The dossers have contributed hugely to how perceptions of teachers have changed over the years.Not so long gone are the days when the priest, the guard and the teacher were the holy trinity of a community, especially in rural Ireland. All three have fallen dramatically from grace in different ways in recent years.Collusion contributes massively to the silent scandal that is the dosser teachers. Job security creates an “untouchable” aura around an inidual. Power, when wielded just the right way, prevents others from wanting to “take you on”.And fear very often prevents parents from complaining when they absolutely have grounds for doing so – fear that their child will bear the brunt of the fallout, fear that nothing will change anyway, fear that making a complaint will lead to far more stress and bother than just finding a way around the problem and riding it out while it lasts.And that’s where those who give grinds are on a real winner. Last week, in schools the length and breadth of the country, classroom teachers took the credit for marks to which a grinds teacher had contributed far more significantly. Saying nothing always amounts to collusion, even if it is, unfortunately, often the most sensible course of action.The holy grail for any young adult is securing a good job with long-term prospects. In our profession this is known as a CID, contract of indefinite duration (ie a job for life).While striving to attain CID, teachers engage in all sorts of extracurricular activities, and many cannot do enough to please school authorities. This is a critical stage in a teacher’s formative experience, as the buzz and the joy of working with the students outside the classroom can inspire them to be involved in such activities for life.Others are simply playing the game, and will abandon all the extras with more enthusiasm than they had ever shown for them in the first place the minute their CID comes through. Plenty of them drop the essentials as well as the extras, but not necessarily like hot coals nor indeed all at once.Obviously we are not all like that, but this piece isn’t about the effective and admirable teachers.In my experience the dossers and those who are at the top of their game rarely mix. They would make for strange bedfellows anyway, having so little in common. Teachers are generally courteous and professional to each other despite huge variations in how they perceive their role and conduct themselves.Those who share my frustration at the dossers giving everyone a bad name, and the parents or students who have suffered at the hands of a dosser, are probably thinking how easy it is for me to write anonymously.Some are undoubtedly willing me on to be the whistleblower that this scandal urgently needs.Well, that’s not going to happen. That’s not how it works. Fear and collusion ensure that I won’t – not for now anyway.But like much of our other dirty laundry, maybe one day this too will be aired for all to see and talk about.The “Secret Teacher” is a practising secondary school teacher.

File photograph: Getty ImagesMany universities are to be given quotas on the number of secondary teachers to be trained in key subjects for the first time to help ease a staffing “crisis” in classrooms.The move is likely to reduce the number of students who wish to teach in subjects where there is an oversupply of teachers, such as English, history and geography.On the other hand, more training places will be set aside for students who wish to teach subjects where there are acute shortages of qualified teachers, such as physics, maths, Irish and European languages.The subject quotas are to be introduced for National University of Ireland post- graduate teacher education programmes, the main route into secondary teaching. This will affect programmes at UCD, UCC, NUI Galway and Maynooth University.A new minimum requirement of an honours degree (or a 2:2) will also be required for all of its programmes.Other colleges, such as DCU – a major provider of teaching graduates – says it is keeping entry requirements for its postgraduate programmes under review. Hibernian, a private provider of teacher training, is unaffected.Mary Fleming, director of teacher education at NUI Galway, said the changes will help ensure our teacher education system is better able to respond to the needs of schools.“It is a big deal,” she said. “It means we have much more certainty over the number of graduates in subject areas and can work much more closely with schools.”The quotas will be based on information from the Department of Education’s steering group on teacher supply. School management bodies say a “crisis” in the supply of teachers in key subjects is undermining the quality of education for students.They say many students do not have qualified teachers for subjects such as science, maths and Irish.Dr Anne Looney of DCU said she was not convinced that turning potential students away from teaching on the basis of having the “wrong” subject was the best approach."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3617332.1536042012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"junior minister seeks support to block redevelopment of inchicore flats complex","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCatherine Byrne: ‘I believe that the proposal on the table for the former St Michael’s Estate site is simply the wrong one if it doesn’t include an option for long-term, permanent housing, alongside amenities and services which would benefit the community as a whole.’ Photograph: Alan Betson  Fine Gael junior minister Catherine Byrne is seeking the support of Dublin city councillors to block the redevelopment of St Michael’s Estate in Inchicore for cost-rental and social housing.Her senior colleague Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last July announced he was designating the site of the former council flat complex for the State’s first not-for-profit rental scheme.Councillors will debate the plans at a housing meeting on Thursday. However, Ms Byrne, Minister of State at the Department of Health, has asked that they meet her in Leinster House the previous day to discuss opposing the plans.In a letter to councillors she said: “You may have heard that I have stated my opposition to this plan on the basis that I believe the size and scale of this project represents over-development of the site. The plan as outlined proposes 30 per cent social housing units, 60 per cent cost-rental units, and ‘possibly’ 10 per cent affordable units for purchase.”Crime and antisocial behaviour were “serious issues facing our community at present and must be addressed before a huge new housing development gets under way”, she said. “I believe that the proposal on the table for the former St Michael’s Estate site is simply the wrong one if it doesn’t include an option for long-term, permanent housing, alongside amenities and services which would benefit the community as a whole.” Ms Byrne publicly clashed with Mr Murphy at an event in Inchicore in July when he announced his plans to develop a cost-rental estate, where the levels of rent would reflect the cost of providing the accommodation.His plans for the site would see the construction of about 470 homes, 30 of which would be used for social housing with 60 per cent available on a cost rental basis – for rent to low- and middle-income workers, earning up to €50,000 or €75,000 as a couple, at between 15 to 25 per cent below market rates. A further 10 per cent may be affordable purchase homes, or could also be used for cost rental, depending on market interest.Speaking at the event, Mr Murphy said the development would be a “game changer” for the rental market and had cross-party support.However, Ms Byrne, who was not an invited speaker at the event, took to the podium to castigate her senior colleague’s proposals. “It’s probably one of the worst plans I’ve seen put forward for this site,” she said.Prior to the announcement, the site had been approved by the council for a mixed-tenure development of 30 per cent social housing, 20 per cent affordable rental, and 50 per cent private homes for sale.Councillors have also received letters from Inchicore residents opposing the plan. Concerns have been raised about the lack of social and retail infrastructure in the area, and the prospect that, if cost rental was not successful, the apartments could revert to social housing, turning the area into a “ghetto for social housing”.Several residents have asked that the council defer its debate on the issue pending consultations with the local community."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3617122.1535998759!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the beginning of french politics as we know it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Charles de Gaulle (centre)  in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa (modern-day Republic of the Congo) in 1958.France’s Fifth Republic was born 60 years ago on Tuesday, when General Charles de Gaulle published a new constitution. It was the beginning of French politics as we know it.The maverick writer and future culture minister André Malraux orchestrated a showy ceremony on the Place de la République, replete with streamers, flags and flowers. Malraux had a 40-metre high “V” erected behind the statue at the centre of the square, symbolising the Roman numeral “five” but also the “V” of victory.At the appointed time, de Gaulle pulled up in a black Citroën. He moved his ungainly, six-foot, three-inch frame slowly up the steps to the platform, paused and raised his arms in the “V” sign. \u0026nbspThree-thousand policemen, armed with truncheons and tear gas cannisters, were deployed in blue vans around the square to counter left-wing protesters. In a ritual repeated countless times since, 10 demonstrators and six riot policemen ended up in hospital. Eighty-seven people were arrested.At the liberation of Paris 12 years earlier, de Gaulle had convinced the French that the US-led allied victory was theirs, that la France éternelle had, like him, resisted Nazi occupation.Disgusted by postwar political squabbling, de Gaulle went home to Colombey-les-Deux-Églises and sulked for 12 years. The parliamentary system fostered chronic instability, with governments changing every six months. The war in Algeria almost brought civil war to metropolitan France.In the spring of 1958, General Jacques Massu hatched “Operation Resurrection” to bring de Gaulle back to power. Civilian authorities welcomed him as a saviour. If they hadn’t, Massu was planning a coup on behalf of de Gaulle. At a press conference in May, de Gaulle asked “Why should I, at the age of 67, begin a career as a dictator?”De Gaulle endowed France with nuclear weapons, a belief in French universalism and grandeur, and a seat at the UN Security Council. He was lucid about the difficulty of governing such an unruly people. “How can you govern a country that has 246 varieties of cheese?” he famously quipped.Though de Gaulle is now regarded as the greatest Frenchman of the 20th century, the left long considered him a dictator. In 1965, the socialist politician François Mitterrand published a book about de Gaulle titled The permanent coup d’état. \u0026nbspDe Gaulle asked his most faithful lieutenant, Michel Debré, to draw up the constitution. “I was trying to create a synthesis between monarchy and republic,” de Gaulle was later quoted as saying. Not unlike Emmanuel Macron’s en même temps.The constitutional expert Maurice Duverger coined the phrase “republican monarchy” to describe the presidential office created by and for de Gaulle. The French president appoints ministers and presides over cabinet meetings, chooses all civil and military officials, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He has the right to rule by decree and can suspend the constitution altogether in the event of a national emergency. \u0026nbspThe ceremony on the Place de la République launched the campaign for a referendum on the new constitution. It passed by a stunning 80 per cent majority on September 28th. De Gaulle was inaugurated as the first president of the Fifth Republic the following January. But the May ’68 revolution was clearly a rejection of de Gaulle’s authoritarianism. He left office the following year, after losing a referendum on institutional reform.Presidential candidates, from Jean-Marie Le Pen on the far right to Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the far left, promised to move to a more democratic Sixth Republic if elected. But if they ever reached office, they would doubtless have learned to love de Gaulle’s constitution. After being de Gaulle’s fiercest opponent, Mitterrand was so monarchical during his 1981–1995 rule that humorists referred to him as Dieu.Bonapartiste and monarchique are the criticisms most often levelled at Macron. Since his solemn walk across the courtyard of the Louvre on the night of his election, to Macron’s use of châteaux at Versailles and Chambord, “Jupiter” too wields the symbols of monarchy.De Gaulle wrote the script for French leaders’ solitary exercise of power. When he appointed himself leader of the French Resistance in 1940, de Gaulle said he felt “alone and without protection, like a man at the edge of an ocean saying he will swim across it”.Being president is always an honour, sometimes a privilege, Macron told a class full of 11-year-olds when he visited a school with the minister of education on Monday.“Some days are easy. Others are not.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Taking part would be \u0026lsquograve humanitarian mistake\u0026rsquo for Russia and Iran, says TrumpTrump administration\u0026rsquos withdrawal of funding from UN agency Unrwa a bitter blowMilitary say electrical fault to blame war monitor says Israeli strike was causeThe late US senator advocated multiple pre-emptive wars to project US global power\u0026lsquoCourageous and respected\u0026rsquo Nasrin Sotoudeh has gone on hunger strike in Tehran prisonDiplomat calls for plan for civilians amid growing tensions over the rebel-held regionThe shelving of Aramco\u0026rsquos $100bn IPO heaps pressure on crown prince MohammedMore than 10,000 people killed in war and 8.4 million on brink of famineUS financial pressure seen as part of force exerted to accept \u0026lsquodeal of century\u0026rsquo with IsraelAl-Qaeda-linked group vows to fight on but insurgents in Syria province are increasingly idedDamascus says repatriation a top priority and urges foreign fiscal aid for resettlementMeetings with Egypt and UN intensify in effort to avoid new border war breaking outLatest demonstration drew 20,000 of whom 270 believed injured by soldiers firing bulletsFormer cricket player has promised to fight corruption and lift millions out of povertyThe items include family photographs, personal letters, medicine and a wheelchairKilling of dozens of children in Saudi-led coalition air strike raises stakes in desperate warBombardment of Rafah in 2014 killing 150 deemed to be for \u0026lsquoclear military purpose\u0026rsquoHarith al-Sudani spent 16 months posing as a militant jihadi, foiling dozens of attacksBomb was detonated under a police car and four security men were killed in shoot-outRiyadh defends attack as \u0026lsquolegitimate military action\u0026rsquo amid calls for independent inquiry"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

We\u0027re trying to pull the kids out of the school and get our tuition back. They wouldn\u0027t give us the number of the company that owns the school, but looking into that,” tweeted an astonished Mr Standaert. “The principal hung up on my wife when she called after saying it was \u0027international and good exercise\u0027 ... okay, yeah for adults maybe, but not 3-6 year old kids.”Lai Rong, the principal, told the local media that her goal was to teach the children about the varieties of dance. “Children are quite simple, they wouldn’t think such complicated thoughts about this,” Ms Lai told the New York Times. “They’d just think that it’s amazing for someone to be able to fly on a pole like that.”She said that her intentions had been misunderstood, adding: “My whole career in education has been destroyed by just this one event, just five minutes of performance.”Pressure had built up on the authorities to take action after footage of the video went viral on social media, provoking both bemused and shocked reactions. “Pole dancing is by nature sexy and flirtatious, and by that measure, it is for the eyes of adults, not young children,” said an anonymous user on Weibo, a popular Twitter-like microblog in China, reported Reuters. “Well, I’m speechless. Pole-dancing could be an Olympic sport in the future. It’s an art form. Should it be denounced because performers don’t wear much? Do you cover your eyes when you watch ing events and figure skating?” asked another. Please review our commenting policyTrump in renewed attack on Jeff Sessions over charges for Republican congressmenDagenham primary school engulfed by huge fire a day before start of termOne million urged to evacuate as strongest typhoon to hit Japan in 25 years makes landfallDonald Trump warns Assad, Iran and Russia against \u0026#39grave humanitarian mistake\u0026#39 of attacking IdlibScotland Yard to probe leaked Labour anti-Semitism dossier as party holds crunch talksRachael Bland, BBC presenter and cancer blogger, reveals she has just \u0026#39days left to live\u0026#39Heart age test: how old is yours?Anti-Semitism: Why the IHRA definition matters - and how it has engulfed LabourPlaque for \u0026#39first modern lesbian\u0026#39 Anne Lister to change after row over wordingHaqqani network founder and ally of bin Laden has died, Afghan Taliban saysMother of murdered schoolgirl Lucy McHugh urges Facebook to release murder suspects password Storm Gordon to hit US Gulf Coast as a hurricaneFamily watch axe-wielding burglars raid their south London home in terrifying doorbell footage Glue road signs to the floor for \u0026#39zombie pedestrians\u0026#39 on their phones, Government adviser saysPower showers could be restricted and households forced to install water meters, under drought plansVanity Fair, episode 2 review: the series hit its stride with some brilliant chemistry between Frances de la Tour and Olivia Cook\u0026#39Anti-Semitic\u0026#39 Corbyn ally Peter Willsman elected to Labour\u0026#39s ruling bodyEx-Army chief: I was quizzed by cops over death of Belfast gunman 45 years agoComment: I, too, got the knock on the door from Troubles investigators.

For example, the US and Canada offers international graduates the opportunity to stay and work for up to three years after graduation, and Australia for up to four years.Since the government scrapped the post-study work visa in 2012, international students in the UK have just four months following the end of their studies to find a job with a tier 2 sponsor.The number of overseas students remaining in the UK to work following their studies\u0026nbsphas fallen significantly since the closure of visa. In 2011, the numbers of students transferring into work visas was 46,875, compared to 6,037 in 2016 – a fall of 87 per cent.Professor Sir Steve Smith, vice-chancellor at the University of Exeter and chair of UUK\u0027s international policy network, told The Independent: “The UK as a country needs to make it absolutely clear that international students are absolutely welcome and the UK is open for business.“Now is the time - when we are 29 weeks away allegedly from Brexit - for the UK to make a grand statement about welcoming a new era where global talent can come to this country, study, work afterwards and thereby deal with the number one issue of the UK economy which is productivity growth with those skilled workers entering the workforce.”He added: “It is not Brexit in terms of the details of Brexit - it is the image, the hostile environment. I have never met anyone who I have talked to who isn\u0027t coming to the UK because of the details of Brexit - it\u0027s \u0027is the UK welcoming?’“What we are trying to do is put our offer on a par with our major competitors and to say that despite the trials and tribulations of Brexit, the UK and its universities are one of the great systems in the world.“We see no reason why that system should not be open to talented iniduals. Especially when we now know that they come to study, maybe stay on a little bit to work, and then leave.”Cap on international student visas could cost UK economy £2bn a yearFunding for EU students in UK to be honoured after Brexit\u0027University research projects at risk of collapse amid no-deal Brexit\u0027If the visa is not introduced, Sir Steve added that the UK could lose its\u0026nbspplace in the world as a leading destination for international students – and a number of university courses in science and technology would struggle to recruit as they are largely dependent on international students.Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International (UUKi), added that they could see “damage” to their research system if fewer international students decide to do masters and PhDs in the UK.Under the visa, all higher education institutions registered as Tier 4 sponsors would be able to sponsor their graduates to search for and gain work experience for up to two years without restriction on job level or salary, and without an employer sponsorship requirement.The call comes as a poll from Comres, of more than 4,000 British adults, reveals nearly three quarters (72 per cent) think international students should be able to stay in the UK post-graduation for at least a year to gain work.Stephen Isherwood, chief executive at the Institute of Student Employers, said: Allowing talented international students to work for a period post-study in the UK will help employers, large and small, to fill skills gaps.Student news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/09/ozzy-osbourne-live.jpg","title":"ozzy osbourne uk tour tickets how to get manchester london birmingham","story":"Created with Sketch.Former Black Sabbath frontman says he still has no plans to retireClick to followThe Independent CultureOzzy Osbourne has announced dates and venues for the UK leg of what he is calling his last ever tour.\u0026nbspThe former Black Sabbath frontman will perform at arenas in Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Birmingham and London in February next year, where he will be joined by special guests Judas Priest.\u0026nbspI\u0027ve been extremely blessed to have had two successful music careers, the 69-year-old said.

Merkel backs German ally who mocked Brexit to replace Juncker                Angela Merkel should be given TOP JOB at EU - insists ex-Labour MPShe criticised the Commission for defensive, evasive and at times combative responses to media questions on the arcane manoeuvres around the publication of vacancies and selection of candidates which preceded an appointment that Juncker and his fellow commissioners were always free to make.And she also blasted fellow commissioners for failing to question why Mr Juncker was rushing through a new job for his Chief of Staff.Mr Selmayr, whose combative style has won the German both admirers and many enemies in Brussels, will keep his job despite the findings.But the Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report does little to enhance the EU executive\u0027s reputation after the European Parliament accused Mr Juncker of a coup-like action just as backers of stronger EU institutions gear up to fight eurosceptics in elections next May.Jean-Claude Juncker (Image: REUTERS)A statement from the Ombudsman\u0027s office said: Our inquiry shows the precise steps the Commission took in order to make the appointment process appear normal.The Commission created an artificial sense of urgency to fill the post of Secretary-General in order to justify not publishing a vacancy notice.It also organised a Deputy Secretary-General selection procedure, not to fill that role, but rather to make Mr Selmayr Secretary-General in a rapid two-step appointment.All of this risked jeopardising the hard-won record of high EU administrative standards and consequently, the public trust.

Heres all you need to know...There are two different dates that mark the end of summer and the beginning of autumn.These depend if you are referring to astronomical autumn or the meteorological autumn.For meteorologists, summer comes to an end on August 31 and autumn begins on September 1, running until Thursday, November 30.But astronomers say summer ends on September 22 in the northern hemisphere and autumn begins on Friday, September 23.Both astronomers and meteorologists use different ways in deciding when the seasons change.For meteorologists, they use the Gregorian calendar to split the year into four equal periods to help them with weather forecasting.This means they define autumn as taking place in September, October and November - so for them, autumn begins on September 1 and runs until November 30.But astronomers base their seasons on celestial events, and for autumn, the date is decided when the hours of daylight and darkness are roughly the same.This usually occurs around September 21-23 in the northern hemisphere, and astronomers believe the first day of autumn lies within this region.There is also a third way of determining when autumn starts that is used by people who study phenology - plant and animal life cycles.They look to changes in the natural world to determine seasons changing such as leaves changing colours and autumn fruits ripening.But this relies more on weather, so the date for this can be open and change vastly each year.This year the autumn equinox in the northern hemisphere takes place on September 23 - the same day as the beginning of astronomical autumn.The autumn equinox marks the day when the northern hemisphere slightly tilts away from the sun, meaning days become shorter and the temperature begins to cool.This carries on until the winter solstice until the northern hemisphere begins to tip back towards the sun on its axis.The end of autumn officially falls on December 21."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What’s more, do they care?More than 17million people voted to leave the EU. Most have not changed their minds. They want our politicians to get on with it.Mrs May has also claimed that she is going to start focusing on her domestic agenda. About time.Away from Twitter and Westminster, voters aren’t worried about the latest Project Fear smear.They care about the NHS, schools, being able to afford a home, and money in their pockets.Mrs May said she was the PM for the “Just About Managings”.

As with most of her premiership, Mrs May mustered her best in an awkward situation.This approach helps explain why a poll shows that Tory voters believe she is the figure who can unite Britain, ahead of other leadership prospects.Meanwhile, Liam Fox writes on this page that Britain should be confident going forward as an independent nation.There might finally be light at the end of the Brexit tunnel.IT is shocking that schools are calling for pupils to bring in loo roll because of cuts.Others are cancelling lessons and closing early.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel. It did. He sent me my winnings but they apparently went astray.So he offered double-or-quits. The price stayed below 50 for yet another year – and is still only a bit higher today. My winnings, £60 in today’s money, allegedly went to a charity. I never saw any evidence of that either.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She returned home and found a listening device in her bedroom.Joanne told the court: He played me a recording in my own house and told me he had paid someone to place a device on the outside of my house which I did not believe.I went to a spy shop in Leeds and asked them, if I wanted to bug someones house what do you do? He told me what to look for. She later found a second device hidden behind a TV in her bedroom and Bamford, of Gildersome, near Leeds, was arrested.Bamford admitted stalking causing serious alarm or distress but a trial of issue was held yesterday after the prosecution and defence could not agree on the basis of his guilty plea.He claimed to have fitted only one of the listening devices and said she had fitted the other to keep tabs on another ex.But the judge, Recorder Anthony Hawks, said: I find the complainant entirely plausible.I find the defendant evasive and dishonest. I totally reject his account that the complainant was responsible.Im very concerned about the risk you may present to people. You were prepared to engage in a highly sophisticated way to stalk that woman.It goes without saying there can be little more terrifying for somebody to find out they are being listened to in their own home, the one place entitled to feel safe.It seems to me that this is an inevitable prison sentence. I regard these offences extremely serious and highly sinister.Bamford, who was jailed for 30 months in November 2015 at Leeds Crown Court for money laundering and dealing cannabis, was bailed and will be sentenced on October 19.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She attended the first event in his home village of Medbourne, near Market Harborough, Leics, three months after Lees murder but he later stopped returning her calls.Rebecca told Leicester crown court: He said he wanted to raise thousands and thousands. He spoke about large money and it was as if he was going to set Jack up for life.But she added: Jack or myself never received a penny. I tried to contact him and it got to the stage where there were no returned calls, no answers, no emails. I couldnt say how many times I tried. It was a fair few.“Gary invited us to Medbourne to the truck-pull event. I paid for my expenses - hotels and meals. It was so busy - there must have been hundreds maybe thousands of people. I thought the money was for Jack and a portion was for local charities. I have not received any money from the truck-pull event.“He told me he wanted to dedicate a song to Lee to raise more funds for Jack. He never told me how he would get the money to produce the single. I wouldn’t have allowed it if I knew the money was coming from the truck-pull event. I have not received any money from the charity single.“I contacted him about the money not long after the single was launched. I contacted him by phone, message and email. I tried a fair few times to contact him. We had conversations about the money in the past and he just said it would be as much as thousands - as if it was going to set Jack up for life.”Rebecca also said that if shed known Gardner was spending the cash on producing a charity single she wouldnt have allowed it.Prosecutor Samuel Skinner said it was not known exactly how much Gardner raised from the 2013 truck-pull and two similar events in 2015 because he kept no records. But analysis of bank statements suggests it was at least £24,000.Mr Skinner said: He used donors money to finance a charity music single without the permission of the donors because he wanted to become a music promoter. In any event, the defendant used some of the money for a purpose that the original donors never intended and would not have approved if they had known.It appears that the defendant has spent all the money he received. He has not given Jack Rigby, or his trust fund, any money. The defendant has said the cost of running the charity events limited the amount available for donation.However, the defendant appears to have an enthusiasm for promoting ‘emerging music artists’, and it is the showcasing of these artists to the public with himself as the manager or producer that has swallowed up most of the verifiable donations.”In February 2014, Gardner launched the charity single Miss You Machine in Trafalgar Square and enlisted retired soldiers from Lees Royal Fusiliers regiment to collect donations.Mr Skinner said: They wore their beret and hackle and thought they were representing their old regiment. We have no idea what he did with this money, or how much it came to. Jack Rigby has not seen any of it.”The jury heard that Gardner, who denies three counts of fraud, became very aggressive when he was quizzed about the cash by fellow organisers of the truck-pull event. Karl Jenkins, a member of the Medbourne Village Hall Committee, said: The whole process of asking questions and trying to get answers out of him was just impossible.Everywhere you drove in the area there was a poster for this truck-pull. We could not do anything but let it go ahead. I wasnt satisfied at all. In fact I was very uncomfortable about the whole situation. I was sickened to the stomach because I had no idea how much had been raised or where it had gone.After the first event Gardner publicly showed a giant charity cheque made out to the Jack Rigby trust for £3,000 but no cash was handed over, the court heard. It was claimed that villagers offered to help count the cash but he refused.Lee was killed by Islamic extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.The trial continues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says we can leave in a safe and orderly manner through the Chequers plan or we can leave dangerously and chaotically if we don’t agree a departure deal with Europe.In truth, there are other choices. We could surrender less sovereignty by proposing a conventional trade agreement, as Davis suggested in a white paper that was rejected by the PM.But his proposal was never published, and Davis is now on the backbenches.We could join the European Economic Area, like Norway, leaving us subject to European laws, including free movement, and paying into the Brussels budget.Advocates, including the Tory MP Nick Boles, say this would buy us time to sort out our long-term relationship with Europe, but we would risk getting stuck half-in, half-out of the EU for years.Whatever the merits of his case, however, Boles is a backbench MP who cannot impose policy on the Government.Because Theresa May is the Prime Minister, Chequers is the only policy on the table. But Chequers, as bad as it already is, will not be the final deal.Downing Street insiders insist it is “obtainable” without further compromises, while the PM says she will not accept compromises “that are not in our national interest”. But this is the problem: There will be further compromises, which come on top of an already flawed proposal.And this is hardly a surprise, because Chequers is unacceptable to the Europeans.The EU’s number one rule is that the “four freedoms” of its single market — in goods, services, people and capital — cannot be divided.And yet Chequers — as unacceptable as it is to British Eurosceptics — seeks to divide these four freedoms.Britain is effectively asking to stay in the single market for trade in goods but not in services, people and capital.If we want what we have proposed for goods, the Europeans will say we must accept the other obligations.As part of an agreement about services, they will insist on Britain accepting more EU laws and a greater role for the European Court.They are likely to demand financial contributions and access to British waters for their fishing industry.And while they might not call it free movement, they will insist on concessions that grant Europeans almost automatic access to the British labour market.This prediction is not plucked out of thin air. It is based on decades of EU policymaking, and everything European leaders and their negotiators have said since the referendum.It is reflected in the EU’s own negotiating guidelines, issued to the European Commission by the Council of Ministers.And it is why, in her Lancaster House speech last year, Theresa May ruled out single market membership.Having to accept its obligations, she said, “would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all”.And yet this is the danger we now face. According to several Government sources, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is “itching” to make a “generous offer” on immigration. Some believe he wants to retain free movement rules, because he says we cannot get a good trade deal unless we do so.Theresa May, on the other hand, is adamant that free movement must end.But whether or not we are legally part of EU free movement rules, the question is whether her deal will regain full control of immigration to Britain. And what we know already is alarming.There is nothing wrong with allowing tourists to come here easily, students to attend British universities and business people to travel without bureaucracy.Nor is there a problem with firms moving their workers across borders quickly and easily to provide services.And it makes sense to give Europeans preferential access to Britain compared to people from further away.But few ministers care about reducing immigration, and the Chequers white paper is remarkably open about the options. It proposes, for example, a “youth mobility scheme” that would give young Europeans the right to live and work in Britain for fixed periods.Without strict limits, this alone could destroy meaningful immigration control, because most people who want to migrate are young.Around 64 per cent of EU migrants to Britain are under 30, while 86 per cent are younger than 40.The white paper suggests “other specific mobility areas”, without giving further details. It proposes “social security coordination” which might allow migrants to claim benefits for children living back home in countries like Poland.And it says nothing about our ability to deport or bar European criminals from Britain.Most worryingly, there is no proposal for a visa system for European workers.Without that, unskilled and low-skilled immigration will continue without limit.It does not need to be like this.We are discussing these unacceptable compromises because Chequers proposes partial membership of the EU’s single market.If we want to escape Europe’s laws, its court and its demands for our money — and if we want to control immigration — the Government needs to revive its plans for a free trade agreement, and it needs to do so urgently.Unless it does, Brexit will not mean Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

let remaining two survive speaks of joy as all four start school","story":"Grace Slattery, 35, from County Limerick in Ireland, was offered an abortion for two of her children as doctors considered them to be high risk.But after already losing four babies she couldn’t bear to terminate another two and refused to listen to doctors’ advice, given when she was 17 weeks pregnant.Now the 35-year-old has spoken of her delight after her four healthy children are about to start school.After three years of struggling with infertility, Grace and her husband, James, 37, were dumbfounded when they discovered theyd naturally conceived quads.Grace managed to carry the quads until she was 32 weeks pregnant and Amelia, Lily-Grace, Mollie and Lucas were all born weighing between 2lbs and 4lbs.And despite Amelia being born with her organs in the wrong place, she is now as healthy as the other three.The odds of conceiving quads without fertility treatment is one in 700,000.The inseparable quads now cant wait to start pre-school and are ready to go with their matching uniforms.Grace said: They are definitely little miracles and we still cant believe we got four babies all at once.All of them love school and as they wear a uniform now it makes it a lot easier as trying to think of four outfits for them every day takes a long time.They are going to be in the same classes at school and they are inseparable when together.She said: I couldnt be more proud of the quadruplets and seeing them in their school uniforms is amazing.When I fell pregnant naturally with quadruplets I couldnt believe it as we had struggled for three years and Id suffered four miscarriages.We couldnt afford IVF and when tests showed nothing was wrong I was baffled as to why we couldnt have children, the mother-of-four said.I was over the moon when the quadruplets were born in May 2014, and despite being offered to abort two of them before they were even born as they were classed as high risk, we decided to let fate decide.Grace told how each of the children have their individual quirks, with Lucas being slightly more reserved than his sisters.She said: Life is hectic with quadruplets but we wouldnt change it for the world even though it had made us realise that our family is now complete.The parents are now preparing for school life and have bought 10 school uniforms to ensure the children have enough to last them each week.Grace added: I will miss them when they go back to school but it will be nice to get some peace and quiet after the summer.The school run will be fun as its almost impossible to keep my eye on all four but the quadruplets love making new friends so I know theyll love it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004294003441-e1536014506129.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm boris theresa chequers tory","story":"Downing Street aides are on full alert to repel an imminent leadership challenge on the PM by hard Brexiteers.The PM ordered aides to savage her former Foreign Secretary for branding her Chequers plan for a deal “a disaster” and “a fix” in his newspaper column yesterday.In No10’s most direct attack on the Tory big beast so far, the PM’s official spokesman accused Boris of “no new ideas” and strongly suggested that he wasn’t a serious politician.The spokesman declared: “What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that’s exactly what the country has with this Prime Minister and this Brexit plan”.The furious exchange of blows between the two top Tories lead to a fresh bout of Tory civil war yesterday as a series of other grandees publicly piled in.The Sun has learned that Mrs May has been told that a faction of hard Brexiteer Tory MPs are urging Boris to try to oust her now.They believe this month is their last chance to sink her Chequers plan as the template for talks between EU leaders in October, which will won’t deliver a clean Brexit.A Tory minister said: “No10 think Boris is being pushed to come for Theresa now.“They also don’t think he will succeed, as he’s a divisive character and doesn’t have anywhere near the number of MPs he needs yet.“But they are worried that may change quickly if things continue to look bad for Chequers.”One rebel Tory MP last night openly called for Mrs May to make way for a more committed Leaver.Andrew Bridgen told Channel 4 News : “I have always been of the view that you’ve got to believe in Brexit to deliver Brexit”.Senior Tories openly sparred with each other yesterday over the chances of the Chequers plan succeeding.Home Secretary Sajid Javid challenged Boris to put up a better plan than the PM’s or shut up, saying: “For those who think there’s a different way, they need to properly set out their alternative plan”.Another Mrs May loyalist, his predecessor Amber Rudd accused Boris of “once again leap before you look”, as well as repeating her referendum campaign jibe against him about not wanting the mop haired Tory to drive her home at night.But a passionate former Remainer senior Tory spoke out to also slam Chequers.Ex-Education Secretary Justine Greening said the plan is “more unpopular than the poll tax” and has ”no prospect” of ever getting through Parliament.GOT a story?

Good. Then let’s proceed, in an open-minded fashion, with X Factor, the focus group years, where there are some new faces on the panel.We’ve got Louis “lad” Tomlinson, who brings the experience of taking part in the show.Robbie Williams, who brings the ­experience of over 20 years in the music industry.And Ayda, who brings the ­experience of playing Angela Moroni in Days Of Our Lives.Ironically, though, the newest face of all probably belongs to Simon Cowell, whose head now requires constant fanning and is so curiously swollen they could shove it on a plinth in the FA Museum above a plaque that reads: “1923 Cup Final ­football.”What caused it to balloon, I cannot say for sure, but if it was done to divert attention from the other end of the judging panel, he’s seriously underestimated the attention-seeking and self-absorption of Robbie Williams, which is total.A factor not helped by the adoring presence of Ayda, whose public displays of affection for “Rob” could quickly become the X Factor’s most nauseating ever detail.Enormous as it is, there’s not much Simon’s head can do about the singing either.The problem here, of course, is that almost everyone who wants to audition for a karaoke show has now auditioned, or sung professionally.So we were swamped with re-treads on this weekend’s double-header.Among them were: Danny Tetley, who appeared on Pop Idol, Caribbean ­talent show ­veteran Olatunji Yearwood, who’s already got a record deal, Livin’ Joy’s Janice “Dreamer” Robinson, and Brendan ­Murray from Hometown, a Sony act who were managed by Louis Walsh. Not that anyone was admitting as much.If there was any joy and spontaneity to proceedings, though, it was generally ­provided by those random whack-nut contestants who don’t appear on Simon’s approved list.Acts like Livia and the Elementals, Aaron Denham, who looked like he’d absconded from Guantanamo Bay, and Andy Hofton, who performed a song called Castle Of Love that’s been 20 years in gestation and, to no tune at all, went like this.“All my life, I’ve been building a castle of love. That lifts me to your heart.“Here I am, I’ve built my castle of . . .”“Andy! ANDY!” Simon’s hand of objection went up. He was then asked if he had a second song. Angels kicked in and I think you know what happened next.If someone on the judging panel had their wits about them, obviously, they’d have waited for Andy and Robbie to finish their duet then said: “Actually, let’s try Castle Of Love again.”No chance of that, though, as Cowell set his stall out, day one, when he told Danny Tetley: “The music business should be more open-minded.”The irony of a show that’s spent 14 series steering viewers towards its preferred winner now demanding open-mindedness won’t be lost on anyone, but I think it’s just ­cosmetic.The sort of “let’s-pretend we’re-nice” ­cobblers political parties trot out when they’re in as much trouble as this show.It won’t work, though. ’Cos there were so many things the X Factor urgently needed to ditch — sob stories, manipulation, product-placement, deception, scripted “spontaneity” — yet it sounds like the only element it’s going to discard is the brutal and funny honesty which made it stand out from the competition.Show’s over, folks.Paul Merson: “The one person I feel sorry for is the Newcastle fans.”And Tony Cottee: “Hemed’s had two efforts, Freeman’s had two efforts and all three have been saved.”CELEBRITY Big Brother viewers finally got to see last week why the show paid £75,000 to book actress Roxanne Pallett, whose relationship with the truth could, at best, be described as flexible.Unwitting victim was Corrie’s Ryan Thomas, who engaged her with a spot of the house craze for shadow boxing on Thursday’s show, which everyone could see was entirely playful.Having initially laughed it off, though, Roxanne suddenly decided it was “an assault” and he was “a woman beater”, who had to be removed.It made a mockery of the real thing, obviously, and would have ruined Ryan’s life if there’d been a hint of doubt about the video footage.In the kangaroo court atmosphere of the #MeToo movement, however, and with a £75,000 investment to protect, Channel 5 had to indulge her fantasies and give Ryan an official warning for his “behaviour”.She’s since fled the house, of course, without her fee, and apologised.If anyone’s missing Roxanne’s histrionics, though, there’ll soon be another chance to see the dingbat lose her s**t on Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where her stay comes to a tearful climax over the camp fire which, apparently, sparks fevered memories of a teenage house inferno that could’ve killed her entire family. But didn’t.It’s a pattern likely to continue as well.Given the fact then that reality television clearly causes Roxanne Pallett such huge emotional distress and painful memory spasms, it’s probably best if neither she nor the toxic show that booked her ever troubles us again.BBC2’s Eight Go Rallying, in ­CambodiaBBC1’s Bodyguard is a curse, a liability, a Jonah. Norman bloody Wisdom in a bullet-proof vest.He sits on a train, ­suicide bombers appear in the next carriage.He gets in a car with the Home Secretary, a sniper’s killed Terry the driver.He turns up to see her speak?

hope for worlds rarest big cats could be safe from extinction","story":"The male and female lion cubs were born in South Africa last week and mark the first time a successful pregnancy has been achieved through artificial insemination.A research team at the University of Pretoria pioneered the research of in-vitro fertilisation in which the harvested sperm of a male lion was placed inside the lioness to impregnate her.Just three and a half months later, the lioness gave birth to the two healthy cubs named Viktor and Isabel at Ukutulu Game Reserve \u0026amp Conservation Centre.The South African study examined artificial insemination protocols for the female African lion but the scientific breakthrough may lead to the successful IVF breeding of endangered big cats in the future to help animals like the tiger, snow leopard and Iberian lynx beat extinction.Professor Andre Ganswindt of the University of Pretoria Mammal Research Institute said: There are tremendous threats to wildlife due to the loss of habitat and anthropogenic pressures which also affect big cats.He continued: That is why a number of species are listed as vulnerable or endangered but this research could combat the threat of extinction facing several types of big cat around the world.Professor Ganswindt added that the research was carried out as a pre-emptive measure as, in order to stabilise populations of endangered animals, the techniques must be developed on a stable population, such as lions in South Africa.The project’s main researcher Dr Isabel Callealta said: “This was a world first for lions and the idea is to improve our knowledge and understanding of the big cats and move the research quickly forward.She continued: “The research will hopefully mean we can start working towards carrying out similar procedures on some of the much rarer big cats like the snow leopard and the tiger in the future”.The owner of Ukutulu Game Reserve \u0026amp Conservation Centre Willi Jacobs, 60, said: They are both absolutely perfect cubs in every way and we decided to honour the researcher Isabel by naming the female cub after her and the male cub after her fiancé Victor.“When they are big enough they will be introduced to the other lions but meanwhile they are happy and healthy and playful and leading us a merry dance.Ukutula, in conjunction with University of Pretoria and international researchers, established the conservation centre, laboratory and biobank at the beginning of 2017 for scientific research.There are thought to be less than 4000 tigers left in the wild in Asia and less than 7000 snow leopards in the mountains of Central Asia and as few as 300 Iberian Lynx in Spain.In Africa there are 18,000 lions left in the wild thanks to successful conservation and breeding."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-chicken-egg_4410925.jpg?20180904090259 ","title":"former nfl star colin kaepernick fronts nike just do it advertising

The study shows that since the 2016 referendum 1.6million people who backed Leave have moved to the Remain camp. The vast majority of these - 1.4million - are Labour supporters especially in the north east and north west of England. But this is offset by a hardening of attitudes among Tory voters, with 800,000 Conservatives who backed Remain now saying they would vote Leave. The findings are based on an analysis of YouGov polls of 15,000 people by the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign and Hope Not Hate.  It finds a major shift in views among Labour voters in the party’s traditional heartlands with seats such as Wigan, Middlesbrough, Barnsley Central and Bolton South East moving towards Remain. In Burnley 33% backed Remain at the referendum but 45% would now do so, while in Barnsley Central 31% voted Remain but that has leapt to 49% and in Middlesbrough the number backing Remain has gone from 34% 47%. It is a similar story in Washington \u0026amp Sunderland West where support for Remain has risen from 38% to 49% and Ashton-under-Lyne where it has risen from 38% to 47.6%.  Best for Britain says since the 2016 referendum 112 parliamentary seats that voted Leave would now back remain, with the majority of them  held by Labour. According to its analysis a further 71 further seats that are likely to switch to Remain in the near future. Labour MP Owen Smith said the findings showed why Jeremy Corbyn should back a second referendum. He said: “This new data confirms that Britain is changing its mind about Brexit and Labour voters are leading the change.  “They want to see an end to austerity and they are worried that Brexit will mean years more of cuts to the NHS and other public services. “If Jeremy Corbyn wants to be Prime Minister and to rebuild those public services he needs to win those voters by delivering a vote on the final deal and a chance for the country change course on Brexit.” So far the Labour leadership has refused to endorse a referendum on the final Brexit deal but has said the option remains on the table. According to the survey, 56% of Labour voters wanted a second poll, with 32% opposed. The poll also found middle aged voters are most likely to have changed their mind on Brexit, with 32% of 25 to 34 year-olds moving from Leave to Remain and 23.7% of 35 to 44 year-olds. By contrast only 2.8 of those aged 65 and over have altered their opinion on Brexit. The findings also spell potential trouble for Tory Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab. In Mr Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency in London only 14% backed a no deal Brexit with 49% opposed and 74% said they did not know how complicated Brexit would be. In Mr Raab’s Esher and Walton seat 58% back Remain, with 73% saying Brexit gets in the way of the real issues facing the country.

Kate James, 20, gave birth to Thomas four weeks ago, just over three months after losing a bitter court battle to keep 23-month-old Alfie alive. And she says the new arrival looks exactly like her beloved firstborn. Cradling the sleeping infant yesterday, she said: “He’s amazing, he’s the absolute double of Alfie. “When I wake up to feed him in the morning and he does that stretch, sometimes I feel Alfie is in him.”  The mum suffered sleepless nights in the days after Thomas was born, fearing he could have the same degenerative brain disease that killed his brother. Doctors warned her and her boyfriend Tom Evans that there was a 25% chance he might suffer the same condition, which was not definitively diagnosed until after Alfie’s death on April 28. Now it has been identified as GABA-transaminase deficiency, a disorder so rare it has been diagnosed only 10 times – but any child of Kate and Tom’s has a high chance of being born with it. Kate said: “They explained to us that they had found two faulty genes. One comes from me and one comes from Tom. “Only 10 children in the world have had [the \u0026shycondition]. Five have passed, five are still alive. “Me and Tom have a one-in-four chance of it happening to more babies. I knew there was a chance that Thomas could have it.”  After his birth last month, the couple from Liverpool suffered an agonising four days as doctors conducted a series of tests. Kate told ITV’s This Morning yesterday: “We couldn’t sleep. When I had him, that’s when it kicked in. Everything he would do, I was like: ‘Oh my God, he’s got it, he’s got it’.” Tom added: “They were the most nerve-racking days.” But finally the couple were given the good news that Thomas was in the clear. It means they can finally sleep peacefully after a traumatic two years dominated by their fight for Alfie’s life. In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror earlier this year, Kate had told of the pain she felt when doctors said nothing could be done to save Alfie. She said: “You can feel it all over. Your body aches, it comes from all over.” Kate said Alfie was the “best thing in the world” to happen to the couple when he was born in May 2016. “Alfie was a shock because we weren’t trying for a baby,” she said. “He was absolutely gorgeous, he was a dream – the perfect baby. He had the funniest laugh. Tummy giggles right from the get-go. He was just a loving boy, he was so content.”  But the couple started having concerns about him when they noticed he was not progressing as normal. Kate said: “He wasn’t reaching his milestones – sitting up, hand-eye \u0026shyco-ordination. He wasn’t babbling much and his swallowing reflex wasn’t good. At the age of seven months he was still on puree, like three-month baby food. Kate took him to her GP three times but was told there was little to worry about. But she knew things were not right and asked her health visitor to speak to the doctor. In November 2016 medics agreed to see Alfie and he had an MRI scan. Weeks later he fell seriously ill and was rushed to Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool, where he stayed until his death over a year later.  Doctors at the hospital said there was nothing more they could do and it was in his best interests to let him slip away. They won a court’s permission to withdraw his life support, prompting Tom and Kate to begin their long and heartbreaking battle to overturn the decision. The couple appealed to judges both in the UK and Europe to help them, and Tom even travelled to the Vatican to enlist the support of the Pope. But it was all to no avail and Alfie’s life support was switched off and he died five days later. The couple are now launching a charity in Alfie’s name to support other sick children like him. During the legal proceedings Kate discovered she was carrying their second child. And she admitted yesterday that her initial reaction to her new pregnancy was “bitter sweet”.

Gary Gardner invited the murdered soldier’s widow Rebecca and son Jack to be guests of honour at truck-pull fundraisers. He allegedly vowed to raise enough to set Jack “up for life” with high-profile events, including one at which ex-Fusiliers went round with tins collecting from crowds. A jury heard he did raise at least \u0026pound24,000 – but that none was ever given to Jack or his trust fund.  Instead, prosecutors claimed, Gardner spent cash on a music single in a bid to be a top producer, paid off his overdraft and blew more on expenses. Samuel Skinner, prosecuting, told Leicester crown court: “The defendant declared publicly that he donated \u0026pound3,000 to Jack Rigby. That was untrue.” Rebecca, 34, told jurors that neither she nor Jack, now eight, “ever received a penny” from Gardner and that he finally stopped answering calls or emails.

Police have been forced to apply to the US Department of Justice for a court order after the social media site failed to provide information relating to Stephen Nicholson\u0027s account. Grieving mum Stacey White accused the tech giant of denying her justice for her 13-year-old daughter. The 30-year-old told the Daily Mail: In situations like this, Facebook really should just release the information that is needed and I think that is the opinion that everybody has. They should give over the account details. Lucy needs justice. It’s so easy for them to do.  Schoolgirl Lucy was found stabbed to death in woodland at Southampton Sports Centre on July 26. Suspect Nicholson denied detectives access to his Facebook account - even though he admitted he had been in contact with Lucy before her death. The 24-year-old tattoo artist was jailed for 14 months on Friday for failing to cooperate with police. Prosecutor Matthew Lawson told the court: The result of [his refusal] is that police are now having to make enquiries with Facebook themselves. These enquiries present a difficulty to them. The police have to go through a lengthy procedure.  The police investigation has been considerably obstructed by the defendant\u0027s failure to comply. A spokesman for Hampshire Police confirmed they had exhausted all options through the British legal system to get access to Nicholson\u0027s account. He said: There is no further legislation available to assist with this matter. We are continuing to follow the process of requesting access from Facebook which is lengthy and involves an international application through the US Department of Justice.  Nicholson admitted to the charge of failing to cooperate with police, which falls under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act , when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court via video link on Friday. The care worker was staying in Lucy\u0027s family home in Southampton until several days before her death and had contact with her as recently as the morning of her disappearance, the prosecution said.

Emma Standish’s organs are failing due to damage caused by immunosuppressants taken to stop the body attacking the donor heart. The 27-year-old said apart from her kidneys she is in good health. “My heart is fabulous – they found the perfect heart,” she said. “People are shocked when they find out about my transplant as I’m just a normal girl.” Emma, from Bolton, was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, which is believed to be triggered by an infection, at the age of nine. She became poorly over a year as her heart muscle stretched and it could not beat properly.  She had been given just 72 hours to live when she was rushed 150 miles from the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital to Newcastle Freeman Hospital to be fitted with a mechanical heart. But word came through on the journey that a suitable donor had been found. Since surgery she has lived a normal life and had children – Ava, seven, and Harrison, three – with partner Wayne. She said: “I think my parents didn’t tell me much about what was going on to protect me because I was still so young. “The doctors told my parents that if I didn’t get a heart transplant I was going to die. I had no idea what was going to happen and I was so poorly I just wanted to give up fighting.” Emma, who works at Royal Bolton Hospital, supports our Change the Law for Life campaign calling for organ donation to be opt-out unless relatives object.

The move was unveiled by lottery operator Camelot, but is dependent on government approval. Cash totalling \u0027thousands of pounds\u0027, will be paid every month to winners for at least 25 years, Lottery bosses say. They believe offering players long-term financial security rather than a one-off, huge jackpot, will appeal to a new audience. It is part of a string of measures introduced amid falling ticket sales.  In a statement, Camelot said: Subject to regulatory approval, Camelot will launch a brand new annuity game in the spring of 2019, which is expected to have a top prize of thousands of pounds every month for at least 25 years. It said it has carried out research in countries where similar games are played. The statement continued: Subject to approval from its regulator, Camelot is currently finalising details for a brand new annuity game, which is expected to launch in the spring of 2019 and which will offer a regular, fixed amount of money for a set number of years.  As part of its extensive research, Camelot has been closely examining what is done in other countries where this type of game is hugely popular. Annuity games appeal to people who dream of lifelong financial security, rather than just big, one-off jackpots – so this will be an entirely new proposition to round off The National Lottery portfolio.  It said the exact prizes and the cost of a ticket have yet to be decided. The statement continued: As the game isn’t due to launch until next year, the prizes on offer or the cost of play have not yet been finalised – but the early indication is that the top prize will be thousands of pounds every month for at least 25 years. Camelot will provide an update as soon as possible – and in line with the normal processes in the lead-up to the launch of a new game. Overhauls of Lotto and Euromillions will also aim to create more millionaires. From November, the Millionaire Raffle will be scrapped and instead \u0026pound1million will be handed to players who match five winning numbers and the bonus ball. Until now this combination – with a one in seven million chance – has only scooped \u0026pound50,000. Winnings also rise from \u0026pound1,000 to \u0026pound1,750 for five numbers, while four get \u0026pound140 instead of \u0026pound100.

A devastating photo of Jake Schofield has been shared showing his bruised and blood-splattered face in a bid to track down his attackers. The call centre worker, 21, had been enjoying a night out in Manchester with older brother Nathan. But things took a nasty turn when he was repeatedly kicked in the head by two men during the vicious attack in the early hours of Sunday.  Jake and Nathan were walking home with a mate when they saw two men relieving themselves, the Manchester Evening News reports.  But when Nathan, 27, asked them to stop, the men, thought to be in their 40s, began attacking them, Nathan was kicked to the floor, while their friend suffered a broken nose after he was punched in the face.  The men, who were also accompanied by a male in his late teens or early 20s, then turned their attentions to Jake. He was punched to the floor and kicked unconscious in a terrifying assault. As Jake lay in a pool of blood just yards from his home in Turf Lane, Chadderton, the men then got in a car driven by a woman and fled the scene. Luckily a neighbour heard the commotion, saw Jake on the floor and called 999. Police and paramedics were on the scene within minutes and Jake was taken to Salford Royal Hospital where was found to have suffered a fractured skull, cheekbone, nose and hand. Jake’s sister Zoe, 25, said her brother, who had been on a night out in Manchester and had been dropped off by a taxi at the end of the street, is lucky to be alive.

The storm, currently near the US, may be about to bring dramatic changes to the current humid temperatures with spells of very wet and windy weather for Western Europe.  Florence is this year\u0027s latest tropical storm and is moving in a north-northwesterly direction towards the US East Coast. However, there are a number of signs that it could strengthen into a hurricane next week as it travels over warmer waters - a key factor in intensifying storms.  Dr. Claire Kennedy-Edwards, senior meteorologist of The Weather Channel, said Florence is expected to re-curve across the northern Atlantic, turn extra-tropical and transition into a mid-latitude low. She said: Some forecast models are favouring a more westward track for Tropical Storm Florence, which could impact north-eastern areas of the US. However, others show the storm re-curving around the subtropical ridge as the remnants of Florence get entrained into the jet stream. Latest model runs show a iety of downstream effects for western Europe.  There is a risk that western parts of Europe could become very unsettled in the coming weeks. Potent remnants of Florence could be absorbed by the jet stream and be pushed towards western parts of the near continent - including Britain - around mid-September. The latest outlook for autumn in the UK shows three months of above average temperatures, with largely dry and bright conditions. However, Amy Hodgson, forecaster of The Weather Channel, said as the Atlantic hurricane season begins to reach its peak, this could change thanks to spells of unsettled, stormy weather. She said there is a risk of low pressure edging in across western Europe over the next 11-15 days.

His abstract work, combined with his avant-garde ballet productions were said to have influenced the music icon\u0027s Ziggy Stardust stage show. But he was also an artist of great renown with his painting Idealistic Encounter from 1928 was sold for 1.487million  at Sotheby\u0027s in New York.  Who was Oskar Schlemmer? Oskar Schlemmer was born in Stuttgart in 1888. Having studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule  in Stuttgart and the city\u0027s Academy of Fine Arts he eventually became a master student of abstract artist Adolf Holzel. Under his mentor, Schlemmer learnt to abandon the style promoted by the Impressionists and instead turned to the Cubists for inspiration. He was fascinated with their ideas of form and composition and the tensions between them.  Schlemmer was wounded in action during World War II but returned to Stuttgart in 1916.  In 1920, Schlemmer went to work as a teacher at the Bauhaus where he remained for nine years. His complex ideas were influential, making him one of the most important teachers working at the school at that time. But, with the rise of the Nazis at the end of the Twenties, Schlemmer\u0027s work was seen as degenerate and he was dismissed from his post.  The last decade of Schlemmer\u0027s life was marred by the dictatorship and defamation of his life\u0027s work. But he continued to exhibit his work when possible and participated in major exhibitions in London and New York in 1938.  Schlemmer was reunited with Baumeister and other artists in 1940 when he moved to Wuppertal where he earned a living by working at a factory.  He died of a heart attack three years later.   What was Oskar Schlemmer famous for? Schelmmer was famous for art his complex and challenging approach to art - even for the progressive Bauhaus movement.  His work was widely exhibited in both Germany and outside the country.  It was a rejection of pure abstraction, instead retaining a sense of the human, though not in the emotional sense but in view of the physical structure of the human.  He represented bodies as architectural forms, reducing the figure to a rhythmic play between convex, concave and flat surfaces.  And not just of its form, he was fascinated by every movement the body could make trying to capture it in his work.  As well as leaving a large body of work behind, Schlemmer art theories have also been published.

Ian Wilson believes remains of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, which vanished carrying 239 people en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing , lie strewn deep in a jungle in Cambodia. The video producer now plans to visit the dense terrain to prove his chilling theory. He said: Measuring the Google sighting, you\u0027re looking at around 69 metres, but there looks to be a gap between the tail and the back of the plane. It\u0027s just slightly bigger, but there\u0027s a gap that would probably account for that.    The ill-fated plane flight took off from the Malaysian capital on March 8, 2014, with 227 passengers on board and 12 crew. But it disappeared during a handover between Malaysian and Vietnamese air-traffic controllers with the transponder shut down. Mr Wilson told Daily Star Online : I was on there [Google Earth], a few hours here, a few hours there. If you added it up I spent hours searching for places a plane could have gone down.

Antonia told the Mirror: The neighbours and I have always got on. We keep parcels for each other, chat on occasion. Part of the fence had been blown down a while ago... The neighbour knocked on the door and asked if it was OK if he fixed the fence for me as he had a few friends round and they had the tools to do the job properly.

Her doctor and lover, Andreas David Niederbichler, 42, has been arrested and is accused of putting the drug on his penis without her knowledge.

There were clear parameters about what we would be discussing and what we would not. In fact, the exact question the interviewer asked first, she had put to me when we met the day prior. I said that was off limits. When she asked me it on stage, with blatant disregard for our agreement, it became clear to me I had been misled.

With medics saying she was at risk of a fourth miscarriage, she was advised to abort two of the four in order to give the others a chance. But she decided to ignore doctors\u0027 advice, given when she was 17 weeks pregnant. Now the 35-year-old has spoken of her delight after her four healthy children are about to start school. After three years of struggling with infertility, Grace and her husband, James, 37, were dumbfounded when they discovered they\u0027d naturally conceived quads.  Grace managed to carry the quads until she was 32 weeks pregnant and Amelia, Lily-Grace, Mollie and Lucas were all born weighing between 2lbs and 4lbs. And despite Amelia being born with her organs in the wrong place, she is now as healthy as the other three.  The inseparable quads now can\u0027t wait to start pre-school and are finally set with their matching uniforms. Grace, from County Limerick, Ireland, said: I couldn\u0027t be more proud of the quadruplets and seeing them in their school uniforms is amazing. When I fell pregnant naturally with quadruplets I couldn\u0027t believe it as we had struggled for three years and I\u0027d suffered four miscarriages.  We couldn\u0027t afford IVF and when tests showed nothing was wrong I was baffled as to why we couldn\u0027t have children. I was over the moon when the quadruplets were born in May 2014, and despite being offered to abort two of them before they were even born as they were classed as high risk, we decided to let fate decide. They are definitely little miracles and we still can\u0027t believe we got four babies all at once. All of them love school and as they wear a uniform now it makes it a lot easier as trying to think of four outfits for them every day takes a long time.  They are going to be in the same classes at school and they are inseparable when together. It\u0027s so cute seeing them with their matching lunch boxes, shoes and backpacks. Grace has decided to buy 10 school uniforms to ensure Amelia, Lily-Grace, Mollie and Lucas have enough to last them each week. She added: Their uniforms are comfy and there\u0027s no getting them out of them once they\u0027re on, they love wearing sunglasses too which is adorable. Life is hectic with quadruplets but we wouldn\u0027t change it for the world even though it had made us realise that our family is now complete.

What do they do each day and how do they feel about their area?In the first of an eight-part series, we aim to paint an up-to-date picture of how the city’s people live, based on the results of a new survey.Dundee’s most recent citizens’ survey was carried out last year and local area results are now available. Today Jon Brady and James Simpson look at the West End, where locals were asked about their lifestyles.Stretching from Perth Road all the way out to Ninewells, the West End is a ied area with a diverse population – mostly Scottish, but with a relatively large Polish population, and a mix of all ages.And if there’s one thing to be said about West Enders, it’s that they like where they live: 89% said they would rate the area as a “very good” place to live.Almost three quarters of those asked said that they could find nothing to fault about the area. Generally long-term residents, more than half of those living in the West End have been there for more than three years, and say they have seen the area improve.That said, 53% of those asked say people have become less friendly, and the other 47% think there are too many private lets – unsurprising for Dundee’s student quarter.Generally, West Enders are happy with the range of amenities they have open to them, from playparks to shopping.However, a third of those asked said the streets could be cleaner. A typical West Ender gets about by bus – with two-thirds of locals catching a bus at least once a week.And they like to keep fit too: 69% take part in organised sports at least once a week.Nearly nine in 10 people say they are in “good” or “very good” health and 84% don’t smoke. Almost all residents are registered with a doctor, and 88% go to the dentist.Of those who took part in the survey, 23% either agreed or strongly agreed that they could influence decisions affecting the area, while 7% either disagreed or strongly disagreed.Despite fears that people are less friendly, most folk living in the West End believe they can turn to friends for support in times of need.The West End is seen by its residents as a “very safe” or “fairly safe”, with levels of crime staying the same.Most people are balancing their books, and the relative majority also believe the council provides a good service.Adam Cupples, 26, has lived in the West End for the last four years. He said: “There are plenty of bars and shops right on your doorstep.“I lived in the area while I was studying at Abertay. I now plan on staying here for the foreseeable future.”Ian Smith, 70, a part-time tutor, added: “There is a good mix of ages living in the area.”Jen Coling, 23, has lived in the West End ward for three years. She said: “I like the fact Magdalen Green is so close to my home.”Former Harris Academy pupil and West End resident Jacqui King, 48, said she was “surprised” to hear people had become less friendly: “I’ve grown up in the area and generally you’ll see the same faces. I love students but there are too many HMOs in the area.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens alloa athletic v dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPaul Watson gets his third in two games but an Iain Flannigan free-kick means Dundee United lie fourth in the Championship.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8d173694047-e1535990769599.jpg ","title":"dundee and angus college students face daily 5 parking charge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCollege students could be facing a parking “nightmare” once new restrictions come into force. 100vw, 3000px\" /The Dundee and Angus College campus off Kingsway is set to lose free access to more than 100 parking spaces in the next few days.Students looking to park in spaces owned by SoccerWorld and Ryze trampoline park at Old Glamis Road will now need to fork out £5 a day for the privilege.An operational decision by the businesses was taken to ensure the spaces were kept for customers during the day.Over the last 10 years, the college has paid SoccerWorld to use the area as an overflow car park.But the imminent opening of Ryze has led to electric and manual barriers being installed to stop students parking for free.Visitors to the activity centres will not be charged to enter the secured parking area, which will only be in operation during the day.Customers will be issued with a token to get in and out of the secured area free of charge.Liam Richardson, 24, who is studying at Dundee and Angus College, said that the additional spaces had been well-used by students.He said: “I found out when I was picking up my college ID that the car park had been blocked off.“I’m at college usually four times a week and I wouldn’t be prepared to pay £5 a day.”The horticulture student, who lives in St Mary’s, added: “To go from paying nothing to £5 is quite a big increase.

If fracking is too dirty and dangerous for us here in Scotland, we shouldn’t be trying to profit from it taking place in other countries either.”Stephen Smellie, deputy convener of Unison Scotland, said: “There are other, better ways to invest our pension funds and councils should be living up to their climate change obligations.”About £135m of the Tayside Pension Fund’s money is invested in firms such as BP and Shell, who carry out fracking across the globe.In all, it accounts for just 3.9% of the £3.4bn fund – meaning cash could likely be invested elsewhere without denting the fund’s worth.FotE claims the companies’ work threatens water resources in Africa and also agricultural land.A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “The Tayside Pension Fund has a legal and financial duty to act in the best interests of its members and beneficiaries, in line with guidance from the National Scheme Advisory Board.“The fund does not undertake any direct investment, but engages a number of external investment managers to make specialist investment decisions on its behalf, investing in order to fulfil the fiduciary responsibilities to members and employers, not to further ethical or political aims.“The fund’s current ESG policy is in keeping with the principles of the UNPRI and with the legal advice and opinion

moved to Dundee in 2002 and lives on Victoria Dock.She said: “I really want to raise awareness that people need to get a scan.“Some people don’t believe in braving the shave.“They feel it’s offensive to cancer patients who have lost their hair through treatment.“I’d like to make it clear that it’s not about trying to mimic or emphasise what someone diagnosed with cancer goes through.“The challenge is simply trying to raise funds and awareness, and for me it also helped with my grief by physically cutting away my hair.“I can finally say goodbye to my mum.”Suzie added: “It’s a physical release of some kind for me as it is for many others like me.“That isn’t easy but it is necessary.“There are developments in cancer research every day but for my family and hundreds like us it’s too late because of the lack of early detection.”Bernie remained in Ireland when Suzie made the move to the City of Discovery.Suzie added: “From the moment I got to Dundee, I loved it here.“I moved back home for a bit

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents.

For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:35

That is how it played out.“Steve is one of the game’s good guys but when I saw his phone ringing me when we finished training on Friday morning it was never really going to be anything that would be welcomed by us at that late stage.“How can you replace McKenna with five or six hours to go in a transfer window?“The figure that they offered wasn’t enough anyway but certainly the timing was the biggest factor in all of it.“We picked up an injury to Tommie Hoban and with Mark Reynolds out it is in not an area where we would have a lot of options.“So we wanted to have enough time to try to address that if the offer had been significant enough for us to accept it.“And it wasn’t.”McInnes was frustrated at the decision to dismiss Devlin just five minutes into the game and refused to rule out an appeal.He was also disappointed that referee Craig Thomson awarded a free-kick that Kilmarnock netted the opener from.He said: “We will look at maybe appealing that if it is going to be worthwhile.“But sometimes these things aren’t worthwhile.“I feel disappointed with some of the decisions.“It is tough when you go down to 10 men so early on.“Rightly or wrongly, whether he has deemed that as the last man going through, that is debatable to say the least.“We feel really aggrieved by the build-up to their first goal.“It was actually the player’s bad control on his own arm and the momentum pushed it forward in his own path and he got that side of my full-back Max Lowe.“That should have been deemed a hand ball.“My first thought was Graeme Shinnie had won the ball when Craig Thomson blew for the free-kick.“Brophy scored a fantastic goal over the wall which is well executed but there is a clear handball in the build-up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lewis confident dons have time to make up any lost ground","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlready trailing league leaders Hearts by seven points and four behind Celtic – but Joe Lewis insists there is no concern about the league start.For the Dons keeper the Premiership race is a marathon, not a sprint, which is why he is confident there is ample time to make up early lost ground.Aberdeen suffered a first domestic defeat of the season when going down 2-0 to Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.Following a red card to defender Mikey Devlin, the Dons were forced to play a man down for 86 minutes against Killie.However, the damage has been done with a first defeat in 19 league meetings to Kilmarnock costly as the Reds dropped to eighth in the table.When asked if there was any concern about the early league position, Lewis, 30, said: “No. It is only four games in.“We have 38 games this season so there are 34 games to make up seven points, which we are confident we can do.”There have been mitigating circumstances for the Reds’ slow start as boss Derek McInnes has had to negotiate a defensive crisis. At one point four of the six recognised first-team defenders were ruled out through suspension or injury.On-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban is set to undergo surgery on a shoulder injury and is expected to be sidelined for two to three months.Scotland international defender Scott McKenna has missed the last four games with a hamstring tear. He is set to return for the St Johnstone game after the international break.Centre-back Mark Reynolds is out until February having undergone knee surgery.Lewis said: “It has been frustrating with injuries and we also had Mikey Devlin sent off as well.“We have tried to make the best of a bad situation and hopefully the lads who have niggles can rest so we can come back stronger after the break.”Following the contentious dismissal, Devlin is also suspended for the next game. However, the Reds have appealed that red card.Referee Craig Thomson sent off the Dons defender as he deemed he was the last man and denied a clear scoring opportunity. However, Eamonn Brophy pulled Devlin’s shirt before the initial foul, which was 40 yards from goal on the right flank.The Reds were also denied a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Hibs and there was a hand- ball from Kilmarnock in the build-up to their opening goal on Saturday.However, Lewis refused to criticise the match officials.He said: “The referee made his decision and it is always a battle when you go down to 10 men against a Kilmarnock side who are very capable and will make the most of it.“It is a lot of work for the lads in midfield who have to cope with it. The free-kick was dubious as well.“But referees have a tough job and have to be everywhere sometimes.“For the handball in the lead-up the linesman was there and could maybe have helped the referee out a bit more.“From where I was it looked like a clear handball as he  has mis- controlled it as it hit his arm and bounced into his path.“It was frustrating.”Despite being a goal and a man down at half-time, Lewis insisted the Reds remained confident they could salvage a result.“We were still positive,” he said.“During the break, although we had just conceded and were a man down, the lads all felt we could get back in the game and get a draw or even a win.“We had to leave it with two v twos at the back which was going to leave us open to the counter-attack a little bit, which is a risk you have to take when you are pushing forward for a goal.“It  was great from Greg  point of view and once he got through on goal I felt I had all angles covered and he would just hit me.“But he showed great composure to dink it over me.“It was an excellent finish but going down to 10 men at the start of the game killed us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/sports.jpg ","title":"aberdeens the perfect playground for freshers articleisfree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor students just starting at one of Aberdeen’s colleges or universities it can be daunting trying to figure out where to eat, drink and exercise.If you don’t know where to go, or have people to point you in the right direction, you can be lost in a sea of possibility.There’s so much on offer.

I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of those at Amnesty International, both in the city and outwith, for the fantastic work they do.”The 73-year-old leader of Myanmar – formerly Burma – lived under house arrest for years for her pro-democracy activism and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.She has been accused of failing to speak out over violence against the Rohingya people in her role as state counsellor.Some 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the violence targeting them after attacks by Rohingya militants killed a dozen members of the security forces.Investigators working for the UN’s top human rights body said last week that genocide charges should be brought against senior Burma military officers over the crackdown.Last month Ms Suu Kyi had her Freedom of Edinburgh award revoked.Other cities including Glasgow, Newcastle and Oxford have also acted to strip her of similar honours.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious plans for new hotel in aberdeen city centre1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProposals have been launched to turn a vacant city centre office building into a new 106-bedroom hotel.Mandale Construction North has submitted plans to Aberdeen City Council that could see a hotel built at Custom House on Guild Street in Aberdeen.The firm is seeking planning permission from the local authority for a change of use from offices to a hotel.Planning permission has also been requested for outside alterations, as the building lies in a conservation area.Castlehill and Pittodrie Community Council has welcomed the proposals.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

I was glad the age limit had been lowered since I could enjoy the race with my dad.\u0026#8217John Hardie, the event organiser said: ‘With the guidance of British Cycling we managed to stage our event. As usual, the support from the people and businesses of Tarbert has been exemplary.\u0026#8216We wanted cyclists of all levels to enjoy the glorious cycle route 78, better known as the Kilberry Loop. It is a 40 mile cycle, not long for a sportive, but it is within the capability of most cyclists.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia. The objective of this expedition is to make real change to communities. The team will be installing clean water, building a play park and working in a rainforest eco-village. At the end of the expedition, the team will get the chance to enjoy the heritage and culture of this amazing country.The young people are involved in the planning and organisation of both expeditions. In addition, these young people from the 19th Argyll have committed to raising £10,000 \u0026#8211 30 per cent of the gross cost of their adventures \u0026#8211 during 2018/19.  To date £2,000 has been raised or committed with members of the team also securing part time employment to boost funds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strut your funky stuff","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/08/18, 1:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFord Line Dancers will soon be back strutting their stuff every Thursday.They will be back from August 30 in the newly-refurbished Ford Village Hall and welcome anyone, male or female, who is interested in joining.Line dancer Sue Grocock said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s a great way to exercise, and the beauty of this type of dance is that no partner is required neither is any dancing experience necessary as we will be going back to basics.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"action-promised-on-beach-eyesore","story":"  The sewage pipe on West Beach became visible for about 500 yards of the beach, one of the town\u0026rsquos most popular visitor attractions, as a result of the \u0026lsquoBeast from the East\u0026rsquo that plunged the county under snow for several days in March.  Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over.

The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

New details of the case have emerged showing how Lord Glennie in his judgment felt judges in two first tier tribunals  were predisposed to reject the men\u0027s claims of asylum having \"paid little attention\" to other evidence, particular witnesses from the Tron Church in Glasgow, of which the men, referred to only as TF and MA are members.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspAsylum-seeking Christian family fear death if forced to leave Glasgow after six years  He said the Tron witnesses gave \"admissible opinion evidence which is entitled to respect\".  Both the first tier and upper tribunals who rejected the appeals \"failed properly to take account of the independent evidence relating to the genuineness of the appellants\u0026rsquo conversions to Christianity. And they have failed to give adequate reasons for, in effect, disregarding such evidence.\"    Around 130-150 Iranians both asylum seekers and those who had already been granted asylum regularly attend mid-week meetings and Sunday services at the Tron.  The unidentified FTT judge in the case of TF had decided that he was claiming to be a Christian because it would assist him in his asylum claim in the UK.  He had identified \"major inconsistencies\" in his account of distribution anti-regime leaflets in Iran in 2013 before he came to the UK and rejected his claim that he had been arrested and tortured.  The judge went so far as conclude that a letter from a hospital relating to the man\u0027s treatment for physical injuries and sexual harm while in an Iranian prison were fabricated to improve his chances of asylum.  The judge found that TF, who entered the UK legally six years\u0026nbspago on a student visa, had been on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in 2013 undermining his claim that Islam did not play a role in his life.

I would therefore request that this application for permission to remain in the UK be granted so that he may continue to live a useful life in UK society.    The other asylum seeker MA entered the UK illegally in October, 2015 and initially claimed asylum because he was perceived to be a homosexual and at risk if returned, the Court of Session heard.  When the matter came to the FTT the claim was made on the basis of a conversion to Christianity which was not raised before Theresa May, then Home Secretary.  FTT judge took the view that the claim of conversion to Christianity was being kept \u0026ldquoin reserve as a \u0026ldquoPlan B, to be deployed if the initial claim based on perceived homosexual orientation should fail.  And the FTT judge called his claim a \"multi-layered contrivance\" adding: \"He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis.\"  The judge felt that a fabrication\u0026nbspof a story about an alleged homosexual encounter appeared to indicate that the appellant is \"someone who is prepared to contrive an account to suit his purposes\".  Four representatives from the Tron backed MA\u0027s asylum bid including Mr Taylor who again warned of persecution if returned to Iran.  But Lord Glennie said that in each case, the FTT, having formed a view on credibility adverse to the men \"appears to have paid little attention to the other evidence available to it, particularly the evidence from the witnesses from the Tron Church, accepting its honesty but giving it little or no weight.    \"It is wrong in principle to form a concluded view of the probable veracity of particular items of evidence and then, from that fixed point, to allow that view to govern the assessment of other evidence in the case. The proper approach is to adopt what is sometimes called an \u0027holistic\u0027 approach, considering all the evidence \u0027in the round\u0027 before arriving at any concluded view on the facts.  He added: \"The judge should not jump too readily to the conclusion that because the appellant has told lies about some matters then his credibility on all matters is fatally undermined.  \"Juries in a criminal trial are commonly directed that the fact that an individual may have lied about one point does not necessarily mean that he is lying about other matters, and the same words of caution should be taken to heart by tribunal judges hearing evidence in immigration and asylum appeals.  \"People have different reasons for not telling the truth, or the whole truth, about particular matters.  He said in the case of TF: \"[The FTT judge] says that he has \u0027looked at all the evidence in the round and taken into account my other findings herein before reaching my conclusions in respect of the appellant\u0026rsquos claimed conversion to Christianity\u0027. But when one looks at his reasons, he does no such thing.  \"What he ought to have done was to look at all the evidence in the case, including the evidence from the Tron Church witnesses, on its own merits before forming a concluded view as to the veracity of the appellant.  \"We cannot say what conclusion he would have reached had he done this, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a consideration of the evidence from the church, carried out on its merits and without any a priori assumption about the appellant\u0026rsquos lack of credibility, might have led him to form a different view of the appellant.\"  Lord Glennie said over the MA decision that the judge expressed concern about \"what appears to be a mean-spirited approach to some of the evidence\".  The FTT judge had referred to the Tron Church as an example of organisations which \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least are bona fide religious institutions or organisations.  Lord Glennie said: \"The use of the expression \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least appears to imply some doubt as to whether or not it is a bona fide religious organisation. If that is what he is saying he should say so clearly and give his reasons. If he has no good reason to doubt its bona fides then he should refrain from this insinuating reference.\"  The judgment said the men\u0027s appeals were heard together because they appeared to raise similar questions relating to the appropriate treatment of certain types of evidence in cases where the genuineness of conversion is challenged.  Lord Glennie said they also raised questions as to the status of evidence from church leaders or others holding positions of responsibility about the conduct of a person who has begun the process of admission into the church and as to the sincerity of his conversion to Christianity."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3814483.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-faces-strict-quotas-to-ensure-it-delivers-on-promises-on-scottish-content-on-new-channel","story":"  Proposed new licence conditions state that 95% of the output of the new BBC Scotland channel must consist of programmes made in Scotland and it must carry news during peak viewing times - between 6pm and 10.30pm.

But it has warned in its consultation paper: \"Should we be concerned by any aspect of the [BBC Scotland] on-going performance, including the level of repeats, we do not rule out imposing additional licence conditions on the new channel in future, if we consider it is appropriate to do so.\"  The BBC had indicated that the new channel which is expected to go live in February, next year, would have a news programme  covering \"international, UK and Scottish stories, told from a Scottish perspective\", with shorter bulletins at weekends.  It would feature shows that reflect Scottish life, including the opportunity to premiere some new comedy and drama.  The BBC has told the regulator the new channel would be broadcast from 7pm to midnight every evening. In addition, the channel would broadcast BBC Two simulcast from 12 noon to 7pm interspersed with ad hoc events such as live political daytime coverage - particularly First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions - and live sport. Daytime coverage would amount to no more than 150 hours per year.    The BBC has said that the new channel is expected to work in collaboration with other BBC television channels, particularly to enable it to premiere some drama and comedy. This would enable the channel to meet its ambition to schedule a wide range of programmes in the interests of audiences in Scotland.  It has been proposed that the new channel will take the place currently occupied by BBC Four on electronic programme guides  in Scotland. BBC Four would move down the EPG to a less prominent slot.  The Ofcom consultation will close on October 10, 2018 with a final decision on the proposals expected by the beginning of 2019, and before the new channel launch.  A BBC Scotland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome Ofcom\u0026rsquos consultation on conditions that should apply to the new BBC Scotland service and we will respond in due course.

Solaris - a tale about scientists probing a huge sentient, oceanic planet and their subsequent contact with unsettlingly strange phenomena - is being adapted for the stage by David Greig, playwright and director of the Lyceum.  The sci-fi tale will have a notable change from the novel and films, as Dr Kris Kelvin, the protagonist, will be a woman.  In the celebrated 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, Kelvin was played by Donatas Banionis, in the 2002 version, he was played by Clooney.  READ MORE: Artistic team announced for Lyceum\u0027s Local Hero  The production will be part of the Lyceum\u0027s 2019/20 season, and is a co-production with the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, where it will open in June 2019.  The play continues the theme of movies playing a role in the Lyceum\u0027s productions: it is also making a stage version of Bill Forsyth\u0027s Local Hero, and Touching the Void, which was also a film based on Joe Simpson\u0027s book.  The cast has yet to be fully confirmed but it will include Eamon Farren, whose recent credits include Richard Horne in Twin Peaks and Cust in The ABC Murders.  The gender reversal in the new play, which will be directed by Matthew Lutton, will mean that the dead lover or partner that haunts Kelvin on her expedition will be a young man, rather than a woman.  Matthew Lutton also directed last year\u0027s production of Picnic at Hanging Rock.  READ MORE: How Midsummer was reborn for the 2018 Festival  Greig said: \"It was Matthew that suggested it.  \"The book has one of the best premises - and the book\u0027s tone is playful, it has a lot more common with Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy and Red Dwarf than you might think: the whole opening chapter is the hilarious history of scientists who have studied Solaris, it is dazzling and funny.  \"But the more I looked it, I thought: why hasn\u0027t this been a play before? It is three people in an enclosed environment [a space station], a new person arrives and they experience visitors, or ghosts, which changes the attitude to what they should do.  \"It is a play: a one room play - now of course outside the room is a giant sentient planet, but the basic premise is there.\"  He said the oceanic planet would present obvious challenges to represent on the stage, but ones surmountable with special theatrical effects and lighting.  Greig added: \"The book has this heart, that really blew me away, because at its core you are looking at this planet that is a sea, but the sea is consciousness, and they cannot work out whether it is God: Does it understand everything? Or is it a child?\"  READ MORE: Greig on \u0027Local Hero\u0027 for the stage  He said that the play, which will feature an international cast, would be primarily drawing from Lem\u0027s novel, rather than the films, for its primary inspiration.  The story, he noted, was also \"deeply about suicide\" and its impact.  Greig said: \"Tarkovky\u0026rsquos film is moving and atmospheric but discovering the novel was like uncovering a whole new layer \u0026ndash lively and witty and playful and strange.  \"But this novel, and our imagining, is also a return to the future as it was conceived in the sixties \u0026ndash science fiction on stage is so often about tin foil, sliding doors and empty space whereas this is about mahogany bookcases, smoking cigarettes and spools of tape.\"  Greig became the eighth artistic director of The Lyceum in 2016.  On the lead role of Dr Kelvin, he said: \"A brilliant thing about sci-fi is that it allows you to say: in 100 years in the future, why on earth would we not expect to see a mixture of races and men and women?  \"So we are hoping to get a multi-ethnic cast from different parts of the world: because why on a space station would it not be like that?  \"We looked at Kelvin...and I looked at the suicide of the lover: Kelvin\u0027s lover in the book is his wife who committed suicide at 20, and she really doesn\u0027t have a personality.  \"When you flip it, there are just fewer stereotypes of the older woman looking back at the younger male lover.  \"Kelvin is a psychologist and an astronaut: it is a fantastic part to play.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-overtake-tories-as-uks-second-biggest-party-data-suggests","story":"  Data collated by the House of Commons Library estimated the Nationalists have just under 125,500 members, compared to the Tories\u0026rsquo 124,000.

A fund-raising campaign to continue his legal battle to remain in the UK has raised over \u0026pound17,000 Adoboli who is Ghanaian, but has lived in the UK since the age of 12, does not hold British citizenship.    The 38-year-old, who describes himself as British, has since his release from jail given many talks to students, financial traders and others in the banking industry about how to operate ethically and avoid making the mistakes he made.  He had been reporting once a month to the Home Office and had feared that he may be arrested in preparation for deportation after he was denied permission to judicially review the deportation proceedings.

The equivalent figure for the UK was 74 per cent.  Nearly 70 per cent of Scots also want universities to expand the recruitment of international students in future compared to 58 per cent in the rest of the UK.  When asked how long international students should be allowed to stay, 60 per cent of Scots said it should be at least two years.  The survey by Universities UK comes as the body launches new proposal for a post-study work visa for international students.  The proposed arrangements would allow international students to work in the UK for up to two years after graduating.  Currently, there are strict eligibility rules for post-study work in the UK, involving high costs for both students and employers and ious time restrictions.  Universities are also concerned that the impact of Brexit will see fewer students from EU countries.  Universities UK said the scheme would allow more employers in Scotland to access talented graduates from around the word, addressing workforce shortages and skills gaps in many sectors and industries.  It would also make Scotland a more attractive destination for international students and graduates and allow it to compete with countries who have more attractive post-study work policies, such as the USA and Australia.

We know there is support for this amongst employers as well as the public.\"  Universities UK new policy proposal comes in the same month as the Migration Advisory Committee is expected to publish its recommendations on following a length consultation into the impact of international students in the UK.  The study, conducted by ComRes, interviewed 4,302 adults across the UK and Northern Ireland in August this year.  Other findings included the fact only one quarter of respondents viewed an international student coming to study at a UK university as an \"immigrant\".  The study concluded: \"British adults are more likely to think of people other than students or researchers as immigrants.\"  Some 35 per cent of respondents across the UK said they wanted to see more international students, 40 per cent wanted numbers to stay the same and 13 per cent wanted fewer.  In January a report suggested international students generate nearly \u0026pound2 billion to the Scottish economy in tuition fees and wider spending.

This, Mr McDonald will argue, suggests many will have a right to register as British citizens and be impacted by the fees.  Amnesty International and The Children\u0027s Society are among those campaigning for an end to the high charges.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must scrap the extortionate and ever-increasing fees it is charging children to access their legal right to register as British citizens, declared the SNP MP.  \u0026ldquoIt is deeply immoral for the Home Office to be exploiting and profiteering from young people who have every right to be here as full and equal members of our society.  \u0026ldquoThousands of children, who are born and grow up in the UK, are now facing huge financial barriers to having their rightful citizenship recognised because of soaring fees introduced by Tory ministers, as part of their hostile approach to immigration.  Mr McDonald said the prohibitive fees and legal costs now involved in the application process were putting citizenship out of reach for too many children, particularly those living in disadvantaged and low income families.  \u0026ldquoThis indefensible Tory policy amounts to a citizen tax and risks leaving young people in a precarious status without the vital protections that citizenship affords such as freedom from immigration control and access to student finance, employment, housing, social security, healthcare, and other important services.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe appalling treatment of these children is yet another example of the damaging impact hostile Tory immigration policies are having on our society and another reason why immigration powers must be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so Scotland can create a system that meets our needs and values.

Due to past alcohol misuse, coupled with a previous conviction and mobility issues, he has found it difficult to get back in to employment.                                                     Joe has been on Fair Start Scotland for six weeks.  Through his vocational profiling talks with his adviser he identified his Job Goals and opportunities for finding work.         He has a previous experience in construction and contacts in the industry, so he felt he could secure work in this sector with some support. In agreement with his adviser, Joe felt that getting a Construction Skills Certification Scheme  card and gaining skills in Portable Appliance Testing  would be the best start to his journey to find work. With this combined training behind him, he could seek work which would involve inspection for minor defects or omissions in building works coupled with testing electrical equipment. Joe has now passed his CSCS training and got his Site Operative card, completed Control of Substances Hazardous to Health  training and updated his employability skills.

Going forward, Joe will continue his journey to find a job that suits his circumstances. Joe said: “So far I have found Fair Start Scotland helpful and my adviser has been encouraging and supportive. I’ve done training I didn’t know about like basic IT skills, and updated my skills in construction and health and safety.”Fair Start ScotlandFair Start Scotland is Scotland’s new devolved employment support service.

Launched in April this year, the service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is voluntary. This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose – choosing to participate won’t affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions. The service is based on partnership and joint working between the Scottish Government, and the public, third and private sectors to deliver better outcomes for people seeking employment support. Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: “We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential. “As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.”                                                                                                        To find out more and check whether you are eligible, visit www.mygov.scot/fairstart                "},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:50

after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small

funding boost from the Scottish Government.A sum of \u0026pound5.2 million will be spent across the Highlands with Caithness getting its share to provide items such as tampons and sanitary pads for learners.Following a recent VoucherCodesPro survey of over 2000 women, it was revealed that a monthly spend on sanitary products cost females \u0026pound13 per month.This had led for calls to combat \u0026ldquoperiod poverty to help ease the financial burden on women and female teens who may be on low incomes.Recently, Celtic football club announced it would be supplying free sanitary products in the ladies\u0026rsquo toilets at their Parkhead stadium for female supporters to use if needed.MSP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, Gail Ross of the SNP has backed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos initiativeIt was extermely successful when it was trialled in Aberdeen last year.The Scottish Government has also provided the charity, FareShare, with over \u0026pound500,000 to distribute free sanitary products to women on low incomes across Scotland.Mrs Ross said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP Government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound5.2 million investment in free sanitary products will allow students in the Highlands to remain focused on what matters \u0026ndash their studies.She underlined that \u0026ldquobasic sanitary provision is a right, not a privilege.\u0026ldquoThe notion that anyone should struggle to buy essential hygiene products is simply not acceptable and we should be proud that Scotland is leading the way in the fight against period poverty, Mrs Ross

AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:50 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Tuesday 4 Sep 2018 10:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

Dreams of American cheese could lead to nightmares for Brexiteers with a row over EU protections for regional brands like Greek feta cheese and Stornoway black pudding threatening to lead to a no-deal Brexit, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.                It’s a very short list of things blocking a deal on the UK’s withdrawal agreement from the EU, and it’s easy to understand why Northern Ireland is at the top of it.            The future of the Irish border is tied up in centuries-old tensions borne of culture and identity, as well as hard economic and political realities both sides believe they are justified in refusing to give ground.            But the same could be said about the next thing on the list, less talked-about and much less understood: feta cheese. Greece’s salty signature foodstuff could cause the UK’s Brexit deal to crumble, as ridiculous as that sounds.Not on its own, of course: the fate of feta is only part of the row over the EU system of geographical indications , which protect food and drink products linked to specific regions of Europe, or with particular traditions of artisanal production attached.Under EU rules, only feta produced in Greece from the milk of local ewes and goats can call itself feta. A cheese by any other name might taste as salty, but it can’t be marketed using the well-known name, or indeed any imagery suggesting a link to Greece.When the Greek government first sought EU protection for feta in 1996, there were objections from France, Germany and Denmark, with some reason. Feta only means ‘slice’, and there is no particular geographic focus to production like many Mediterranean foodstuffs, it has cousins spread across the former Ottoman empire.But food is as fundamental to identity as any aspect of culture, and the cheese is as much an internationally recognised symbol of Greece as the Parthenon indeed, if Greeks were asked to choose between getting back those missing marbles or giving away their exclusive right to feta, I wouldn’t want to guess which way it would go.            Feta’s history is as old as myth: when he wasn’t gobbling lost sailors, the Cyclops is described making cheese from ewe’s milk in Homer’s Odyssey. Mass production has yet to completely banish memory of the ancient methods.READ MORE: Boris Johnson launches attack on Theresa May’s Brexit approachIn the summer, shepherds would gather their flocks near cool, snow-fed mountain lakes and caverns to milk the ewes and hang the curds in cloth bags. When the young cheeses, salted and matured in brine, were ready for market, the barrels were loaded onto mule trains that plodded into the valleys. The animals knew the path, so watching over the cargo was childsplay: at age eight, my grandfather was put on top of the lead mule for the journey down the slopes of Mount Giona, overlooking the ruins of Delphi, tied with ropes so he didn’t slide off if he fell asleep.Protection for artisanal goods carries real economic significance for producers, but in a world made anxious by rapid globalisation, they also represent an anchor point of reassuring localism. It’s strange, therefore, that Brexiteers find such protections for cheese so ‘grating’.            “Why should we ban eg feta cheese from the USA, which tastes at least as good as EU feta and was introduced into the US by Greek-Americans and with same cultural heritage?” the former trade minister Greg Hands posted on Twitter at the weekend. Another Tory MP, Marcus Fysh, was equally cheesed off. “Brits could be free to eat tasty and cheaper Halloumi and Feta made in America,” he tweeted, before falling into error and tautology by adding that the UK could soon be selling “excellent English sparkling Champagne in Asia and Americas”. All Champagne is sparkling none of it comes from England. It comes from a region called Champagne, in France, hence the name.Neither MP explained how a US import shipped across the Atlantic will manage to undercut a product available in most supermarkets for less than £1.50 – and if cheaper cheese is the Brexit dividend, you’d think they would be a bit sheepish about it.READ MORE: Poll: Brexit will build majority support for Scottish independenceBut as trivial as it sounds, there’s a good reason why recognition of GIs after Brexit remains unresolved while weightier issues like citizens’ rights have been agreed. For the UK Government and Brexiteers, a free trade deal with the USA is the ultimate goal, but that prize is slipping away.Under Theresa May’s Chequers plan, the UK would effectively remain in the European single market for goods, and American agricultural produce in particular has always struggled to clear EU hurdles – think about the controversy over chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef.            To Downing Street’s embarrassment, ahead of his visit to Britain, Donald Trump himself warned a US-UK trade deal would be much more difficult, if not impossible. So Brexiteers want to dismantle one barrier to US produce – the GI system.It seems an insignificant gesture to a tiny American industry – it’s feta, not Ford. But Trump’s warmongering trade policy makes clear that he values symbolic wins in ‘heartland’ industries more than the economic bottom line.This week, US and Canadian trade negotiators are locked in last-ditch talks to save the North American Free-Trade Agreement. Trump has taken the talks to the wire in order to grind a tiny concession out of the Canadians – the removal of production caps that stabilise dairy prices. Getting American ‘feta’ into British supermarkets would be an even smaller victory, but may still be worth a tweet from the big cheese.Brexiteers like Hands and Fysh should beware, though – and not just because the prize can’t justify collapsing talks with the EU. Not including wines and spirits, 80 British foods have GI protections, and would be open to competition from the US  if the UK ripped them up. ‘Cornish’ pasties are already produced in America could Stornoway black pudding be next?Scotch whisky is also recognised under the EU GI scheme, although it also claims historic legal protections in both the UK and the US. In the uncertain environment of a no-deal Brexit, however, no food and drink producer anywhere in Britain would seek additional competition and an erosion of the brand. On the list of things that could make a meal out of Brexit, the cheese stands alone."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794343.1536002246!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon accused of green window dressing as scottish government reveals programme","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of \u0026#8220green window dressing\u0026#8221 as she prepares to today unveil the SNP\u0026#8217s Government\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220most ambitious ever\u0026#8221 investment in schools, hospitals and roads.                The First Minister will unveil her Programme for Government for the coming year at Holyrood as the Scottish Parliament returns from its summer recess.            But Ms Sturgeon is facing a growing rift with her key-budget allies, the pro-independence Greens, who derided a £17 million fund announced yesterday aimed at helping shift Scots to adopt electric travel and place the country at the “forefront of low carbon travel”.            The money will go towards 100 green buses and 1,500 electric charging points for vehicles. It comes on top of £20m for the transition to electric vehicles and a £4.8m for 500 new ultra low-emission vehicles for the public sector fleet.Talks are also advanced for fire stations to host charging points for electric cars under the drive. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is “actively looking” at allowing the public to use points across their 356 sites.READ MORE: Mike Russell raises ‘serious concerns’ over possibility of no-deal BrexitLast year’s Programme for Government was widely seen as the Scottish Government’s “greenest ever”, with ambitions plans to phase out petrol cars with electric vehicles by 2032.But Green MSP John Finnie warned commuters would care little for boasts that 100 new buses, out of a fleet of thousands, will “significantly increase” the overall green bus fleet.            “A little bit of green window dressing won’t impress the thousands of Scots who rely on buses every day,” he said. “What they want to see is a more reliable and less expensive service within an industry that is properly regulated.“If the government is serious about improving buses, they’ll make the necessary changes to toughen up the Transport Bill. While any investment aimed at reducing carbon emissions is welcome, including this small sum from the government, a hundred new buses out of a fleet of thousands makes a mockery of the First Minister’s claim that the investment places Scotland at the ‘forefront of low carbon travel’.“Furthermore, the claim really is laughable considering Norway will phase out petrol-powered cars seven years ahead of Scotland and that hybrid cars will be permitted to be sold here beyond the 2032 target.” Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon also called for a “strengthened commitment” to tackling climate change in today’s Government programme, as well as new policies to tackle waste and pollution. “The draft Climate Bill contains targets that are nowhere near good enough for Scotland to do its fair share on tackling the climate crisis,” Dr Dixon said.            “We’ll be looking for commitment from Nicola Sturgeon to aim higher, especially in the next decade, to reclaim Scotland’s place as an international climate leader. Any infrastructure announcements need to be low-carbon infrastructure, not new roads, bridges or runways. Any support for the North Sea oil industry should only be directed towards helping businesses and workers transition from high-carbon to low-carbon industries.”Ms Sturgeon insists today’s programme would “go further still” after last year’s flagship green pledges. She said: “Through the package of support we’re announcing in this year’s Programme for Government, as well as our continued investment of £1 billion a year in low carbon and public transport, more people will be able to play their part in putting Scotland at the forefront of low carbon travel.”The First Minister said her 2018/19 programme would also contain “major announcements” related to health, the economy and social security. She said: “In this programme for government I am committing to the most ambitious long-term level of infrastructure spend that Scotland has ever seen .That is investment in schools, hospitals and transport, and in digital connectivity and clean energy.            “This Programme for Government continues the major reforms that are underway in our health, education and justice systems and it builds on the progress we have made in tackling inequalities.”She added: “Of course we cannot ignore the fact that Brexit puts all of our progress at risk, with uncertainty being made worse by the Tories’ blundering and the prospect of a no-deal outcome. But equally, we must not let Brexit define us, curtail our ambitions or halt Scotland’s progress.“As we look to the future, however, one thing is certain our commitment – my commitment – to making sure that all of Scotland flourishes and that we remain outward looking and confident.”Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw has accused Ms Sturgeon of “getting her excuses in early over her Brexit claims”.Labour has published a list of key areas where it wants to see change, including an end to Primary 1 testing, an NHS safe staffing bill and a radical anti-austerity budget.Labour leader Richard Leonard said: “Scotland needs real change, not more of the same, in the Programme for Government this week.“The dividing line in Scotland now rests between investment and growth with Labour, or cuts and division with the Tories and the SNP.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called for action on teacher recruitment and mental health.“Under this government our health service is crippled and education is slipping,” he said.“This year we need to see big moves from the SNP to improve teacher recruitment and retention.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure.

That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.

A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

They still look like the boys from the dance hall, even though the boys are now virtuosos.\nGaelic was woven into every moment of Friday and Saturday nights, from the Glasgow Islay choir singing with Donnie Munro to Malcolm Jones being projected onto the walls of Stirling Castle riffing MacCrimmon\u0026#8217s Lament.\nMost people might not have been there for that. Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend

champions","story":"\n\nPAUL\n Munster has been appointed at the Technical Director and first team coach of Indian champions Minerva Punjab FC. \n\nThe former Linfield and Cliftonville striker joins the club after guiding Örebro SK to their maiden U19 Swedish Cup success last year. \n\nMunster had been mulling over whether or not to continue his career in Sweden. In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"markets residents stress the need for social homes at gates of city hall","story":"\n\nRESIDENTS \nfrom the Markets took to the gates of City Hall last night to reiterate their call that land marked for social housing remains so.\nResidents and campaigners gathered on Monday night to mark the first anniversary of Belfast City Council’s vote to earmark land on the Gasworks site – previously zoned for social housing – available instead for a hotel extension and a multistorey carpark.\nMembers from the Homes Now campaign group handed in a petition to Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and Deputy Lord Mayor, Alliance’s Emmett McDonough-Brown signed the Homes Now pledge.\nHomes Now campaigner Bernie Dobbin said: “The people of the Markets have waited too long for adequate social housing to be built in the area and we are no longer prepared to take verbal assurances from officials and politicians.\n“Time and again, these officials and politicians have broken their word and left residents high and dry. This is why we are asking councillors and officials to sign the Homes Now pledge – for their commitment to become a matter of public record.\n“Belfast City Council have sent out a lot of positive messages since the disgraceful decision of their Planning Committee last September, but still not a brick for new housing has been laid. Meanwhile, families are forced to stay indefinitely in emergency accommodation, share with relatives and ‘sofa surf’ – this cannot continue.\n“Like communities across Belfast and throughout Ireland, we are demanding that those in power recognise the nature of the housing crisis and act accordingly.

I’m going to the Euro qualifiers in October with the U-17s and won the Milk Cup with County Antrim last year.”\nBarry is usually found either in midfield or playing out on the wing and as a Liverpool fan growing up, looked up to players such as Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho as well as Barcelona legend, Lionel Messi.\nOf course, he has a long way to go to emulate his idols, but he has done everything right so far to have captured the interest of a professional club in England.\n“They saw me playing for Northern Ireland and asked me over for a trial,” explains the Turf Lodge lad.\n“I went over for two weeks and did well, so they brought me back for another two weeks and asked me to sign at the end of it.”\nBeing away from home is not a problem for the rising star as there are some familiar faces also signed to the Lancashire club.\n“There are two boys I would know from the Northern Ireland team living over there already,” he continued.\n“I already knew them before I went over. That makes it far easier for me to settle in.”\nBarry made the journey across to England at the weekend as he begins life at his new club and he is hoping to make his mark early.\nThe hope is to sufficiently impress in the next two years to earn himself another contract when he turns 18.\n “This is a completely new start with a new team and new players,” he acknowledged.\n“The aim is to get offered to stay for longer after these two years and for now I will be playing with the U-18s and hopefully start to climb the ladder.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"140m regeneration plan for belfasts north foreshore giants","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

a welcome hub, a leisure and sports innovation hub, an adventure hub and a theme park hub - will be completed by 2026.\n\nThe council estimates the development will create 200 construction jobs and sustain up to 1,400 jobs on the visitor attraction when operational.\n\nCouncillors also approved the lease of two sites through Lisney commercial estate agents for Evermore Ltd’s proposed £27m development of a data centre to support the digital economy and Viridian Ltd’s plans for a £20m anaerobic digestion facility to generate and export electricity from organic waste.\n\nInspired by the Cave Hill area’s renowned association with Swift’s book, Gulliver’s Travels, Belfast City Council has named the former landfill site Giant’s Park – also fitting as it’s the city’s largest development site, which opened for business in May 2017.\n\nGiant’s Park is already home to a £20m state-of-the-art film studio complex, developed by Belfast Harbour, with NI Screen marketing the film studio to its global industry contact network.\n\nAlderman Jim Rodgers, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee said: “I’m very much looking forward to seeing this area of the city really coming to life through our regeneration plans. \n\n\"Not only does Giant’s Park offer businesses excellent connectivity through our airports and motorways, there’s the obvious additional benefit of being able to recruit from Belfast’s strong skills and talent base.\n\n“We’ve made a firm commitment to stimulating job creation in the Belfast Agenda, and it’s the central objective of the Belfast Region City Deal proposition that we’re currently working on with our partners. \n\n\"By developing this vast site, we stand to gain jobs, visitors, and vital rates income which we can reinvest in Belfast.”\n\nThe Giant’s Park infrastructure project was part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland  and the European Regional Development Fund , under the European Sustainable Competitiveness Programme for Northern Ireland, along with investment from Belfast City Council.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"1m belfast safety centre to close after psni","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But at a protest outside Belfast City Hall organised by People Before Profit councillor Matthew Collins yesterday, west Belfast residents said the new service was \"going to create havoc\".\n\nStockmans Lane resident Paul Kennedy  said he had received a letter last week to say bin lorries can no longer access his street due to the number of cars parked there, which he attributes to the removal of parking spaces on the main road to accommodate the Glider.\n\n\"People are parking down the side streets now,\" he said.\n\n\"I can\u0027t get my bins emptied.\n\n\"And if the bin lorries can\u0027t get down, how is the Fire Service or Ambulance Service going to get down?\n\n\"It\u0027s the difference between dying and not dying.\n\n\"And because of the build-up in the main street, the side streets where kids are running around are going to turn into a thoroughfare.\n\n\"You don\u0027t feel safe around your own area. I\u0027m not against the Glider, but at what cost? Someone\u0027s life?\"\n\nAndersonstown resident Joseph McArdle , a private taxi driver of around 20 years and a former bus driver, said he \"may have to call it quits\" as he won\u0027t be able to earn a living because of the Glider\u0027s introduction.\n\n\"The vast majority of taxis in this town are private taxis, but we still do a public service,\" he said. \"We were told to put meters in, and what are the punters going to think of a two-mile journey which might cost double?\n\n\"It will put some taxi drivers out of business, the same as businesses on the Falls Road or east Belfast. Wait until the winter comes when people can\u0027t get down to access these buses. \n\n\"They depend on taxis.\"\n\n\"This is serious, it\u0027s going to create havoc, especially where schools like St Kevin\u0027s Primary School are concerned.\n\n\"This city is too small for 12-hour bus lanes. It\u0027s harming the community it\u0027s meant to help.\"\n\nDisabled driver Fintan Heatley  said that he could no longer park his car \"anywhere near\" his home.\n\n\"My house is on the Falls Road and you can\u0027t park there any more,\" he said.\n\n\"Because people can\u0027t park in the main roads they are trying to park in the side streets, so residents have nowhere to go.\" \n\nMeanwhile, P1 teacher at St Kevin\u0027s Una Toman , who lives on the Glen Road, said her concern was for the children at her school.\n\n\"We have just under 600 pupils and there\u0027s nowhere for parents to park,\" she said.\n\n\"It\u0027s a real safety hazard.\n\n\"I just hope that it\u0027s not going to take an accident for them to do something. I don\u0027t want kids to lose their lives.\"\n\nYesterday, the Belfast  boarded the Glider service to east Belfast, which was running 23 minutes late as rush hour began.\n\nDundonald woman Kathryn Spratt  said her earlier morning service from Dundonald park and ride had \"worked well\" but called the afternoon wait \"frustrating\".\n\n\"My old bus was only ever about five minutes late. Before I had a choice of three buses, now I only have one,\" she said.\n\n\"The other services have been taken off because of the Glider. It is frustrating. I have two kids who are waiting at home for me.\n\n\"I think it\u0027s teething problems. I have no other option, so I\u0027m just hoping it\u0027ll get better.\"\n\nBelmont Road man David McClymont, who was also travelling home on the service after using it to get to work that morning, described it as \"really easy\" to use.\n\n\"It took about the same amount of time,\" he said.\n\n\"I was a bit underwhelmed when I got on it this morning, but then again it\u0027s the first day. \n\n\"If the system works how it\u0027s supposed to work it will be good. To wait over 20 minutes isn\u0027t a great start, but I\u0027m not going to judge it too early.\"\n\nHowever, east Belfast woman Hazel Patterson  called the service \"absolutely superb\".\n\n\"The best thing is that the driver is behind a sealed unit, so there\u0027s no faffing about with people looking change or asking how to get anywhere,\" she said.\n\n\"It\u0027s straight on and people have already got their ticket. People don\u0027t realise how much time is wasted when a bus stops to process a queue of people.\n\n\"People who drive into town are going to be clogged up in traffic, and they will see Glider after Glider passing them by and maybe the penny will drop.\" \n"},{"url":null,"title":"long to meet sinn fein and dup as parties push to end stalemate","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It must also be fully inclusive of all parties and both governments.\"\n\nMr Maskey accused the Government of abandoning its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement due to its Westminster pact with the DUP.\n\n\"There is a clear requirement under the agreement for the two governments to take decisive action and determine how the obstacles to power-sharing will be explicitly removed, by what means and in what time frame under their joint stewardship,\" he added. \n\nSpeaking earlier, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"For nearly 600 days the people of Northern Ireland have been denied a government by Sinn Fein.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

Glenn McGrath it wasn’t, but somehow it had the desired effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wicket came in the final over of the match, with tail-ender Ishant caught behind. It’s fair to say it will go down as one of the more meaningless wickets in Test history in terms of the match situation.\n\n“It was a genius bit of bowling,” Cook joked afterwards. “No, it was rubbish to be honest with you, but it’s one more wicket than David Saker, our bowling coach, has got so that makes me very happy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless current skipper Joe Root allows Cook a ceremonial bowl against India in the final Test of the series – perhaps to have another go at Ishant – it’s likely the 33-year-old will bow out with bowling figures of one wicket for seven runs off 18 balls.\n\nThat would mean he retires with a better average than England’s all-time leading wicket taker, James Anderson. Not bad at all, Chef.

I’m not going to be able to do this.” \n\nShe then put down her microphone and walked offstage.\n\nMs Levi anxiously followed her offstage as some of the stunned audience awkwardly clapped.\n\nIn a tweet several hours later, Ms Lewinsky said she had been misled.\n\n“In fact, the exact question the interviewer asked first, she had put to me when we met the day prior.

They organised Balloons with JP’s name on them and we released them in Academy Road,” said Jenny.\n\nOn Tuesday the Coyle family presented a cheque to St. Vincent De Paul , with all the money raised on the walk and memorial night.\n\nIt was a charity that was close to JP’s heart, Jenny added.\n\n“JP was very, very kind to SVDP,” said Jenny. \n\n“He loved going to the chapel when it was quiet and lighting candles and he was always putting money into the box.\n\n“He would have helped them too lifting furniture and things.\n\n“A lot of people are facing hardship at the minute with the introduction of the Universal Credit benefits, and SVDP help people in a very discreet and quiet way.”\n\nVincent added: “SVDP do amazing work especially in these times of austerity and cuts.\n\n“Every penny does count.”\n\n\nAbove - The Coyle family pictured presenting a cheque for £5,412.58 to St. Vincent de Paul\u0027s Sally Kennedy, president of Our Lady\u0027s Longtower Conference, Dominic Burke, president St. Eugene\u0027s Conference and Sean Gallagher, St. Eithne\u0027s Conference.

These initiatives assist young people to take better control of their lives, reengage in training and avoid being drawn into criminal or sectarian activity.\n\nThe remaining funding, £810,000, has also been allocated across four projects in the Peace Impact Programme , which assists marginalised communities to resolve complex issues relating to identity and the conflict. \n\nDr Adrian Johnston, Chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, said: “We still live in a deeply fractured society and political uncertainties are adding greater pressures to communities that are working hard to move forward. The risks taken by groups we support cannot be taken for granted. \n\n\"In many difficult areas, the Fund and these groups are delivering the only interventions that are preventing the escalation of tensions and polarisation. In challenging circumstances, their ambition and vision deserve to be equally met with political action and leadership.\n\n“With the limited resources available, the Fund is making important contributions that support stability and progress, particularly among communities that had not previously recognised a peace dividend. However, the Fund alone is not equipped for the scale of challenges that may emerge during an indefinite political vacuum. \n\n\"Each generation should expect a better life than the last. That can only happen if there is political will and adequate resources to help resolve the legacy issues that continue to blight communities.”\n\nThe Chairman took the opportunity to thank the international donors to the Fund - the European Union and the Governments of the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand - for their support.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nAmong the latest funding drive are these Derry projects:\n\n£202,402 to Causeway Rural \u0026amp Urban Network  for the Building Resilience and Knowledge in Education  Project.

And so, my message to Lindsey and Sean, to these warriors to be ordained today, is to be sure to keep your ministry well-oiled with obedience, integrity and love.”\n\n“It is easy to obey,” Canon Merrick said, “when that obedience seems reasonable and pleasing to our own understanding and desires – and particularly when it’s found pleasing to those around us. But will we waver when we don’t see the results anticipated, though we still believe this is God’s will?” \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nHe shared a remark made by the former US President, John Quincy Adams, whose repeated attempts to have slavery abolished in the 1830s proved fruitless: “Duty is mine, results are God’s.” \n\n“Ministry is a call to abide in Him,” Canon Merrick said, “to serve His will and step out in obedient faith, knowing that duty is ours, results are God’s.”\n\nCanon Merrick said ministry was also a call to integrity. “We must always be careful not to use people to build His church, but to serve people as He builds His church among us. And in all these things, we must be the same person behind the pulpit as we are when we are at home with the family and when we are alone in the study. That is what characterises the woman or man of integrity.”\n\nMinistry was also a call to love, Canon Merrick said. The call to love was not always easy but it always resulted in God’s peace and that was priceless. \n\n“My prayer for you this evening,” Canon Merrick told the two ordinands, “is that your work will always be characterised by obedience, integrity and love, as a well-oiled machine continually advancing the Kingdom of God until the coming of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe choir and choristers of St Columb’s Cathedral provided music for the two-hour long Service of Ordination, after which the congregation made their way to St Augustine’s Parish Hall, on the City Walls, for refreshments and speeches. \n\nReverend Hanily said he and Reverend Farrell needed people’s prayers more than ever now, while Reverend Farrell asked family, friends and parishioners to affirm them both in their ministries. Bishop Good said Derry and Raphoe was blessed to have both new priests joining the Diocese. “We’ve got two stars,” the Bishop said.\n\n\nPictured above: Rev Lindsey Farrell  and Rev Sean Hanily with Bishop Ken Good during the Service of Ordination of Priests at St Columb\u0027s Cathedral.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plans massive new lidl store crescent link retail park waterside area derry","story":"\nThere are plans for massive new Lidl store at Crescent Link Retail Park in Waterside area of Derry.\n\nThe move comes after Lidl announced plans for a new outlet in the Springtown area in the cityside.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nLidl will now be holding two drop-in sessions in the Crescent Community and Cultural Centre, this Thursday, September 6 from 11am to 1pm and Thursday, September13 from 4pm to 7pm to allow people see the proposed plans for a new Lidl Supermarket on Crescent Link.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic alert foyle bridge derry close tonight following three nights faciliate maintenance work","story":"\nMotorists have been advised that the Foyle Bridge in Derry will be closed overnight tonight and also tomorrow, Monday, September 3, Tuesday, September 4 and Wednesday, September 5 each evening from 7pm to 7am to faciliate maintenance.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the City Centre Initiative  urged motorists to leave extra time for journeys aand follow local diversions.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plans in full swing to bring action packed dayinsure wales rally gb to north wales","story":"\nSteve Cridge oversees the Dayinsure Wales Rally GB Rally Village\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474894/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nSteve Cridge  and his team are preparing for the world championship\u0026#39s \u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtreturn\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474893/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nSteve Cridge surveys the Dayinsure Wales Rally GB Rally Village\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474895/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nFIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP 2017 -WRC Wales Rally GB  -

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
