Nine more patients have been enrolled to test the procedure.Mr Hellebo said the woman, who had been ‘sceptical’ before the procedure, went from being able to see just nine letters on the eye test chart to 29. People are considered legally blind if they can read fewer than 36 letters on the 100-letter chart. ‘She said she could now see the food on her plate, which is really motivating for us to hear,’ he added.

He said: ‘The failure rate on Monday is usually at 36 per cent nationally.‘But on Friday, it is more than two per cent less. On Saturday, it’s five per cent less than Monday. So if the ‘weekend effect’ can do that, it probably means that if you take your car just before the Christmas or Easter holiday, you are more likely to pass the test.’The researchers believe that the reason why a silver car passes its test better than cars of other colour may be because it has become associated with reliability.         Researchers found that Mercedes cars have the lowest MOT failure rate, while most cars pass in Central London. Silver cars also have lowest failure rates while white cars are the worstIn their paper, the academics explain: ‘A grey or silver car is associated with balance, high quality and reliability and this would be consistent with our evidence that such cars are more likely to receive benefit of the doubt in tests.‘It is also the logo colour for Mercedes-Benz and Honda, two brands that enjoy a reputation for reliability.’Prof Talavera found that a Mercedes vehicle is the most likely to pass its MOT test, compared with any other car with the same mileage and age.Mercedes cars typically have a 15 per cent failure rate, followed by Porsches at 18 per cent, and Lexus at 21 per cent.Conversely, Renaults have the highest fail rate at 45 per cent, followed by Rover at 42 per cent and Alfa Romeo at 41 per cent.Failure rates in Central London were lowest at 20 per cent, followed by the Essex towns of Romford at 26 per cent and Southend-on- Sea at 28 per cent.‘Where you tend to get fewer garages and more cars, the pass rate is higher,’ said Prof Talavera.Annual MOT tests were first introduced in Britain in 1960 for vehicles that were more than ten years old.Now, any vehicle over three years old must pass the yearly test. "},{"url":null,"title":"Scientists use facial recognition technology prove animals stress free","story":"Share this article Thirty-six pigs are involved and 3D and 2D cameras are used to identify happiness, sadness, pain or stress from their facial expressions.‘The challenge is to get the pigs to look straight at the camera,’ said Dr Kenny Rutherford, a scientist at the college’s Pig Research Centre in Midlothian. ‘It’s like getting kids to perform for a passport photo.’The aim is to help farmers provide the best rearing conditions so supermarkets can boast on their labels that pork chops, bacon and ham come from ‘happy’ pigs.Dr Rutherford said: ‘We won’t be able to actually see a pig smile but we hope to see an absence of tension or a retraction of muscles on a pig’s face that would indicate contentment.’The first results from the research are expected before the end of the year. "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former club chairman Jonathan O\u0026rsquoBrien was briefly removed from stadiumPresident highlights importance of society\u0026rsquos home visits at Dublin ceremonyProtesters say Waterford is only designated cardiac centre without funds for 247 serviceSecretary of Kerry District League says former chief executive told him he intends to step downOrange alert will be in place for Co Cork and Co Waterford over rest of weekendPharmaceutical industry body suspected site may have been \u0026lsquocompromised\u0026rsquoEnnis District Court judge says case surrounding three men struggling over piece of furniture is \u0026lsquoriddled with contradictions\u0026rsquoJohn Gibson (28) was shot dead at a shopping centre in Dublin two years agoPatrick O\u0026rsquoDonovan says ex FAI boss was \u0026lsquoa great man to bring out the cheque book\u0026rsquoPelosi is also due to make a speech in the D\u0026aacuteil to commemorate its 100th anniversaryFifty-two-year-old accused of collecting information likely to be of use to terroristsCourt of Appeal rules against DPP over \u0026lsquounduly lenient\u0026rsquo sentencingNearly five million Rock \u0026lsquon Play Sleepers after reports link product to dozens of baby deathsInvestigation into death of Michael Dwyer in police raid held up by \u0026lsquofarcical\u0026rsquo related trialGarrett Kelleher\u0026rsquos case dismissed in March as Nama not subject to US court\u0026rsquos jurisdictionPotential for future cost increases remains, according to HSE documentDrew Harris\u0026rsquos refusal to promote garda\u0026iacute linked to their being subject of inquiriesAllegations of inspector doing work at Coolmore Stud surfaced in 2016 and again in 2017"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3859987.1555188589!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"john delaney s future in doubt following fai talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenior figures in Irish football are trying this weekend to end the controversy around the €100,000 loan the FAI received from its former CEO John Delaney. Photograph: Laura HuttonThe  Former FAI chief executive John Delaney’s future with the organisation is the subject of mounting speculation following discussions at its headquarters in Abbotstown on Saturday.Talks aimed at drawing a line under the controversy that followed the revelation of a €100,000 loan Mr Delaney gave the association in 2017 have intensified in the last 24 hours.John O’Regan, secretary of the Kerry District League, told The  Mr Delaney had texted him today to say Mr Delaney would be stepping down from the FAI board, but would continue his role with Uefa. Mr O’Regan said Mr Delaney had texted subsequently to say he was “not gone yet”.Mr O’Regan made similar comments to Radio Kerry earlier today.The ongoing controversy resulted in protests at a number of League of Ireland matches on Friday night. At Turner’s Cross in Cork gardaí and security staff intervened after Cork City fans displayed a banner calling for Mr Delaney to stand down.Mr Delaney resigned as FAI chief executive days after the controversial loan was reported and took up the newly created role of executive vice-president with the FAI.Well-placed sources said several members of the FAI board are now wavering in their support for Mr Delaney.Two board members are believed to be firmly opposed to Mr Delaney continuing in his new role.There are, however, significant concerns that if Mr Delaney was to leave his post, Ireland’s influence at Uefa, the European governing body for soccer, could also be diminished at a time the association is pursuing a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup alongside the English, Welsh and Scottish football associations.Mr Delaney is a member of Uefa’s executive until 2021, having been elected in 2017. The terms of his departure from the FAI would also have to be addressed.Alongside the initial two board members, several more are said to be uncertain about supporting Mr Delaney, as well as other board members seen as being loyal to the former chief executive.It follows a week of intense controversy for the FAI, culminating in an appearance at the Oireachtas sport committee on Wednesday where Mr Delaney read a prepared statement but refused to answer questions about the loan, citing legal advice.Sources were also strongly critical of honorary treasurer Eddie Murray following his appearance at the hearing, when he incorrectly said the FAI had just one bank account. The association has 24 bank accounts.Efforts to contact the FAI press office were unsuccessful on Saturday afternoon.Earlier this week sponsors of the FAI said they placed a strong emphasis on good corporate governance, and that they expected the recommendations of two FAI-commissioned reports to be implemented in full.However, other sources said they were unhappy that the terms of reference for the reviews had not been published, and that there was no clarity as to whether the reports from consultancy firms Mazars and Grant Thornton would be released in full on completion.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday questions “need to be answered” by the FAI and Mr Delaney over the €100,000 loan.Speaking after a week in which Mr Delaney refused to answer questions at an Oireachtas committee about the loan, Mr Varadkar said: “I don’t think anyone would be satisfied by it”.“The public, taxpayers, football fans would have like those questions to be answered.”Mr Varadkar added Mr Delaney had been under no obligation to answer questions at the Oireachtas committee.“The truth is that he was within his legal rights not to answer those questions. He is not a public servant and therefore is not accountable to the Oireachtas,” he said.“However, the FAI is accountable to the Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement and is accountable to Sport Ireland for the money they get.”Elsewhere, sources said that they doubted sponsors would abandon the FAI immediately, despite several issuing statements on the controversy this week. One source close to a current FAI sponsor said that it was likely brands would adopt a “wait and see” attitude, adding that it was “not the role of a sponsor to decide what the next part of the process should be”.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3859928.1555150066!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit pro eu parties in uk to use elections as soft referendum","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, wears Union  Jack socks during the party’s European Parliament elections campaign launch in Coventry, UK, on Friday.   Photograph: BloombergPro-EU parties in Britain, including the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Independent Group (TIG), will not form pacts or alliances at the forthcoming EU elections, hoping to use the poll as a “soft referendum” to show a surge in support for remain.If no Brexit deal is passed by parliament, the UK will be required to hold the poll on May 23rd.The Lib Dems, the mainstream party hoping to capitalise most on anti-Brexit discontent, has almost finalised its manifesto and plans a huge operation of ground campaigning targeting remain voters.“We want to use the momentum from the locals, which very few other parties will have, as a springboard for European elections,” a party source said.“Voters across all of Great Britain want to vote for a pro-remain party. We’re going to give them all the chance to vote Lib Dem.”The TIG MP Chuka Umunna claimed his new party - Change UK - would be “the leading option on the ballot paper” arguing for a second referendum.The breakaway group of former Labour and Tory MPs has invited its network of supporters to apply to be MEP candidates “to give the British people a real choice”.The timeframe for potential candidates will require final applications to be submitted by Monday morning and interviews later next week. In its email to supporters, the group said it was expecting a high number of applications and potential candidates should be prepared for a significant commitment.The party intends to carry out “background verification checks” on candidates, who must provide all their social media handles, in the hope of avoiding the embarrassments that have plagued many start-up parties.Candidates will also be asked to “outline your perspective on why politics is broken and how it needs to change”, as well as setting out their commitments to the Nolan principles of public life - selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.The group’s interim leader, Heidi Allen, a former Tory MP, said they would encourage “anyone who wants to see a people’s vote on Brexit, who wants to remain a full member of the European Union, and who wants to shake up and change our broken politics”.The Green party is also hoping to capitalise on running with an explicitly pro-remain stance. Party co-leader Siân Berry said the Greens would “mobilise one of the strongest pro-EU movements anywhere” and would stress the importance of the elections to send a message.“We will not let the government downplay how important these elections are. This isn’t just about the European Union - it’s about the country we live in,” she said.“One thing we can agree on is that our politics is broken, and has failed to fix the intolerable inequality and insecurity which caused the Brexit vote. A vote for the Greens is a vote against this chaos, a vote for change, a vote to remain and a vote for an open and confident Britain.”Renew, another emerging new party that has fought local elections, will also run pro-EU candidates in the EU elections. The party leader, Annabel Mullin, said the elections would be “seen by many as a soft referendum on EU membership”.The two major parties are also likely to see applicants hoping to run on a remain platform. Stanley Johnson, the father of Boris Johnson and a former Tory MEP, has announced his wish to stand again for the party to make a pro-European case. - Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jane BarlowPA Wire Theresa May is facing calls to open up talks about leaving the European Union to ministers from Holyrood and Cardiff in a bid to help break the Brexit impasse.Scottish constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell made the plea shortly after Mrs May was granted more time by Europe to reach agreement over Britain’s future relationship with the EU.The prime minister now has until October 31 to find a way forward, and Mr Russell stressed she must “use this extra time wisely”.He said “all parties and all devolved governments” should be invited to the negotiating table.He urged Mrs May to “drop her red lines”, which have seen her insist the UK’s departure from the EU will also see it leave both the single market and the customs union.The Scottish Government has repeatedly made the case for Britain to remain part of these arrangements, arguing this will help mitigate the economic impact of Brexit.Mr Russell said: “Taking us out of a market around eight times bigger than the UK will cost jobs, make people poorer and undermine the democratic decision of the people of Scotland to remain in the European Union.“The Scottish government set out compromise plans that would keep both Scotland and the UK in the single market but these were dismissed out of hand by the UK Government.”Meanwhile, the boss of a biscuit firm in Forres, Moray, has warned Brexit would make its plans to expand into Japan more difficult, as well as increase its costs.Maclean’s Highland Bakery produces traditional shortbread, biscuits and oatcakes, but managing director Lewis Maclean said while the Brexit extension was a “reprieve”, he has a “really terrible feeling” about the way forward.He said: “My fourth biggest customer is based in Copenhagen and worth £100,000 a year to my business.

Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty ImagesMore than 70 Parliamentarians have signed a letter urging the Government to ensure Julian Assange faces Swedish authorities if they request his extradition.Labour and Co-op MP Stella Creasy shared a copy of the note on social media which has been sent to Home Secretary Sajid Javid.Mr Assange (47), the WikiLeaks founder, is facing rape and sexual assault allegations in Sweden.The message, shared on Twitter, reads: “We are writing to request that you do everything you can to champion action that will ensure Julian Assange can be extradited to Sweden in the event Sweden make an extradition request.“This would be so the formal investigation into an allegation of rape can be concluded and, if appropriate, a charge can be made and any trial can take place.“We do not presume guilt, of course, but we believe due process should be followed and the complainant should see justice be done.“We urge you to stand with the victims of sexual violence and seek to ensure the case against Mr Assange can now be properly investigated.”The rape allegation has a limitation period which expires in August 2020, it adds.Mr Assange spent almost seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought political asylum in 2012 after failing in his legal battle against extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted over two separate allegations, one of rape and one of molestation.In May 2017, Sweden’s top prosecutor dropped the long-running inquiry into a rape claim against Mr Assange, which he has always denied.But his arrest prompted the lawyer for a Swedish woman who alleged she was raped by Mr Assange during a visit to Stockholm in 2010 to say they wanted the case reopened.Prosecutors in Sweden have since confirmed that, while the investigation has not been resumed, they are looking into the case.Former home secretary Lord Blunkett said people giving Assange “unqualified support” were being “extremely unwise”.Writing in The Times, the former Labour MP said: “It is indeed important that any extradition hearing should be fair and take into account the mitigation of genuine revelations of wrongdoing made in 2010.“However, supporting a fair hearing is not the same as a political demand that he should be treated as some kind of hero he remained in the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid previous extradition hearings concerning claims of rape and abuse in Sweden.“A kneejerk response that presumes that hacking is acceptable if the perpetrators can claim that their motives were journalistic is particularly dangerous when it emanates from those aspiring to become prime minister or home secretary, such as Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott.” – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"big cat con inside africas shocking battery farms lions","story":"The growing appetite for \u0027conservation holidays\u0027 has shone a light on the dark – and poorly regulated – industry of lion farming, where felines are destined not to be \u0027released into the wild\u0027 - but to be shot by trophy hunters and their bones exported to Asia for use in traditional medicine.

No wonder people are reluctant to switch, even if that means paying more\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentEnergy regulator OfGem has introduced new rules in a bid to reduce the number of failing energy firms The importance of OfGem introducing financial health tests for would be energy suppliers can be seen by clicking on another headline on its website concerning its appointment of SSE, a member of the big six energy firms, to take on customers of the collapsed Brilliant Energy.\u0026nbspFar too many new entrants have ended up in a similarly unhappy place, making victims of their customers who have sometimes been left facing an administrative nightmare, or worse.\u0026nbspMillions of Britons are paying more than they need to for their energy, even after the introduction of OfGem\u0027s price cap. That will only be addressed if they are willing to switch.\u0026nbspEnergy bills to rise for millions across UK as Ofgem hikes price capNew energy rules could save households £45 a year, Ofgem saysExtra Energy becomes sixth UK supplier to go bust this yearThe collapse of firms like Brilliant Energy - and there have been 11 such failures over the past six moths - has acted\u0026nbspas a powerful disincentive towards their\u0026nbspdoing that.\u0026nbspThe new rules, which come into force in June, are designed to address the problem. They will require firms to prove that they can fund their operations adequately for the first year. They will have to pass a fit and proper test, focussing on their mangers and owners. And they will have to prove that they can meet commitments to customer service.\u0026nbspThe regulations may serve to discourage some perfectly capable firms from taking the plunge\u0026nbspbecause regulations often do that, even when they are perfectly sensible (as these are).\u0026nbspBut the cost will ultimately be outweighed by the benefits if the requirements\u0026nbspserve to reduce the disturbing number of failures we have witnessed. That has to be the regulator’s chief concern. \u0026nbspThe irony of OfGem selecting SSE to pick up the pieces after the collapse of Brilliant Energy is rich. It is a member of the big six. It was hoped that new entrants like Brilliant would serve to reduce the dominance they have had over the market and lead to lower prices for consumers. The sheer number of failures\u0026nbsphave ended up pushing them their way, and not just through their picking up the pieces.\u0026nbspPeople with SSE and its peers (British Gas, EDF Energy, E.on, Scottish Power, Npower) may very well\u0026nbspfeel that it’s a case of better the devil you know even if it means paying more.

But it has had to warn that even with all that it may never make money.\u0026nbspUber’s story is much bigger and more complex than that of rival Lyft, which blazed a trail for it\u0026nbspwhen it joined a Nasdaq, only for the road to turn bumpy when investors started to take stock of what they’d bought.\u0026nbspBoth companies cut their teeth with the business of matching drivers, working as independent contractors, with customers. They have revolutionised\u0026nbspthe personal transportation market in the process.\u0026nbspBut Uber’s vision goes way beyond that.\u0026nbspComparing the two is like putting a carton of plain vanilla ice cream (Lyft) up against a\u0026nbspBen \u0026amp Jerrys Cookie Dough S’wich.\u0026nbspUber has ambitions in freight, meal deliveries, logistics.

It\u0027s true that Uber has shaken up its governance model, and says it’s addressing a problematic workplace culture that resulted in a series of disturbing allegations of sexual harassment and misogyny. It’s revved\u0026nbspup its\u0026nbspboard, sidelined founder Travis Kalanick (who still stands to make billions from the float) and boldly stated that\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Uber always does the right thing, period.\u0026nbspThe trouble is many of its drivers would beg to differ. At the leading edge of the gig economy, it is fighting legal battles on multiple fronts. Some of the early exchanges have not gone well.

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the\u0026nbspelectric car industry\u0026nbspthat will bring the technology to the mass market.But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit.Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone.The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic.\u0026nbspMr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise.Created with Sketch.

As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One hundred years on, families say the wounds still have not healed. Adam Withnall reports from AmritsarClick to followThe IndependentA painting of the Amritsar massacre, an event that became a landmark on India’s road to independenceThe walled garden at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar is unrecognisable today from the spring of 1919, when it became the scene of the single bloodiest act of violent oppression in Britain’s colonial occupation.\u0026nbspOn 13 April\u0026nbspIndia will mark the 100th anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of unarmed men, women and children by British soldiers who had been sent to quash what was believed to be a mounting rebellion.Many myths and misconceptions now surround the events that unfolded in April 1919, but the sheer scale of the brutality involved has seen the Jallianwala Bagh massacre become infamous in India as an essential landmark on the country’s path to independence.Pressure has mounted in recent months on the current British government to take the centenary as an opportunity to issue an historic apology. For the families of those killed, who say they have been suffering the consequences of the massacre for 100 years, it could finally offer some closure.\u0026nbspIt is impossible to say precisely how many people were killed in the garden on 13 April 1919. The official British toll from the time was 379, but a new, definitive count by Amritsar’s Partition Museum has come up with 501 named victims, plus an indeterminate number whose names may never be known.Britain is also to blame for the century-long controversy of AmritsarBetween 10,000 and 20,000 people had gathered in the park to attend a political meeting staged by local leaders, angry at a recent crackdown on dissent by British officials, for whom Amritsar was a key administrative centre.\u0026nbspThree days earlier, on 10 April, riots had broken out across the city during which five Europeans were killed and an influential British schoolteacher was assaulted in the street. Control of the city was handed over to the army and General Reginald Dyer was tasked with enforcing a ban on public assembly.When the meeting in Jallianwala Bagh was called the night before, organisers knew they might face trouble, and some told their wives to stay at home.Sunil Kapoor holds a portrait of his great-grandfather Lala Wasoo Mal, who was killed at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Nonetheless, at 4pm on 13 April the crowd included “a lot of people who didn’t know exactly what the meeting was, so weren’t necessarily politically involved”, says Dr Kim Wagner, a senior lecturer in British Imperial History at Queen Mary University London and author of Amritsar 1919:\u0026nbspAn Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre. “There were also children playing in the picnic area and there were pilgrims who happened to be in that space, which is right next to the Golden Temple,” he adds, referring to Amritsar’s most famous landmark for Sikh devotees.It was then that the general and his soldiers walked into the garden armed with rifles. At a later inquiry, Dyer said he would have brought in a machine gun too if it had fit in through the narrow gates.If Britain apologised and extended its welcome to the families, which have been suffering for 100 years, that would start to make for better relationsJust 30 seconds elapsed from the army’s arrival to the first rounds being fired. The guns did not fall silent for more than 10 minutes, after which 1,650\u0026nbsprounds had been shot and, in addition to those killed, more than 1,500 people were wounded.Sunil Kapoor, 42, describes this as the moment that changed his family forever. Sitting in his home in the cramped streets of downtown Amritsar, he proudly displays a portrait of his great-grandfather Lala Wasoo Mal, one of the organisers of the Jallianwala Bagh meeting and one of the first victims whose identity was confirmed by the British at the time.Kapoor’s ancestor was then aged 45 and a successful merchant, making him an influential figure in the community. He was at a smaller gathering on 12 April that preceded the Jallianwala Bagh event and helped raise 1,200 rupees – a large figure at the time – for the political cause.At around 7pm, when Mal did not return home from the park, his six-months-pregnant wife Puram went to try and find him, Kapoor says.\u0026nbsp“She was only 21 at the time. She arrived at the scene to see blood and bodies everywhere, everyone was screaming. It took her more than one hour just to find her husband.”Jaswinder ‘Jassy’ Singh has been a tour guide at the memorial garden for nine years. He says he receives many British clients, some of whom cry when they see the site (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Mal was gravely hurt, after receiving two gunshot wounds to the chest. Puram stayed by his side through the night until Rotary Club volunteers took him to hospital in the morning but, with no doctors or nurses available and no hope of emergency surgery, he died six days later.\u0026nbspPuram was too young to take on her husband’s businesses so they had to close, and she was forced to live off the family’s savings while raising Kapoor’s grandfather.“The massacre changed her,” he says. “She had to become an iron lady, to be strong for her son. And she became inspired afterwards\u0026nbspto work for the end of British rule. It was her tribute to my great-grandfather.”Puram gave evidence at the Hunter Commission, a British inquiry into the shooting that criticised some aspects of the massacre but which was overall considered a whitewash. Kapoor says she appeared at the inquiry in Lahore and told Dyer to his face that he “must pay for the sins of what he has done”. Dyer, who had not learned the local language, did not understand, Kapoor says.Kapoor met David Cameron when the then-prime minister visited Amritsar in 2013 and expressed “deep regret” for the massacre. He speaks positively of how though Cameron “could not openly apologise, his body language showed how he felt it in his soul”.Kapoor, who also heads a small foundation for the families of those killed at Jallianwala Bagh, says the centenary is a “good time” for Britain to finally deliver a full apology. And in lieu of compensation for the families, he would like to see them invited to address the British parliament in order to tell their stories and receive some form of honour on behalf of their ancestors.Amritsar after the riots\u0026nbsp(Alamy)“If Britain apologised and extended its welcome to the families, which have been suffering for 100 years, that would start to make for better relations,” he says.\u0026nbspJaswinder Singh, a tour guide who has been working at what is now the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial for nine years, stands at the spot from which the soldiers had surveyed the crowd and then started shooting.People were here for a protest. General Dyer came here with soldiers, waited for people to gather and then ordered the soldiers to fire. Many people died. The sacrifice they made here gave a spark to the minds of Indians who wanted independenceHe says many of those he shows round are amazed there hasn’t already been an apology. “I have many European clients, a lot of them British. When I bring citizens of the UK here they feel so sorry, sometimes they start crying,” he says.Britain’s official stance, reiterated in a House of Lords debate in February and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office this week, is that the government at the time condemned the massacre and that the matter has been dealt with.\u0026nbsp“Visitors expect that it must already have happened,” Singh says. “They feel that if just saying sorry can help heal the wounds here then why not just do it.” He says that if an apology were to be issued, “it would mean a lot\u0026nbspfor the whole nation”.The park was some five feet lower in 1919, and the soldiers stood on an embankment as they started firing. Now, the whole site has been raised to a uniform level, with a 1960s-installed obelisk dominating the view.\u0026nbspTourists walk the hedge-lined paths among ornate flower beds and crude topiary figures of riflemen, shading under large red stone structures none of which existed at the time of the shooting.Jallianwala Bagh memorial park is now full of tourists, as the city gears up for events to mark the centenary (Adam WithnallThe Independent)Families with selfie sticks pose for photographs next to the gaudy, pink-roofed “Martyrs’ Well”, from which legend has it 120 bodies were pulled after the massacre ended. There is no historical evidence to support this claim, but it is still repeated on a placard in four languages.The most historically significant points in the park are three walls where the brickwork is still pocked by bullet marks from the British rifles. Though highlighted by white boxes, these too have deteriorated to become almost indistinguishable, worn down by curious fingers tracing the path of the bullets.

Visitor numbers are also up, with tourists from across the country thronging through the small front gate. Vishwas Sini, 22, is visiting with his cousin from Haryana. Even before touring the site, he is aware of the basic history after studying the massacre at school – he, like many here, repeats the story of the “many bodies pulled from the well”.Naresh Parikh, 72, is visiting with his family from Gujarat. “This was a terrible act that happened here,” he says. “The British\u0026nbspgeneral stood here and killed thousands of people.”WithnallThe Independent)Gurjeet Singh, 18, is a relatively local tourist from within Punjab state. Nonetheless, he admits he knows “very little” about the incident. “Gen Dyer killed around 100 people and some people died in the well. That’s all I know,” he says.\u0026nbspTheir comments, and those of others like them, display what Wagner describes as the most persistent myth surrounding the massacre, that it was all the act of one man – the “bad apple narrative”, as he calls it, exonerating the wider system of which Gen Dyer was a part.Created with Sketch.Holi 2019 in pictures: Hindus celebrate Indian Festival of Colours Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hindu devotees raise their hands in prayer as they are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA girl smears her friend in colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India College girls pose during Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A college girl takes part in the Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A young girl smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India Colour fills the air during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India An Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaA vendor sells coloured powder known as gulal prior to Holi celebrations in Siliguru, IndiaAn Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaA hindu priest is smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India A student is covered in colour on a campus in Chandigarh, IndiaColour is sprayed from a temple during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaStudents smeared in colour dance during Holi celebrations in Chandigarh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA young man is smeared in colour by his friend during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaWomen play with powdered colours Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees raise their hands in prayer as they are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA girl smears her friend in colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India College girls pose during Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A college girl takes part in the Holi festival celebrations in Bhopal, India A young girl smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India Colour fills the air during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, India An Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaHindu devotees celebrate Holi inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaA vendor sells coloured powder known as gulal prior to Holi celebrations in Siliguru, IndiaAn Indian man is splattered with colour during Holi celebrations in Allahabad, IndiaA hindu priest is smeared with colour during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India A student is covered in colour on a campus in Chandigarh, IndiaColour is sprayed from a temple during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaStudents smeared in colour dance during Holi celebrations in Chandigarh, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaHindu devotees are sprayed with colour by a priest during Holi celebrations in Ahmedabad, IndiaA young man is smeared in colour by his friend during Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, IndiaWomen play with powdered colours Holi festival celebrations at Durgiana Temple in Armristar, India“If you do not accept that General Dyer was a one-off – and the same pernicious logic was displayed by countless other officers over the course of the empire’s history – then it rocks the entire system upon which the British rule operated.”If the park today has its shortcomings from the perspective of historical accuracy, efforts have been made to rectify the situation in the lead-up to the centenary.WithnallThe Independent)A special exhibition has been curated at the nearby Partition Museum in the city, which provides a timeline showing how the riots in the days leading up to 13 April 1919 set the stage for the massacre and, perhaps most crucially, how the bloodshed was followed by an even more restrictive period of martial law.These martial law orders, given by Gen Dyer himself, banned activities including riding a bicycle and walking down the street in groups of four or more. Those who breached the orders were stripped naked and publicly flogged.The exhibition highlights newspaper clippings from the time, including the first bulletin about the massacre that ran in Britain’s Civil and Military Gazette on the 16 April as follows: “As the crowd refused to go the order to fire was given. There were heavy casualties amongst the mob, several hundreds being killed and injured, and there was no further trouble.Instead of shying away from it, the British government should make clear that this is not the same Britain as it was 100 years ago. There is a deep, festering wound here. It is worth putting some closure on itMore importantly, the exhibition defines the Jallianwala Bagh massacre as “not an isolated event but part of a larger system of colonial oppression”.Kishwar Desai, the museum’s chair, said that the work to produce the exhibition had inspired her to write a book on the massacre last year. She said the digital materials were being shared for exhibits in Manchester, Birmingham and London as part of events around the centenary.“This was a turning point in our history,” she says. “Even Gandhi himself, who was a fan of the British up to that point –\u0026nbsponce the truth began to come out about what happened that day and in the aftermath, it became very difficult for him to continue to believe in the fairness of the British.”She says it could be considered the single worst atrocity of the Raj. “The more I researched the accounts of it, the more heartbroken I became,” she says.\u0026nbsp“These were people who had fought the war for the British, who had died for the British. And even after the massacre they are not given medical help, they are called rabid. How could they be so cruel?”Jallianwala Bagh memorial garden, the first British prime minister to do so (PA)Desai says that, other than the centenary itself, there “can be no other moment” for an apology after so many years.\u0026nbsp“I feel an apology is important – it is not for us. It is for those who died,” she says. “For me their spirit is still alive, and it is their spirit that has carried us through to where we are today.“Instead of shying away from it, they should make clear that this is not the same Britain as it was 100 years ago. There is a deep, festering wound here. It is worth putting some closure on it.”British government officials were due to address the centenary this week during\u0026nbspdebates at Westminster Hall\u0026nbspand at prime minister’s questions, but British representatives are not expected to attend any of the key anniversary events planned for Saturday.\u0026nbspSpeaking during the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday, Foreign Office minister Mark Field said he had been to India three times in the past 18 months and that he had listened to the\u0026nbsp”very, very compelling” speeches in favour of an apology.Nonetheless, he said that it was\u0026nbsp”not appropriate for me today to make the apology that I know many would wish to come”, going on to say that the government had concerns about the “financial implications” of apologising.\u0026nbspWhile the government had previously raised hopes by suggesting it was “reflecting” on the matter of an apology, it is now\u0026nbspthought unlikely that any statements will\u0026nbspdeviate far from the UK’s previous official stances.Field said Britain’s envoy to India would at some point travel to lay a wreath at the Jallianwala Bagh\u0026nbspmemorial. “It is right that we mark the centenary of this tragic event in Amritsar in the most appropriate way and that we never forget what happened,” he said. “It was a shameful episode in our history and one that we deeply regret to this day.”​Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year’s annual college draft was televised on three US networks and drew record ratings for them, averaging an impressive 5.5 million viewers over the three days of the event. The all important first round that ran in prime time on a Thursday night drew 11.2 million.\u0026nbspNow compare that to game six of the Boston Celtics – Milwaukee Bucks NBA playoff series, featuring actual competition involving actual players with something at stake. Going head to head with the draft, it drew just 2.4 million.\u0026nbspThe NBA finals in June managed 18.5 million, a mite disappointing but unsurprising given the one-sided nature of the series (the Golden State Warriors swept LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers). But still.\u0026nbspThe draft’s ratings were also comfortably ahead of the NHL’s Stanley Cup Finals, although ice hockey ranks a distant fourth in terms of the popularity of America’s major sports.\u0026nbspNow consider what the 11.2 million\u0026nbspdraft fans were actually watching when they tuned in. \u0026nbspEach of teams involved in the first round gets fully 15 minutes to make their\u0026nbspselections, which means the event can, and does, take hours to complete. It’s 10\u0026nbspminutes for rounds two and three on Friday, and five minutes for the four later rounds on Saturday.\u0026nbspThe announcement of each pick – the “action”\u0026nbsp– is over in a matter of seconds.\u0026nbspMajor League Baseball is in a funk over the pace of the game, with the ball actually in play for maybe 15 minutes over the course of more than three hours. It’s imposing rule changes in an attempt to speed things up, fearing millennials will switch off the game if it doesn’t.\u0026nbspBut compared to the NFL Draft even its most drawn-out contents look like the Olympic 100m\u0026nbspfinal.\u0026nbspHow has this happened? Why do so many American\u0026nbspsports fans, and not a few Britons, and other international NFL obsessives such as myself, spend so much time watching an event made up chiefly of lots and lots of dead space?“It’s driven by hope,” says Peter O’Reilly, the senior vice president of events at the NFL, who has been with the league for 13 years, playing a key role in making the event what it is today.“We have such parity in the NFL. OK the Patriots have been very successful, but you have so many examples of teams being rebuilt through the draft. No one wins or loses on draft day itself so everyone feels a connection and all 32 teams are involved.”That’s a point picked up by Lindy’s Sports UK\u0026nbspeditor Simon Milham. “The biggest non-event in sports is the Premier League Transfer deadline day,” he says. “A yellow tie and boundless enthusiasm, attempting to play up the merits of average players and loan deals does not cut it, I’m afraid.“The NFL Draft, on the other hand, is unique. The draft and the scouting combine before it are things of beauty. The possibility that one or two players will be able to help your team rise from a losing record to the playoffs the following season is a real one, because it happens. Parity exists in the NFL. There are fine margins and a limited 16-game regular season where every game matters.”It’s a great way to level the playing field. Every team has the prospect of coming out of the NFL Draft with a star player added to their rosterParity is, of course, a key aim of a draft that allocates the first pick of the college players who declare (they have to be three years out of high school)\u0026nbspto the worst team, and proceeds through the league in reverse order with the Super Bowl winner picking last in each of the seven rounds.\u0026nbspThis doesn’t prevent teams like the aforementioned Patriots from winning consistently, or the likes of the Cleveland Browns and the Oakland Raiders from losing most of the time. You still have to pick the right players.\u0026nbspBut it’s thanks to the draft that Browns fans can finally see some light at the end of the tunnel now that they have quarterback Baker Mayfield, last year’s number-one overall pick, running their offence.\u0026nbsp“It’s a great way to level the playing field. Every team has the prospect of coming out of the NFL Draft with a star player added to their roster. And you never know where you are going to find that player,” says Sky Sports NFL expert Neil Reynolds. “Patrick Mahomes was a first-rounder who has gone on to enjoy great success with the Kansas City Chiefs but talent can also be found in later rounds, most notably with (New England Patriots quarterback) Tom Brady (sixth round in 2000) or wide receiver Antonio Brown (sixth round in 2010).”\u0026nbspThe latter was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers but forced a trade to the Oakland Raiders in what has been an unusually entertaining start to the new NFL year.\u0026nbspO’Reilly believes that draft’s springtime setting – this year’s will kick off on 26 April\u0026nbsp– further fuels its popularity.\u0026nbspAs the days lengthen, and the sun appears more regularly, people are in the mood for a party. The draft has turned into one, particularly with its having gone mobile.\u0026nbspTaking it out of its traditional New York home and moving it around the US has proven to be a masterstroke.It was always closely watched, even when the league was building its power, following the merger with the AFL at the end of the 1960s. But it used to consist of a group of executives sitting around in a New York hotel room making phone calls\u0026nbspmade up with their teams’ logos\u0026nbsphardly the sort of thing to excite a TV executive.\u0026nbspThe decision to mobilise it, and have cities bid for it, as they do the Super Bowl, has given the NFL’s planners the facility to let their creativity run wild, as well as providing the league with a nice windfall. \u0026nbsp“Since we made the decision to leave New York and bring the draft to different fans and turn it into a big free celebration of the game, it really has taken off, drawing hundreds of thousands of fans,” says O’Reilly.\u0026nbsp“It’s a very different vibe. You see fans of all 32 teams. It is free and accessible and there’s a camaraderie. Spring is in the air and everyone is feeling good. It is this oasis that everybody gathers around.”O’Reilly points to efforts to ensure that each event “takes on the style of the market we are in”. So this year, in Nashville the music city, there will be music on stage. In 2020 when Las Vegas will be the venue, there will be events along the famous strip as the league heads into the season when the Raiders are scheduled to make the city their home.\u0026nbsp“This year you will see a different energy and more access,” O’Reilly says. “We have started to treat it like a political convention and so there will be a delegation of 50 fans from each team invited to what we call\u0026nbspthe inner circle. When a prospect is picked they will greet the fans and take a selfie with them. The draft really lets us push the envelope.”Attaching this sort of razzamatazz to what was once a relatively low key event is something few sports would be able to pull off. Most wouldn’t have even dared to try.\u0026nbspBut razzamatazz that will only get you so far with the TV people. What the league has also sought to exploit and develop is the storytelling aspect to give its broadcast partners something to draw in viewers.\u0026nbspIn many ways you can see echoes of reality TV in the way these are presented.\u0026nbspThe fan is invited to live the dream alongside young men who have invested everything into reaching the pinnacle of their sport, young men who are often celebrities through their exploits in amateur college football, just without the financial trappings that usually come with it.\u0026nbspNot for nothing did Texas QB Sam Ehlinger describe the college game, which turns over billions of dollars every year with everyone but the players getting a piece of the pie, as a “three-year unpaid internship”.\u0026nbspSays Reynolds: “There is a great deal of drama attached to each NFL Draft and it plays out in a very public way with the top prospects sitting backstage waiting to hear their name called. That can lead to some awkward on-camera moments as a player expected to go high in the draft is forced to sit and wait for sometimes hours on end before finding out where he will play in the NFL.“Also, the NFL Draft is the culmination of a lifelong pursuit for so many players. To become one of the best of the best is an amazing feeling for a young player as so few ever make it as far as the NFL. Seeing players react to hearing their names called is a wonderful thing. But the main drama comes in speculating upon which team is going to take a certain player, along with the in-draft trades that can happen throughout the seven rounds.”\u0026nbspO’Reilly says: “College football is a massive property in this country and growing beyond it. The stories of these prospects are told through their college journey. You want to see how that ends.”This can be found right down through the draft.O’Reilly\u0026nbsphighlights one of last year’s best stories that of Shaquem Griffin, who had his left hand amputated at the age of four after being born with amniotic band syndrome. Griffin ultimately went in the fifth round, making him the 141st selection overall, to the Seattle Seahawks where his brother was already playing. He led the team in tackles in 2018.\u0026nbsp“This year ABC is very focused on storytelling, talking to players moms for example\u0026nbspit starts to draw in people from a wider base,” he says. \u0026nbspThose stories are given added spice by the intrigue and skullduggery that goes on in the background. The draft wouldn’t be the draft without that.\u0026nbspFake news is a vastly overused term, but much of the what is written and broadcast in the run up to it is just that.\u0026nbspAnonymous NFL scouts\u0026nbspor team executives\u0026nbspwill be some of the prime sources of stories over the next few weeks. They’ll be quoted picking holes in the games of the top prospects, making insinuations about their characters, highlighting “red flags”.\u0026nbspQuarterback Kyler Murray, who may go first off the board, has already had his performance in interviews with teams at the scouting combine trashed.There’ll be a lot more of that sort of thing cropping up between now and the draft proper as the media indulges in the game of build ’em up, knock ’em down\u0026nbspwhen it comes to the top prospects. \u0026nbspTeams have an obvious interest in briefing against players they love in the hope of putting rivals off rivals picking higher. Some find it hard to resist indulging it.\u0026nbspFan appetites are further fuelled by the publication of\u0026nbsp“mock” drafts. There will be a new one virtually every day now the big free-agent contracts have been handed out and the draft starts to take centre stage.\u0026nbspCompilers base their predictions on a mix of whom they think teams will pick and whom they think they should pick. Sometimes major news outlets specify which one of those they are leaning towards. Sometimes they don’t. Big names in the sports media\u0026nbspwho have access to teams and their executives –\u0026nbsppeople like ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper, or the doyen of NFL journalists, NBC’s Peter King – are particularly closely watched.\u0026nbspThe rumours\u0026nbspand speculation will reach fever pitch in the few days before the event proper. There’s even more spice added to the mix on the day when teams start trading picks with each other, moving down for extra selections, or up to get the missing piece a they feel will lead to a Super Bowl appearance.Murray is the name on everyone’s lips this year. The former first-round pick of the Oakland A’s in baseball’s much lower key draft, he declared for the NFL after completing a season as starter for the University of Oklahoma, a concession afforded to him by his baseball contract. The NFL will afford him the opportunity to make more money upfront he won’t need to spend years toiling in the minor leagues and could get a big-money second contract in four years if he’s good enough. His college tape indicates that he could be, although you can never really tell. The draft is, when all is said and done, something of a crapshoot. Some teams are just better at it than others.\u0026nbspThe one that gets Murray will have an electrifying prospect on their hands, a player who is equally effective as runner as he is a passer. That’s rare. Quarterbacks usually major on one or the other but not both. \u0026nbspThe main knock on Murray is that he’s only just over 5ft 10in, which makes\u0026nbsphim the smallest starter in the league. The only other sub-6ft\u0026nbsppasser is the Seattle Seahawks’ Russell Wilson. Murray’s slight build also worries some scouts (Wilson is built like a pocket battleship).\u0026nbspMany expect him to go first overall to the Arizona Cardinals, despite their having traded up to select Josh Rosen in the first round of last year’s draft, because he’d be an ideal fit for the offence preferred by new coach Kliff Kingsbury.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.American football: Excess all areas - behind the scenes at the NFL Draft Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former New England Patriots guard Joe Andruzzi, who assisted in rescuing an injured victim from the Boston Marathon attack, speaks at the first round of the NFL draft Fans wait inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Kansas City Chiefs fans stand inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)A Miami Dolphins fan wears a U.S. flag under a Dolphins hard hat inside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Star Lotulelei, from Utah, reacts next to his wife Fuiva as they hold their daughters Pesatina, 1, left, and Arilani, 3, center, while his niece Elyena Tukuafu, 5, right, cheers after he was selected 14th overall by the Carolina Panthers during an NFL football draft party at their home (AP)New York Jets fans react in the balcony as it was announced that the Jets had selected Sheldon Richardson from the University of Missouri as the 13th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Washington Redskins fans gather outside New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Former New England Patriots player Joe Andruzzi stands on stage as a picture of Andruzzi helping a victim of the Boston Marathon bombing attacks is seen on the screen during his appearance at the 2013 NFL Draft  (Reuters)Officials carry caps of the St. Louis Rams, Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears into New York\u0027s Radio City Music Hall, before the start of the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Former New England Patriots player Joe Andruzzi (L) holds a special New England Patriots jersey honoring the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (R) during Andruzzi\u0027s appearance at the 2013 NFL Draft (Reuters)Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) stands on a stage as the Miami Dolphins unveil their new uniforms during an NFL football draft party (AP)The top NFL draft prospects pose for a group photo with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, front row center, before the first round of the NFL football draft (AP)D.J.

The Cardinals’ pick will be made by his general manager Steve Keim. But it’s hard to imagine him not getting Murray if he wants him.The other quarterback to watch is Dwayne Haskins, who fits the more traditional archetype and has a howitzer of an arm. He’s seen as an ideal fit for the more traditionally minded New York Giants who need to find a long-term replacement for Eli Manning. They have two first-round picks after trading star receiver Odell Beckham Jr to the Browns.\u0026nbspThe Miami Dolphins are also short handed at the game’s key position and Denver could do with help even after trading with the Baltimore Ravens for the declining Joe Flacco.\u0026nbspAs much as quarterbacks always get the attention, there is also an embarrassment of pass rushing riches in this year’s music\u0026nbspcity draft, headed by Nick Bosa, seen by most analysts as the best overall prospect. If he can stay healthy he’ll be frightening quarterbacks for years.\u0026nbspThe Oakland Raiders are the big X factors. They have three pick in round one, having traded two of their best players, Khalil Mack and Amari Cooper, for the first round selections of the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears.\u0026nbspNFL free agency begins Monday with big stars set to get paidBanned NFL player says he will ‘Kaepernick himself’ over marijuana lawWhich NFL team will Antonio Brown play for in 2019?The best pick from each round of the NFL draftShaquem Griffin is undoubtedly the story of the NFL draft- here’s whyNo one’s quite sure what their mercurial coach Jon Gruden and his general manager Mike Mayock, a former TV analyst, will do. They badly need a pass rusher to replace Mack. But Gruden has also spoken of his love for Murray, despite having a veteran starting QB in the form of Derek Carr. Could they trade up with the Cardinals? Gruden likes to deal and he probably will, only adding to the drama.\u0026nbspWith all that and more in the mix, O’Reilly and his bosses have good cause to feel optimistic about the ratings. There will be a lot of their beloved stories for a football crazy media to feast on, and draw viewers to one of the various live broadcasts (Sky will join in the fun through the early hours on this side of the pond).\u0026nbsp“Possibility over the proven commodity is engrained in our psychology,” reflects Milham. “Premiums are paid for potential rather than achievement in many walks of life, which is absurd when you think about it, but it’s always there.”As for the event’s future, London could one day be calling. Not soon. But the NFL’s interest in globalising the game remains strong.\u0026nbsp“We have seen and we expect to see more players coming into the draft from outside the US who are incredible athletes,” says O’Reilly.\u0026nbsp“I wouldn’t rule it out. Theres such strong interest from US in hosting. We’ve been in New York for 51 years and there are 20-plus markets wanting to host it to focus on.\u0026nbsp“But there has been so much success we have had with the games in UK, and Mexico. We certainly think about opportunities to reach international fans. It’s not imminent but its not far-fetched.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This one-woman show was performed with amusing self-possession and fierce grace by Carey Mulligan, as a woman recounting how she met her husband, and how they navigated her more successful career and having a family. Dennis Kelly’s play began deceptively light and funny, but its snark turned to harrowing tragedy via a twist that left you winded – and delivered a howl against the conditioned violence of men.This American musical was keenly awaited – and didn’t disappoint. An adaptation of Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel about her in-the-closet father who ran a funeral home, and her own journey towards coming out, it felt important to see such a story onstage – and was so very beautifully told, with book and lyrics by Lisa Kron and music Jeanine Tesori (who also scored the terrific musical Caroline, or Change, which stormed London in 2018 too after opening in Chichester last year).By American writer Clare Barron (pictured), this play followed a group of teenage dancers, with their earnest dreams, petty rivalries, and general angst. Sounds like a bad TV series… but it was so, so much more. Barron had these girls discovering their power. Power they’re thrilled by power they’re afraid of. A slippery beast, the play flirted with the supernatural and the mythical in its depiction of the transformation of puberty. Among a strong cast of adults making no attempt to disguise their adulthood, Ria Zmitrowicz was especially memorable as Zuzu. I spend more reviews than I’d like moaning about old-fashioned musical revivals that fail to tackle #problematic material. Stephen Sondheim’s musical about Bobby, whose friends harp on at him to get married, could have been one – but Marianne Elliott unlocked it with a smart, coherent approach to gender-swapped casting.A late addition: Sweat has just opened, although after rave reviews tickets are in short supply – catch it if you can before 26 January. Lynn Nottage’s play – about factory workers in Pennsylvania whose friendships and families fracture when job losses loom – was always likely to be good it won a Pulitzer, after all. But Lynette Linton’s production was ferociously good. Plumbing the emotional depths of Nottage’s heart-breaking story, it had fine, firmly controlled performances and a terrific set by Frankie Bradshaw.A game-changer, this show built up a thrilling momentum, galvanising audiences and transferring to the West End, allowing us to kick once and for all the bone-headed notion that there isn’t an audience for “black plays” into the long grass. And how: Arinze Kene’s piece of gig-theatre explored and exploded exactly the notion of a “black play”, with the mesmerising Kene playing himself as a writer struggling to work out if he’s pandering to what producers expect of him by writing “urban safari jungle s**t”.American playwright Annie Baker’s much-hyped The Flick left me a bit underwhelmed this swept me up completely. A synopsis – a fighting couple stay in a strange, kitschy B\u0026ampB filled with uncanny china dolls – doesn’t do it justice.Yes, another from the north London theatre – but what a year they had. And this was a play that really grappled with the specifics of its own setting: Ella Hickson’s meta-theatrical masterwork began with a scene set at a theatre, where a young female writer castigated a sleazy older male director. 910 2. Ear for Eye, Royal CourtThe year saw a genuine increase in the ersity of stories getting told in British theatre, and Debbie Tucker Green’s incendiary play was a pinnacle of that: brilliantly tough, absolutely necessary. A large black cast moved through elliptical scenes exposing racial prejudice and police brutality – some beautifully poetic, some just vibrating with fury.

Three for three boosters today on Falcon Heavy, what an amazing accomplishment.The Falcon Heavy soared from the space centre using the same pad that shot Apollo astronauts to the moon half a century ago and later space shuttle crews.Space is doing strange things to astronauts\u0027 bodies, Nasa study showsNearby beaches and other prime viewing spots were packed with tourists and locals eager to catch not just the launch but the rare and dramatic return of twin boosters, accompanied by sonic booms.The roads were also jammed for Wednesday night\u0027s launch attempt, which was scuttled by high wind.Because this was an upgraded version of the rocket with unproven changes, SpaceX chief Elon Musk cautioned in advance things could go wrong.But everything went well and the satellite ended up in the proper orbit.SpaceX employees at company headquarters in Southern California cheered every launch milestone and especially the three touchdowns.The Falcons have landed, Mr Musk said in a tweet that included pictures of all three boosters.From our iconic launch pads at NASAKennedy, we will continue to support the growing commercial space economy, NASA tweeted.The launch comes a year after Mr Musk put his own Tesla convertible on the initial test flight.The red Roadster - with a mannequin, dubbed Starman, likely still at the wheel - remains in a solar orbit stretching just past Mars.SpaceX plans to launch its next Falcon Heavy later this year on a mission for the US Air Force. The boosters for that flight may be recycled from this one.NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine last month suggested possibly using a Falcon Heavy - and another company\u0027s big rocket - to get the space agency\u0027s Orion capsule around the moon, minus a crew, in 2020.But the preferred method remains NASA\u0027s own Space Launch System mega rocket - if it can be ready by then.SpaceX typically launches Falcon 9 rockets. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of those single rockets strapped together.Until SpaceX came along, boosters were discarded in the ocean after satellite launches. The company is intent on driving down launch costs by recycling rocket parts.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief executive Elon Musk has long touted the standard Model 3 as a watershed for the\u0026nbspelectric car industry\u0026nbspthat will bring the technology to the mass market.But the company has struggled to figure out a way to sell it at that price and actually makes a profit.Customers who want the $35,000 Model 3 cans till get one but they will have to go into a Tesla showroom or make the purchase over the phone.The latest announcement is the fourth round of changes to Tesla’s pricing and retail strategy, which has appeared increasingly erratic.\u0026nbspMr Musk’s company had said it would shut almost all of its showrooms to focus on online sales before an about turn just 10 days later in which it said most locations would stay open but prices would rise.Created with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Now the focus has switched again. As part of the changes,customers will be able to lease a Tesla for the first time but with a big caveat: they don’t get the option of buying the car once their lease is up.Why? Because Tesla wants to use them in its planned ride-hailing network which it hopes will take on the likes of Uber and Lyft.All Tesla vehicles now come with the Autopilot driver-assistance system as standard, the company said in a blog post.\u0026nbspThe Model 3 with Standard Plus battery range used to cost $37,500, plus $3,000 for Autopilot. It now costs $39,500 with Autopilot included.The company launched its long-awaited $35,000 version of the car in February to great fanfare. Now the least expensive version available to order online is the Standard Range Plus Model 3 at $39,000.Last week, Tesla reported its biggest ever drop in vehicle sales. The electric car maker revealed the first quarter of 2019 saw 31 per cent less deliveries than the previous quarter, representing a fall of nearly 30,000 vehicles.It is the first time in nearly two years that Tesla has experienced a quarter-to-quarter sales decline but still represents a significant increase from the first quarter of 2018.Tesla\u0027s Model 3 proved to be the firm\u0027s most popular car in the first three months of the year Tesla, representing 50,900 sales. The remainder of sales were made up of Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Uber\u0026nbspsaid it expects operating expenses to “increase significantly in the foreseeable future” as it continues its expansion.\u0026nbspIn a filing with US regulators that revealed its financial health for the first time, Uber also said that its rapid growth has recently slowed.The company had 91 million\u0026nbspaverage monthly users across its platforms, including food-delivery app Uber Eats at the end of 2018 but growth slowed to 33.8 per cent from 51 per cent a year earlier.Those users generated sales of $11.3bn last year, 42 per cent higher than in 2017.Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a letter: “Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight built a stronger and more cohesive management team and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term.”Uber has come up against increasing resistance from local taxi operators and regulators around the world, and faced a number of scandals and legal hurdles that have the potential to drag on its future growth.In the UK it has been locked in a legal fight over whether its drivers should be classified as workers employed by the company or self-employed people who are not entitled to rights such as holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber drivers protest on the first day of Uber’s Court of Appeal caseUber’s blockbuster listing on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to raise about $10bn to help fund further expansion.Its closest rival, Lyft, listed its shares at the end of March but has seen its valuation crash 15 per cent since then, suggesting investors’ appetite for risky, loss-making technology firms may be drying up.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

pottery found at the site of a medieval village near Houghton which was discovered during the A14 upgrade project between Cambridge and HuntingdonSteve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: Just as they\u0027re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special significance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about 4,500 years ago.Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the \u0027dog people\u0027.While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.The Cuween Dog was about the size of a large collie and had features similar to those of a European grey wolf.Historians believe it can reveal information about ceremonial practices and the symbolic significance of canines in Late Neolithic Orkney as well as the appearance of domestic dogs in the third millennium BC.Last year, HES published 3D digital models of the chambered cairns to better reveal the sophisticated structure of the monuments to the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a 3D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.The canine reconstruction is part of this wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney\u0027s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Neolithic Britons came from across country for mass national feastsAncient British stone circles were used for ‘Neolithic parties’The latest work was originally created in clay using traditional methods, with a 3D print of the Cuween Hill skull as the base to build the anatomy on to.It was then cast in silicone and finished with the fur coat resembling a European grey wolf, as advised by experts.HES said the work will go on display in Orkney this year.Ms Thornton, who trained in facial reconstruction methods at the University of Dundee, said: This reconstruction has been a particularly interesting project to be involved in, as it marks the first time I\u0027ve employed forensic methods that would usually be used for a human facial reconstruction and applied these to an animal skull.The earth mother of all neolithic discoveriesThis brought its own set of challenges, as there is much less existing data relating to average tissue depths in canine skulls compared to humans.Cuween Hill chambered cairn - built between 3000 and 2400 BC - is an example of a Neolithic chamber tomb.It has four cells opening off a central chamber, which is accessed down a passage.The structure suggests there was a belief in an afterlife 5,000 years ago, with evidence of complex burial rites.In all, 24 dog bones and skulls were discovered when the Neolithic site was excavated in 1901, as well as the remains of eight humans.Only the best news in your

TSSA union general secretary and a Corbyn ally Manuel Cortes told The Independent: “Overwhelming numbers of Labour voters want an end to the Brexit madness. Labour must give these people hope. We must promise to put any deal back to the people for a confirmatory vote.“I really fear that if we don’t pledge this in our European election manifesto, we will be squeezed by the likes of the Greens and the SNP, and some of our voters will simply stay at home.”The left-wing MP and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis added: “The world is watching, and Labour needs to stand its ground against the Tories and against the centrist parties.“And we have to be clear about the role of Europe in that, by arguing for Remain and transform. That’s why I’m glad that Labour’s policy has shifted in recent weeks and we can go into these elections arguing for a confirmatory public vote.”But while some inside the leader’s office see the ground to be gained in taking a stronger line on a referendum, there is still nervousness from others close to the leader and outright opposition from some shadow cabinet members.Party chair\u0026nbspIan Lavery has twice defied the Labour whip to abstain on votes in which the front bench backed\u0026nbspa new referendum on Brexit and is said to have warned Mr Corbyn he could go down in history as the leader who “split the party”.At the launch of Mr Farage’s new Brexit Party on Friday, the ex-Ukip leader said he expected to steal voters who backed Leave in 2016 from the Labour Party, which he called “pretty much pro-Remain”.Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn’s party is also under pressure from the referendum-backing Change UK, set up by ex-Labour MP Chuka Umunna and a handful of other defectors in protest over antisemitism and their former party’s Brexit stance. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBoth Mr Farage’s group and Change UK are expected to try to use the European elections to break through and challenge the dominance of the established Westminster parties.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But now we’re holding European elections, not knowing whether MEPs will take their seats or for how long. It’s extraordinary,” he said.“We cannot remain stuck in this loop for another six months. I urge the prime minister not to see this extension as another chance to flog her dead deal.”Tories face election drubbing as support ‘drops to six-year low’May could remain PM until October Brexit deadline, Hammond hintsDon’t be fooled by the extension, no-deal Brexit is still on the cardsMr Corbyn added in his speech: “When the prime minister announced that she wanted to speak to me to find a Brexit compromise, of course I agreed.“I didn’t have any advance notice of her invitation, by the way. I found out when I heard it on TV, like everyone else.“It’s scandalous that it came so late in the Brexit process, not at the 11th hour, not even at five to midnight, but at five past midnight after she missed her own deadline of\u0026nbsp29\u0026nbspMarch.Tories face election drubbing as support ‘drops to six-year low’“Nevertheless, we’re engaging in the talks in a serious and constructive way. But we must see those red lines moving and we must see real compromise.”During his address\u0026nbspthe Labour leader also referred to the Westminster political system as “another world”, as he criticised the “alien language” and arcane procedure.“When the focus of our national conversation is dominated by baffling procedures in parliament and when nothing seems to change, I understands why people feel frustrated,” he said.“People watch the back and forth in parliament. They see the arcane procedure and hear the alien language. It’s another world. For me that’s not what real politics is about.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itAsked whether the 30 June date was still a red line for the prime minister, the Tory source said: “She understands that the Conservative Party feels a sense that new leadership is required for the second phase of negotiations. That was the commitment she gave to her parliamentary colleagues and that’s one she stands by.”Speaking at a 2.30am press conference after talks closed, the PM again blamed her own MPs for the delay, telling reporters: Over the last three months I have voted three times to leave the European Union. If sufficient members of parliament had voted with me in January we would already be out of the European Union.Back in London Ms May’s detractors were already setting themselves up for a fight, with former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that the PM must be forced out of the job if she returns with a long extension.Merkel backs ‘longer’ Brexit delay than requested by Theresa May“I hate to say this but the reality is if we end up going and accepting a year-long, or even a nine-month extension, I think we’re going to have egg all over our face,” he told Channel 4 News at the same time as the PM\u0026nbspaddressed EU leaders over the channel in Brussels.“It’s time for us to bite the bullet and say, look, we can’t do this any longer, we have to make a change.“The whole thing is an utter car crash and I think what has to be established now is I think the cabinet has to have a moment with the prime minister and say this can’t go on, I’m afraid, it really can’t go on.”But the prime minister’s allies simultaneously rallied around her. Justice secretary David Gauke said that there was no rush to change leader, and that “it may well be the last thing we need as a country is a leadership election”.Mr Gauke told BBC Radio 5Live’s Emma Barnett programme: “If it helps the country she will walk, if it helps the country for her to stay she will stay. She will do what she thinks is the right thing for the country.”Ahead of a late night summit in Brussels EU leaders signalled that they were looking at giving the prime minister an extension of either nine or 12 months. Donald Tusk, the European Council president, has suggested that such an extension could have a flexible end date, and terminate shortly after the withdrawal agreement is approved by the UK parliament.UK could have ‘a say’ in customs union after Brexit, Varadkar saysBrexit secretary admits EU now \u0027in control\u0027 of UK\u0027s departureDUP brands May\u0027s Brexit talks with European leaders ‘humiliating\u0027After pressure from France, which argued strongly against a long extension until 2020, the Council agreed to a slightly shorter delay until October with a stock-taking exercise in June. The\u0026nbspreview at the start of the summer is\u0026nbspexpected to\u0026nbspassess UK co-operation during and after May’s European elections.European Council president Donald Tusk said at a 2am press conference: “Let me finish with a message to our British friends: this extension is as flexible as I expected, an a little bit shorter than I expected, but it’s still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time.”He added: “I think it’s always best to have a piece of something than all of nothing.”The new 31 October deadline also aligns with the end of the current Commission presidency. Speaking alongside Mr Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker joked: I like the decision we have taken tonight because the end date has been fixed on the 31 October. I have to leave my job on 1 November. So my guess will be that we won\u0027t have an overnight session because if we have one I\u0027ll have to leave the meeting at midnight.Ms May is\u0026nbspunderstood to have given a one-hour presentation to the 27 leaders setting out her case for an extension to June 30, with a break clause allowing the UK to leave as soon as her Brexit deal is ratified by MPs.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not only were we right, but the Department of Health plainly must now accept it too.The Government’s own estimates show that outlawing TV junk food ads before pm will cut just two calories a day from a kid’s diet. Two! Half a Smartie. A minuscule fraction of the , a day a ten-year-old takes in.Banning buy-one-get-one-free deals on snacks and fizzy drinks would save eight calories a day. Moving “junk food” away from checkouts  Nine.These are negligible amounts, even added together.And they lay bare the arrogant folly of a Conservative Party which, in its panic over obesity and NHS resources, has surrendered to the middle-class public health zealots who spend their lives ­tut-tutting at working people’s grub.They imposed a tax on sugary drinks despite no firm evidence that it has cut obesity in any country which has tried it. It didn’t work there. It won’t here.Nor is there any basis to believe banning fast food ads on the Tube will reduce one single person’s weight. It’s a theory. A hunch. Feeble politicians deciding “something must be done”.Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies wants new taxes on chocolate and crisps. She must now be ignored. Tory nanny-statism has NO measurable ­benefits but does substantial harm.It saddles everyone with higher shopping bills. It damages food businesses. It earns the Government a reputation for obsessive interference in our lives which should never be a Tory trait.Few except Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss seem to grasp it. Buta new generation of Tory politicians is keen to take power they had better join her on the right side of this argument.Because it’s all very well them trying to attract younger voters.They won’t have a prayerthey still insist on being meddling busybodies and the enemies of personal choice.FOR more proof of this Government’s ­woeful paralysis, look no further than the “new” cap on Town Hall chiefs’ payoffs.Of course it’s right to slash them. And £, of public money is still generous.But this limit was unveiled four years ago. We are on our second Prime Minister since then, and soon to get a third. A referendum and election have come and gone. Still this policy is not in place.Even now we must wait, pending another “consultation”.

To say that leaving the EU, which they used to claim had negligible impact on our sovereignty, is in fact too hard. That it’s “undeliverable”.Remainer politicians told .million Leavers a pack of lies about honouring their vote. Now, as they hoped, Brexit is “delayed” again.

The law was on their side. Remainer tricks could not stop them. They fatally rejected the one viable deal, thinking a harder one was days away.It was all cobblers. They missed what everyone outside their bubble could see: they were outnumbered by Remainers who will scrap Brexitthey can.Yet the ERG still won’t back Theresa May’s deal.

So, the pressure on her will grow.”Mr Farage will warn that British politics “is broken” and vow to usher in a “fresh start” to when he launches his new Brexit Party in Coventry today.He told The Sun: “The European elections are a first step in changing the political system.

Something has got to give.”He added: “I think Theresa May has been the most useless and dishonest Prime Minister in our history.“I think we can expect to receive Tory support.”One Tory MP warned: “The Brexit party poses an existential threat to the Conservative Party.”Tory associations have warned that thousands of activists have effectively gone on strike in fury at the Brexit delay.They have refused to knock on doors to campaign for the party in the looming elections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there are risks to this approach.Labour coming out for a second referendum would cost them in their Leave-voting seats and in the places they must win to form a government.Of the  seats in England and Wales that Corbyn needs to get a majority,  voted Leave. While  of his  most vulnerable seats backed Brexit.Corbyn’s other option is to do a deal with Mrs May.If he pushed her into accepting a customs union, then he would further ide the Tories.A deal would also mean Britain was out and that Corbyn could fight the next election on the domestic issues he cares about most.As one Cabinet Minister puts it: “There is an appeal for Corbyn to support something. He can create fissures within the Tory party, look serious, andhe becomes PM he doesn’t have to deal with all this crap.” But there are big risks to this approach, too.If Corbyn helped a Brexit deal over the line, there would almost certainly be more defections from the Labour Party.It would also produce a rallying cry for Chuka and Co.They would be able to tell pro-Remain votersthat Labour had betrayed them, that it could have stopped Brexit but chose not to.This is a finely balanced decision for Corbyn. But he doesn’t have long to make up his mind. If the Tories take a pasting in either next month’s local elections or the European elections, then Mrs May could be gone as Tory leader — replaced by a Brexiteer.This new Tory leader would immediately break off talks with Corbyn.If he wants to do a deal, he needs to DO IT SOON. Which way will he go Well, one of those involved tells me that the situation in the talks is “less negative than people think”. But the likelihood of these talks producing something remains low. What would make a deal attractive to Jeremy Corbyn would make it unpalatable to Theresa May.Another complication is that, as one Cabinet Minister points out, “It’s quite finely balanced that a May Corbyn deal could get through” the Commons as Labour MPs passionately in favour of a second referendum would vote against it, as would Tories who viscerally oppose a customs union.The depressing truth is that there is now a growing risk that the Tory party doesn’t deliver Brexit AND doesn’t stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting to Number . This would be an epic failure.Unless the Tory hold-outs decide to back the existing deal when they come back from their holidays, this danger will become increasingly real.CONSERVATIVE MPs are taking a second look at Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary has more critics on the Tory benches than any other leadership contender.But the party’s precipitous fall in the polls is making Tories reconsider.If they are losing a quarter of their support to pro-Brexit parties, who is better placed to win those voters back than the man who led the Leave campaign  Boris’s campaign is more organised than it was.The arrival of the former MP James Wharton has helped and, as one of those on the team puts it, MPs are now “petried about their seats” and so more prepared to swallow their doubts about Boris.A decade ago, one of those who knows the Tory party best told me that the Tories would only turn to Boris when they were - down with  minutes to go.They now are three down and that means Boris is back in contention for the premiership.MRS MAY might still be in the post. But make no mistake, the Tory leadership contest is under way.We have now even got ministers saying on live TV who they will back when there’s a contest.This week, the Treasury Minister Mel Stride got  or so Tory MPs who want Michael Gove to run for leader together with their potential candidate for drinks.One of those present tells me it is increasingly likely that Gove will run.THE big decision on whether to press ahead with HS has to be taken in December.But with a change of Tory leader likely to happen before then, the project is in trouble.Scrapping the scheme would give any new PM billions to spend on other projects, such as better transport within and between northern cities and proper, digital infrastructure for the whole of the UK.There’ll be no shortage of candidates making this case come a Tory leadership contest.THE six-month Brexit extension is the wrong .It is neither short enough to force MPs to make up their minds about what they want, nor is it long enough to allow for a new Prime Minister and a general election campaign.Emmanuel Macron wanted to give Britain a short extension to force a decision, Angela Merkel favoured one long enough to give the UK time to come up with a new path. In the end, they compromised on this medium- extension.“Two potential routes out and they went to the middle one that delivers us to nowhere,” laments one Cabinet Minister.There is a real danger that the Brexit drt continues for another six months. This useless Parliament knows what it doesn’t want, but can’t say what it would actually accept.If this happens, Britain will end up back at the EU Council in October asking for a THIRD EXTENSION.This would be ridiculous. But one Secretary of State predicts that this is “where we’ll probably end up and at that point Macron’s view will probably prevail”.The French President might be so full of himself that you think he’s going to burst.But he’s right that only a HARD DEADLINE will force our MPs to make up their minds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One, without irony, said it was a “no-brainer”.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire brainlessly obliged. Their mistake became obvious too late.Politicians forever come a cropper with knee-jerk tweets.Like Tory chairman Brandon Lewis demanding Boris Johnson apologise for burka remarks most of Britain then backed.MPs are hooked on it and presumably imagine Britain is too.But political Twitter is a bubble, not the national conversation.A visit to any town or city outside the M would tell them that.And the Tories and Labour might then begin to grasp the white-hot rage felt by millions over the abysmal state of our politics and MPs’ infantile tribal games.WE hope the Tory ERG have a long, hard and sober think over their Easter break.They may want to be remembered as heroic holdouts against a softish Brexit.Butthe decision of .million ­people is overturned, and the Tories are ousted by hard-left extremists who inflict poverty on Britain, it will not be the Remainer MPs history recalls.Fair or not, it will be two dozen ERG members who had the sole viable Brexit deal in their grasp and threw it away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, it’s quite the opposite.For a start, not one recipient seems grateful.But more importantly, we are almost skint ourselves, so not exactly in a position to be flash with our cash.Are you aware that we have to pay £BILLION A YEAR simply in interest, servicing our own debt.So that is before we pay off any of the actual debt.So spending £billion a year on an ill-thought-through and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target seems nonsensical to me.A couple of recent examples of the kind of thing that some foreign aid is spent on once it has been allocated include fixing potholes in Pakistan and India and helping an all-female pop group dubbed the Ethiopian Spice Girls.But another story this week shines even more light on how misguided our foreign aid spending is.Auditors investigating the way £.billion was spent through charities found poor management practices and delays by the Department for International Development, which was described as “dithering”, risked completely wasting the money.The net result is that these foreign aid projects — which spend ten per cent of our aid budget — are “unlikely to achieve lasting change”.So not only are we throwing money we can not afford at a problem that is not ours, that money may as well be flushed away for all the good it is doing.How galling is that  Just to reiterate, we are talking about a whopping £.billion here — not just a few thousand quid.This is enough money to change lives here profoundly and on a very grand scale.But that brings me back to my first point: Why on earth are we giving away such a colossal amount of money when we really are not in a position to do so And it was recently revealed that more than million people in the UK are living in poverty.By the way, that figure includes .million children who are living below the breadline — and suffering badly as a result.More than half of them will not be able to get themselves out of poverty and will find themselves trapped in a cycle that goes on for years, according to a new measure for tracking poverty that has brought together specialists from across the political spectrum.The scary thing is that even a relatively comfortable income is no guarantee that people can meet basic material needs —that income is eaten up by unavoidable weekly outgoings.And this problem is getting worse, not better. By - the proportion of children living in relative povertyis on course to hit  per cent — exceeding the previous record high of  per cent in the early s.This could mean an extra one million children living in poverty in the next five years.In other words, we have a serious problem on our hands.Many people will no doubt blame austerity for the increase in poverty over the past few years. And yes, sure, it is true that the cuts and freezes to welfare and disability benefits have had an impact.But just imagine the ways in which £.billion could begin to make a massive material impact on the lives of poverty-stricken people in this country.I believe that we should reserve some money — a couple of billion, say — for overseas catastrophes, such as tsunamis.But other than that, let’s stop giving away money that could be much, much better spent at home.I KNOW Jeremy Kyle has interviewed some dubious characters over the years, but the biscuit was well and truly taken this week by Georgina Clarke.This -year-old mother is so obsessed with cosmetic surgery that she allowed her daughter Kayla, aged , to dance for, and sleep with, a “sugar daddy” who then paid for both of them to have plastic surgery.Why does an -year-old “need” cosmetic surgery, you may ask.Kayla blamed the pressures of social media, as well as glamorous celebrities such as the Kardashians for making her want bigger boobs and plumped-up lips.But instead of reassuring her daughter that she didn’t need surgery, this mother gave it her blessing.Georgina justied this to Jeremy by saying she found surgery “quite addictive”, and revealed – unsurprisingly –  she is still not happy with her own look.It’s easy to wonder whether that therefore means she’ll be encouraging her daughter to wine, dine and dance for a few more older men.As mothers, we are meant to give our daughters self-esteem and confidence, not encourage them to surgically “improve” themselves.And for a mother to encourage her daughter to fund that surgery, as well as her own, by sleeping with a dirty old man The only explanation is that her moral compass is severely and sadly lacking.I can still remember going to watch Grease when it came out the first time. I got dressed up in a boob tube and skin-tight trouserswhen I was all of nine years old.And I can’t wait to see the prequel, although I probably won’t wear the boob tube this time around.Mind you, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that over the years so... never say never.WE all have moments of fantasising about just how much better le would bewe won the lottery and never had to work again.But for all too many people, realising their wildest dreams with a win turns out to be a le change that’s incompatible with the le they have lived so far.Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Colin and Christine Weir, have turned out to be the latest lottery casualties.This week they announced they’re orcing – eight years after scooping the £million jackpot.Colin, , and Christine, , took home the EuroMillions British record in  and had been married for  years before their recent split.In fact, let’s all take a moment to count our lucky stars that we haven’t won the lottery this week.IT’S hard to believe that Lori Loughlin and her husband could be facing  years in prison and fines of more than a million dollars for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern Calornia.I mean, yes, I know that bribing your child’s way through university is dishonest, dishonourable and not at all admirable.But  years in prison for doing so That does seem a little harsh.Justice has been served and his mum was given a -month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a -day rehabilitation activity.Far worse, though, she has now lost her son, who has been adopted into another family. Thank God for adopters.A judge told the woman – who can’t be identied for legal reasons – that leaving her son in such a state was “reprehensible” and “goes against the instinct of any caring mother”, which is true.Anyone who becomes a parent needs to understand that kids are forever.I speak from experience, by the way – mine are  and  and there’s still no independence in sight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past few weeks the EU has done just that to Theresa May.Only the dference is, we keep being flogged not because we tried to escape the EU but we failed to even TRY to escape.After all, we could have escaped with no deal on March , then again on April  and now we will have to put up with more floggings as we delay our departure until October.In the midst of this humiliating and embarrassing national failure, just when you think it can’t get worse, up pops the Chancellor glibly saying there will be a vote on holding another Brexit referendum and that the Government agree on a lot with Labour.This flies in the face of the fact that, in marginal seats around the country, Conservatives are aghast the Government wants to do a deal with Labour.Remember, this is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which wants a Customs Union, alignment with the EU single market and a second referendum.It’s BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.Worse, Corbyn’s brand of anti-British, Venezuelan-supporting Marxism is the single biggest threat to the UK’s future prosperity.Intriguingly, the Chancellor’s statement contradicts the Government’s previous view. After all, the Prime Minister used to say Corbyn wasn’t fit to be Prime Minister.The negotiating strategy it adopted has been aimed at trying to make an example of the UK to stop other countries thinking of leaving.At the heart of this has been their determination to insist on a deeply damaging set of proposals for the Northern Ireland border.It is these demands which have made it impossible to get a deal through the House of Commons. Those who believe in the importance of the union of the United Kingdom recognise the need to stand up for the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The EU’s arrogant refusal to continue negotiating a better way forward, using alternative border arrangements, is a deliberate attempt to interfere in the nature of the UK.In this they are supported by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose somewhat pompous elitism is in stark contrast to his poll ratings — which have been so low you could slide them under a snake.Instead of confronting the EU, prepared to leave by rejecting its deal, the Prime Minister has instead taken a dangerous decision.This is to agree to the EU demand for a longer extension, up to October  — a further  days of membership.This isn’t just a delay until October, it comes with strings attached. The EU demands that we fight next month’s Euro elections.This will be an utter disaster.At a cost to taxpayers of more than £million, and around £billion each month in EU membership fees, we would elect MEP’s who would have to leave office when we leave the EU in October.These will be elections no one really wants and would go down in history as the most pointless and expensive electoral mistake.There was a time when the Prime Minister had the sympathy of the nation. People used to give her the benefit of the doubt.They recognised that in a Parliament stuffed with an overwhelming majority of anti-Brexit Remainers, and with a Remain-leaning Cabinet, it was dficult for her.Most people I have spoken to hung on to the pledge the PM made to leave the EU on March .They remembered her constant refrain that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and persuaded themselves such a pledge would be delivered on.That all changed when we didn’t leave on March . Gone is that sense of sympathy and trust and in its place is a growing sense of betrayal. The country is crying out for strong leadership.Yet it is not too late. We can, even at this eleventh hour, rediscover our belief in the UK as a self-governing nation, the world’s fth largest economy and one of the most influential.After all, despite all the Project Fear warnings, while the Eurozone is mostly in recession the UK’s economy is growing, employment is at a record high and youth unemployment at a near-record low.No, we don’t need to fear anything.The Prime Minister has already said she is stepping down. She needs to heed the concerns, including those of her MPs, and not let this drag out.What better legacy than one where she recognises the optimism of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.They instinctively know that our best days are ahead of us. Now is the time to refuse to be bullied by the EU any more — no more national humiliation.If the EU won’t change their deal, she should say the UK will simply leave.Now that’s a great legacy, Prime Minister. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Firstly, they have a lot of top female obstetricians and midwives and she really wants a woman to deliver her baby.“The other is because they support alternative birthing methods and give the parents a lot of choice before, during and after the birth.“It is also, of course, very private, and seen as one of the safest places Meghan can give birth.”Buckingham Palace said this week that Meghan and Harry will not immediately share news of the birth of their son or daughter as they want to celebrate the arrival privately first.Royal bodyguards will be present when Meghan goes into labour — and security experts are believed to have “scoped” the maternity unit and given it their seal of approval.The maternity suite’s website says: “The Kensington Wing is designed to be a comprehensive maternity unit with private consultation rooms for your antenatal appointments, a medical day assessment unit, three labour rooms, a water-birthing suite, nursery, post-natal en-suite bedrooms and a luxury postnatal suite.“Our delivery rooms are furnished with all the equipment necessary to monitor you and your baby during labour and birth.“We encourage choices in birth position and can provide birth-balls, beanbags, floor mats, birthing stools and birthing pools. We offer all the services you would expect in a luxury hotel.”The Kensington wing — which is also where Cheryl Tweedy gave birth to her son with Liam Payne in  — offers smoked salmon for breakfast, £ bottles of champagne and private rooms with en suite bathrooms, TVs, fridges and wi.It also boasts , works of art, -hour room service, and complimentary toiletries.Obstetricians are available  hours a day and the suite offers one-to-one midwe care in labour. A consultant neonatologist carries out baby checks and there is full post-natal physiotherapy advice.Human rights lawyer Amal gave birth to daughter Ella and son Alexander at the Kensington wing in June .Our source added: “Meghan and Amal have grown extremely close.“Amal has become one of her dearest UK-based friends, and Meghan looks up to her and respects her.“She is listening to Amal and mum Doria a lot in the run-up to the birth. Amal’s influence can be seen in the choice of hospital and also in how Meghan plans to care for the baby after birth.”Meghan and Harry have recently moved into Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate while Amal and Ocean’s Eleven actor George live  miles away in Sonning, Berks.The Clooneys were star guests at the royal ­wedding in Windsor last May, while Amal was one of Meghan’s pals who attended her lavish baby shower in New York in February.Meghan and Harry have reportedly acted on Amal’s advice and hired celebrity nanny Connie Simpson — who has worked for A-list couples including Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake.Known as Nanny Connie, the childcare expert assisted with George and Amal’s twins for a short period and is set to work as a “family coach” — helping out along with Doria.In a previous interview, Connie said: “I’ll tell Meghan that in all the things you can give a person, the most important thing you can give is yourself and your love.“Meghan’s going to be overwhelmed. She needs to enjoy the moment and this special time with her baby.She’s going to be overwhelmed with information and ‘lookie-loos’ peering into her le. So I’ll say enjoy those ­subtle moments.”Meghan’s mother Doria — who also played a signicant role in the royal wedding — plans to be at the birth.The yoga teacher has told friends in the US she will be away “for a long while” as she comes here to help out the new parents.Our insider explained: “Meghan has been speaking to Doria a lot and is pleased she will have her by her side.“Meghan will be in charge but will be very grateful for her mother’s help and advice. She is not in touch with her father at the moment, but her bond with Doria is extremely strong and important to her.”Meghan and Prince Harry have been spotted at a posh wellbeing store as they prepare for their new arrival.Ilapothecary in Kensington offers “mother-to-be massages” with oils and balms and treatments focusing on encouraging “hormonal equilibrium”.And Meghan has enjoyed its “gong therapy” — a wellness trend that involves listening to the sounds that are rich in “harmonic frequencies”. The treatment — established in the US and growing in popularity here — “bathes” users in the meditative sounds of gongs and tuning forks.Practitioners claim the gongs have “vibrational energy” that reduces tension, and blood pressure, aids peaceful sleep and is calming for the unborn child.Meghan is expected to use similar calming techniques during the birth, including chanting routines, healing crystals and aromatherapy.But it’s not just royals and celebs who turn to New Age routines to help them with pregnancy and childbirth.Mum-of-two Natasha Harding used some of the methods when she had her son Zak in June  — and she reckons they will suit the Duchess of Sussex too.The -year-old writer from West Malling, Kent, said: “If it’s what Meghan wants to do, she won’t regret it.”“I used to tell people, ‘If I ever have a baby, I will ask for all the drugs they can give me.’“But when the time came I started reading up on what would happen.”To prepare herself for a natural birth, Natasha did yoga every day and used self-hypnosis to disconnect from the pain she would experience when her baby arrived.She also used healing crystals, massages and practised breathing for an hour a day to help her keep calm at the birth.During labour in her bathroom, Natasha burnt calming lavender oil.And she only had two puffs of gas and air before little Zak arrived weighing a healthy .lbs.Natasha, who is also mum to five-year-old daughter Lexi, said: “After Zak was born, I remember thinking I could do it all over again.“It will be amazingMeghan does the same thing.

They are also handed ­benefits at taxpayers’ expense to ease their re-entry into the country they only recently treated with contempt.This wishy-washy “detox” therapy is supposed to rid these brainwashed fanatics of their evil, anti-Western beliefs and convert them into upstanding citizens.Ministers think it is then fine for these extremists to be quietly resettled into society.But this softly, softly approach is not only sending out a dubious message about justice. It may also be allowing manipulative fanatics who still harbour murderous resentment against the West back into our midst.In one case, a British-born woman claimed during therapy that she only learned her jihadi husband was taking her to Syria while they were on their ­honeymoon.She later confessed that she had been fully aware of such plans long before and lied about her own sympathies.If others like her and hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who did the course, are making a mockery of the system by pulling the wool over the eyes of the so-called experts, how can any of us feel safe It is time such people were treated for what they are, criminals and terrorists.The woman in her s told a therapist she only made the decision to live in Syria while on honeymoon. Later she said she knew she was going there from the start.Independent MP John Woodcock said: “It’s worthwhile looking for people who genuinely repent and can then play a positive role in de-radicalising others.”BRITAIN’S judges — with their usual obsession with “human rights” — aren’t known for acting tough on Islamic extremists.So it’s extraordinary that a judge would round on a provider of the Government’s so-called tough-on-terror programme.It exists to “deradicalise” Islamists,such a conversion were possible.Its attendees include Anjem Choudary, right, who has been linked to more than  jihadists.It is even suggested by some on the liberal left as the solution for jihadi bride Shamima Begumshe ed. She said seeing heads in bins didn’t bother herthey were from “enemies of Islam”.Yet the counsellors meant to deliver the conversion scheme are clearly eager to believe the jihadi lies they should be challenging, risking the safety of us all.Keeping Britain safe from extremists is tough.

They have flats here called trap houses which they rent.There’s lots of money here which is why they are coming to sell.Other locals flagged concerns the area would go downhill as it became increasingly plagued with drugs.The problem has become so bad that Crimestoppers and Cheshire Police launched a campaign to highlight the dangers of the operations in the area.The social media campaign will particularly target  areas, including Runcorn, Winsford, Chester, Ellesmere Port, Alsager, Crewe, Middlewich, Nantwich, Northwich, Knutsford, Sandbach, Warrington and Congleton.The advantage to dealers is they can sell drugs outside the area they live in - often impoverished towns - and therefore reduce the risk of getting caught.A criminal group may also target a vulnerable person living in an area outside of London and other major cities and take over their home as a base to sell drugs from.Boys aged - are the most often targeted, however girls can also be exploited, often starting a relationship with a gang member that can lead to sexual and domestic violence.Adults who are drug addicts or have learning dficulties are also targeted.Signs to look out for that someone is involved in County Lines activity:** According to Childrens SocietyLast year, Crimestoppers received , pieces of information from the public in Cheshire, up from , the previous year - with the majority regarding drug dealing and supply.And the towns Deputy Mayor Andrew Malloy admitted there was a problem, adding: The bigger thing is people see Knutsford as affluent so they see money and try to target it.Sergeant Rob Anderson, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: Keeping people and our community safe from organised crime is our priority in Widnes. Last week we worked really hard to disrupt those who deal drugs in our community while also protecting those exploited by their activity.This type of criminality often means vulnerable adults and children are targeted by criminals to deliver and deal drugs on their behalf after being criminally exploited, coerced and manipulated.Breaking this cycle is very dficult and while we work with our partners it is important the public support us by knowing how to spot signs of criminal exploitation.We listen to the public when they provide us with information and I would encourage the local community to always keep an eye out andyou feel something isn’t right report it to us on ."},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror brexit hidden","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: Brexit has hidden our childrens plightThe run-up to the referendum, the referendum, the aftermath – all have sucked the oxygen out of politics - and our children are sufferingShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR Newsopinion \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBrexit has dominated the political agenda for years now. The run-up to the referendum, the referendum, the aftermath – all have sucked the oxygen out of politics. This week’s ruling to extend the Brexit deadline until Halloween has not solved the problem. But what it has done is allow other neglected issues some time in the limelight. That’s why today’s news about schools is so important. Because as all our collective interest and effort has been focussed on Brexit, some terrible things have been allowed to happen. Only one in six new-built schools has a sprinkler system installed. That’s a statistic that should shock us all. It was a government pledge to make things safer – but one they have ignored.    The Grenfell tragedy should have taught us all about the importance of proper fire safety. In the same week, we learned in a survey carried out by the National Education Union that  per cent of teachers believe poverty is a factor in pupil’s learning. Some of the responses in the survey are horrying – parents struggling to make ends meet, high rents, homelessness and insecurity. We have stories of children going to school who have not eaten for days. Some arrive shivering in thin coats, leaking shoes, no socks. Food banks, once rare, are becoming a way of le for some. This is the shame of one of the richest countries in the world. Last year, the number of children living in absolute poverty increased by ,. just so we’re clear, absolute poverty means living below the basic living standard of food, shelter, housing. Millions more live in relative poverty – they can manage, but barely. Last year,  per cent of children living in poverty were in working families. This is what we need to be talking about. With all the squabbling and bitterness iding us over Brexit, these children are being forgotten. The sooner we come together – whichever way Brexit falls – the sooner we can start to help them.

While they hone their skills on the training pitches their wives and girlfriends – like ex-England striker Peter Crouch’s partner Abbey Clancy,  – shop in chic boutiques and dine in smart gastropubs and restaurants. Knutsford is one of the priciest places to live outside London – a swish starter home can cost you £, and a five-bed house £.million.England and Everton star Phil Jagielka, , lives here alongside stars of Manchester United and City. Coronation Street legend Barbara Knox is a local too. And until the last election the MP was millionaire ex-Chancellor George Osborne.   But amid the expensive cars, gated mock Tudor mansions and fabulous Wag lestyles, a dark new menace is emerging. County lines gangs are moving in to sell crack... and bringing heartache and havoc with them. This week I stood in Longridge Park – a playing field within yards of those fabulous cars – and talked to a hooded street dealer who casually told me how drug gangs are re, selling drugs with ease right here where children play and from rented “trap houses”. Luke, just , said: “Scousers are coming to Knutsford to sell drugs. “They drive up in their flashy cars – usually Range Rovers – and sell crack and heroin. “Then you have gangs from Stretford in Manchester who sell weed and pills. They have flats here called trap houses which they rent. “There’s lots of money here which is why they are coming to sell.” Luke’s assessment is confirmed by the charity Crimestoppers, ­who identied Knutsford as one of  areas in the county with a county lines gang problem. Police believe there are  active gangs in Cheshire. They are known to recruit vulnerable children who move in to an area and sell their drugs for them. It’s no surprise to locals. Shopkeeper Parvaz, who works at the Friendly Fayre convenience store, said: “There’s lots of teens travelling from Manchester selling drugs. “This is a nice area and we’re worried it will go downhill.”    Builder Steve O’Rourke said: “They hang around in the park. That’s where the drug deals take place.” A mum-of-two, who did not want to be named, told us teachers from the town’s school Knutsford Academy look out for dealers targeting kids. She said: “The school is fantastic. Teachers come out at hometime to check there’s no one hanging around.” And a pub owner added: “Drugs are re around here. You can spot them a mile away. They come in BMWs.” Police have scored some victories in the fight against drug gangs. In October Marcus Callaghan was jailed for running a £million county lines operation to flood North East England with heroin and cocaine. The -year-old, from Manchester, was arrested at Knutsford Services with drugs worth £, and was later sentenced to  years in prison. A month later Knutsford dealer Callum Scanlan, , was jailed for six years after police discovered drugs with a street value of around £, at a property in nearby High Legh. Civic leaders insist they are doing all they can to help. Andrew Malloy, the medieval town’s Deputy Mayor admits: “We do have an issue with kids from out of town drug dealing. “We’re very close to Manchester so we do tend to get a lot of pupils coming to Knutsford Academy from there as it’s quite a good state school. “The bigger thing is people see Knutsford as affluent so they see money and try to target it.”    Cheshire Police’s Head of Crime Det Chief Supt Aaron Duggan said: “County Lines is an issue we’re investigating in certain areas. “We’re working hard with our partners to deal with the vulnerability and harm caused in this type of offending. “We believe there are currently  active county lines teams dealing drugs in Cheshire – the problem is not unique to us. It impacts on most large towns and cities across the country.” A social media campaign was launched to highlight the dangers of drug operations in Cheshire, where last year it was revealed crime had soared by a huge  per cent. It was the third biggest rise out of all  police forces in England and Wales. Cheshire’s Police and crime commissioner David Keane said: “It’s vital residents in our communities are aware of how these drugs gangs operate to recruit vulnerable people – and the serious implications of becoming involved with these criminals.” Gary Murray, Crimestoppers’ north west regional manager, added: “Gangs from major cities are expanding their drugs networks into Cheshire, and they really don’t care what damage they do. “All they are interested in is making money – once they have done that they will move onto somewhere , leaving a trail of destruction behind them.” Teenger Luke tells me bloodshed has already started. “Someone got stabbed in an alleyway last year,” he says. “I knew him and it could only have been done by an outsider.” Cheshire’s upmarket image has been boosted by its exposure on reality show The Real Housewives of Cheshire.  The show’s original star Lauren Simon, , once said: “I’d put Cheshire on a par with Prince Charles, Camilla and the Queen.” But unless the county lines gangs are found and smashed will wealthy residents like Abbey Clancy and husband Peter Crouch,  – who bought cricketer Andrew Flintoff’s £.million pad in  – move out  “People round here think Knutsford is paradise,” one resident told me. “It’s always been so lovely, so it’s heartbreaking for these horrible gangs to come along and spoil it. “Hopefully by taking action now the police can get a grip of things and make sure we stay just how we are – a lovely little town.”    Criminals net £m every day There are , county lines gangs across the UK, according to the National Crime Agency. And dealers are making over £million a day, with a single phone line capable of generating £, profits in a year. The children are paid between £ and £ a week and aged between  and . At least , youngsters are involved in gang activity in England. The largest number of county lines, about  per cent, originate from the politan Police area, followed by the West Midlands at nine per cent and Merseyside at seven per cent.

Julie Reeves, , her husband, David, took their daughter, Jessica and Julieaposs niece, Ria, on a week-long holiday to the H Lanzarote Princess in Playa Blanca. However, their dream holiday descended into a nightmare as poolside construction work - including drilling and dust - meant the family could not enjoy the hotel during the day. They also claimed that lecherous construction workers stared at the two young girls - making them feel uncomfortable.   The family decided to abandon the benefits of their all-inclusive wristbands and head to a nearby beach - spending hundreds of pounds on sunbeds, parasols food and drink, Mail Online reports.Julie said: We arrived to a construction site around the pool area with pneumatic drills, cement mixers , electric saws and tile cutters. Dust was flying over us continually and lecherous workmen were constantly up and down with wheelbarrows. On that first day we went in early because we had had enough of the noise and the girls didn’t feel comfortable said the workmen were staring which made me feel sick.

They say TUI has failed them twice. A spokesman for TUI said:A TUI spokesman said: We’re sorry to hear of the Reeves party’s experience in Lanzarote.

But another daughter gave key evidence to friend Shahin MunirShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsShafilea went missing September  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Schoolgirl Shafilea Ahmed was brutally killed by her own parents.But without the key evidence from her friend, they may never have been caught. Pal Shahin Munir has now revealed how her bombshell secret helped to convict Shafileaaposs parents. Sixteen-year-old Shafilea was killed in  in a horrendous “honour killing” by her father and mother, who suffocated her by shoving a plastic bag down her throat after years of abuse. Her body was found in a river in Cumbria six months after she went missing from the family home in Warrington, Cheshire. But for nine years her parents, Iftikhar and Farzana Ahmed, believed that had got away with the cowardly murder as police struggled to find evidence to charge them. It was only after one of the sisters, Alesha, broke ranks and agreed to testy in court that she had witnessed her parents kill Shafilea that they were finally charged with her murder.    But prosecutors knew that still might not be enough to convict them - until Shahin Munir came forward with a terrible secret she had kept for the last four years. Shahin produced photocopies of a letter, written by another of the sisters, Mevish, which described seeing the murder with exactly the same details as Alesha’s account. The evidence was now overwhelming and the Ahmeds were found guilty of the murder and jailed for a minimum of  years. Now Shahin has spoken of the moment she first discovered her friend had been murdered, and why she decided to break a vow of secrecy to reveal the secret in a new documentary When Missing Turns to Murder on the Investigation+Crime channel. Shahin Munir became friends with Shafilea and her three siblings after going to the same mosque as them.    After Shafilea was found dead one of them, Mevish, who was now  and studying at the same college as Shahin, began to confide in her about the cruel way her parents used to treat her sister. She said: “For one reason or another she started opening up to me about when Shafilea would be locked outside, that Shafilea would quite often be beaten up, how she wasn’t allowed to do anything. “There were physical beatings, they was a lot of emotional abuse going on, there was a lot of isolation for Shafilea where she’d be locked in her room or even outside. “When Shafilea was in the garden they would try to pass food to her without her mum seeing. “Our friendship was based on the fact that she would open up to me about the things that went on at home, and I was the person she would talk to when things got really bad. She had a genuine fear for her le too.”    When in , four years after Shafilea’s death, Mevish said she wanted to tell her something important, Shahin suggested she write it down in a letter. She said: “At that point I did have an inkling that it would be about Shafilea. I knew this was a big thing for her, I knew it took a lot for her to actually be able to trust me to this extent. “She messaged me saying, ‘Ok, I’ve written it down. “She was going to town that day with her mum, so I got there first and as they walked past she dropped the letters behind her without her mum seeing. “I picked them up and left as quick as i could, in fact i didn’t even look at them until I got home into my bedroom. I say cross-legged and started opening the letters.” Mevish had written in detail about the night her mother murdered Shafilea, while her brother and two sisters looked on.  She said: “They sat Shafilea down on this chair, they had this one chair where they would sit her and the family would gather round, and that’s when they started abusing her and beating her, one would hold her body and one would physically abuse her. “They got a plastic bag and they put it in her mouth and held her down on the sofa, and she struggled until she stopped. And then the kids were told to go upstairs to their room. “Her dad got rid of the body and her mum after came in the bedroom and got into bed with them like everything was normal. “And from that point on the kids understood, you’ll never talk about this again.” Describing her shock, she said: “I always understood the notion of honour within a family, I always understood the notion of shame within a community but I never believed that you could take it so far that you would kill your own.” In the letters the teenager told how Shafilea wet herself as she died, and her mother spent weeks constantly cleaning the sofa to get rid of it. And how they saw her dad put something in the boot of his car and drive off, believing it to be Shafilea’s body. And she wrote how she was constantly plagued by nightmares about the murder. Shahin remembered: “She asked for her letters back, which I knew she would, I think she was too afraid that somebody would find out. I met up with her gave her them back, and without even thinking she ripped them.”  But she had secretly made photocopies of the letters - which she kept for the next four years, telling no-one of their contents. A regular visitor to the Ahmed home before and after Shafilea’s death, Shahin saw the way the parents, who believed their daughter was becoming too “Westernised”, tried to control her. She said: “It was almost an uncomfortable feeling being around the family, because they seemed to be very controlled over everything they said, the conversations they had or what other family members were doing. Eldest daughter Shafilea wanted to wear western clothes like her friends, and have boyfriend she chose for herself. She  repeatedly refused her parents calls for an arranged marriage, which in her their eyes brought shame on the family. Shanin said: “Shafilea did have relationships with boys, you go to school with them, you get to know people. She was texting them but of course all of that had to be hidden. “It couldn’t be on her mobile phone in case her parents would check it, so that aspect of her le was very well hidden.” Six months before her death, Shafilea drank bleach in Pakistan after her parents took her there with the intention of marrying her off. Shanin recalled: “There were talks of a marriage to one of her cousins. She needed an escape, and for her the escape was, ‘I’m going to drink bleach. Because hopefully it’s going to end all of this’. All of her throat was completely burned from the bleach, she was very much skin and bones. Shanin said: “It was only when Shafilea was getting worse and worse that they were forced to buy aticket.  The story was told that actually she drank it by accident, she thought it was mouthwash.” Shafilea was killed on September ,  after her mother Farzana, , collected her from her call centre job and found that she was showing her arms by wearing a T-shirt. After killing her, Shafilea’s father Iftikhar, , is believed to have driven his daughter’s body  miles to Sedgwick, in the Lake District - where he dumped it next to the River Kent. Her remains were found five months later. Shanin said: “When Shafilea’s body was found it changed everything. It was found in a really horrible way and she must have had a really horrible death. It really upset me that someone in the community had died in such a horric manner.”  It was four years later when Mevish, unable to bear the burden of having to keep her sister’s death a secret, opened up to Shahin. Shahin, who had promised never to tell anyone, finally broke her vow of silence four years after that, after being impressed by the courage of Shafilea’s other sister, Alesha, who testied against her parents in court in August . Helen Morris, of the Crown Prosecution Service, described the moment Alesha stood up in court to face the parents who thought they would never be found out. She said: “She was screened from her parents, but the jury could see her. “They were absolutely gripped by what she was saying. She gave an account of how her mother had gone to collect Shafilea from her part time job in a call centre. “Shafilea was apparently wearing a T-shirt, was showing her arms and this had upset her mother.” She said that after getting into a heated argument at home, her mother “suddenly decided she’d had enough and she said words to effect of ‘let’s finish it here’. “She described how Shafilea was held down by he parents on the sofa, a plastic bag was stuffed into her mouth, they put her hands over her hands and nose so she was effectively being suffocated and the children who were all present watched their parents kill their sister.  “She described in great detail how Shafilea kicked her legs and how actually as she was losing control she urinated on the sofa. “Just the detail of how she saw her sister die was so compelling that it was quite clear she was telling the truth about what she had seen. The trial was already underway when police were contacted by Shahin. Ms Morris said: “She thought she had information which would be useful to the police investigating the case. By this time the trial was well underway. “The police met with Shahin and she told them that she had been so impressed by her courage in coming forward to give evidence that she felt she wanted to tell the police what she knew.” The judge then called Mevish as a witness, but she stayed loyal to her parents, claiming the story had been made up and was just an exercise in “creative writing”.

It was the largest amount of money ever won in Britain on the Euromillions lottery.

Adrian and Gillian Bayford  Adrian and Gillian Bayford were over the moon when they scooped a massive £million lottery win in . But less than a year later the couple had split and misery seems to have followed them wherever they go. Last year Gillian was charged with assaulting her ex-boyfriend, Gavin Innes, who she had furiously branded a gold digger. There was insufficient evidence to proceed with the case and the charges were dropped.  She married convicted fraduster Brian Deans, , in August in a lavish ceremony in St Andrews, Fe, six years to the day after she landed her jackpot. Things havenapost been happy for her ex-husband either. Following his orced from Gillian, Adrian has another two failed relationships behind him.

From stuffed animals to tiny pieces of clothing, you can expect to receive a whole range of things.This will be the case for Meghan Markle, , and Prince Harry, , very soon, after their first child is born.However unlike most new parents, they wonapost be able to enjoy and keep all of the things they have been given for the baby - instead they will have to pack many of the gts up andthem.    This is because there are many royal rules they have to follow around gts, including ones given to them to celebrate birthdays, Christmas, weddings and anniversaries. The Royal Familyaposs guidelines state: The fundamental principle governing the acceptance of gts by Members of The Royal Family is that no gts, including hospitality or services, should be accepted which would, or might appear to, place the Member of The Royal Family under any obligation to the donor. In this regard, before accepting any gt, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gt and the nature of the gt itself. Equally, before declining the offer of a gt, careful consideration should be given to any offence that might be caused by such an action. Hereaposs a look at what they can, and canapost, accept.    Gts sent from people they donapost know Royal fans up and down the country will want to send the couple something special to celebrate the birth of their child. But itaposs not really a good idea to do so, as the royal family are expected to refuse thesethere are concerns about the motive behind the gt or person who sent it. That said, there are a few things which the couple can keepthey so desire, but they must fall into one of these categories:  Flowers or food  Books presented by the author, as long as the subject matter isnapost controversial  Other gts which cost less than £.If they receive gts from outside these categories, then it is recommended theythe item to the person who sent it or donate it to another body or organisation.    Gts given by businesses As a general rule, royals are meant to decline gts sent by a commercial enterprise, such as a shop or fashion designer. However, the official guidelines say that they can acceptit is offered as a souvenir during an official visit, or given to mark a royal wedding  special personal occasion - such as a royal birth. If they do decide to accept a gt from a business, Meghan and Harry will have to ensure that the enterprise doesnapost try to exploit the gt to make money.  Gts from public bodies Finally some gts that Meghan and Harry can keep! Well, hopefully. Royals should be allowed to keep gts sent by a public body, including government bodies, trade associations, guilds, civic bodies, the armed services and charities. But there is one catch - they have to be from the UK.Gts sent from overseas Given Meghanaposs US background and the number of countries the couple have toured to date, itaposs likely the couple may be sent presents for the baby from overseas. Royal guidelines state that gts sent from outside the UK should normally be refused, unless the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Commonwealth Secretariat recommends they be accepted.If such gts are accepted, they are considered aposOfficial gtsapos.  Money Seems like a pretty odd thing to send to a wealthy family, but unsurprisingly money is a big no-no for Harry and Meghanaposs royal baby - unless they are accepting it on behalf of a charity. If theyaposre sent money they canapost refuse it orit, they simply must donate it to charity. What can you do instead of sending a gt  Instead of sending a toy or bottle of prosecco to celebrate the new addition to their family, Harry and Meghan have instead encouraged people to donate to charity. In a post on their official Instagram account, a spokesperson for the couple said: The Duke and Duchess  of Sussex are immensely grateful for the outpouring of love and support in anticipation of the birth of their first child. In lieu of sending gts, the couple have long planned to encourage members of the public to make donations to select charities for children and parents in need. If you already made a donation, the couple send you their greatest thanks. Four organisations were selected by the couple, for the public to donate to.

She says people keep mistaking her before and after pictures as a mother and daughter.    But the best thing of all is that she has a new lease of le and is spending more time doing things she enjoys, such as going to the theatre. It sounds stupid but my husband fitted these wardrobes with mirrored doors on in the bedroom, she said, describing the turning point. Before then we had just the one mirror on a single door, so I didnapost really look at myself as much. But when they were fitted it was like I was sort of faced with what I looked like. I would struggle to do things people just take for granted like bending down, or tying my shoelaces - silly things like that.  If we were going to a restaurant I would think aposoh god will I fit round the tableapos it was just a constant worry. Clare who has children aged , ,  and  said before her weight loss she would eat for convenience and would fill up on junk food including cakes and biscuits. The Tesco shop assistant also said she would regularly make up excuses to miss gatherings with family or friends. I never went out, she said. My husband is ex forces and we used to go out to dinners and stuff like that but I would say aposyou go on your ownapos. Orthe kids asked me to go swimming with them I would say aposask your dadapos because I didnapost want to get into a costume. When I think about it now my weight was really holding me back.  Clare said she had tried every single diet there was before deciding to join her local WW group in Crosby. And now, two years on, with healthy eating and exercise she has dropped an amazing six dress sizes to a   and st lb. Everyone has said how much younger I look, she said. People have said my before and after pictures look like a mother and daughteraposs transformation. I was in work and I overheard a customer saying to their friend aposdo you remember her it is Clareapos and the girl was like aposno it isnapost that is someone completely dferentapos. She couldnapost believe it was me and thought it was a new girl that had started. She continued: My husband is dead proud of me, although his bank balance has gone down a bit because I just canapost stop buying clothes.  I am still unsure on what I can wear because it is like dressing a completely dferent body but I love clothes now. I enjoy going out now too and I love going to the theatre at the Royal Court. I would never have done that before because I was nervous I wouldnapost fit in the little seats. And I can do so much more with the kids and they are so proud of me. Clare said she is now looking forward to a holiday to Cyprus in summer with her family, a prospect that would have once scared her. I used to just have a certain set of clothes that I would take on holiday with me but now I am enjoying buying dressy little outfits, she said. It is quite sad when I look at pictures of me before weight loss because I know how much happier and more confident I am now.

She became the first British citizen to be convicted under the Gulf state’s strict cyber crime laws. Laleh was in trouble simply because her ex-husband’s new we ­reported her to police for two emotional ­messages she posted three years ago. There was an international ­outcry over her treatment. And she was ­reunited with her -year-old daughter Paris in a tearful moment in the arrivals hall at Heathrow on Friday Today she lays bare her full agony in her first interview since landing back in Britain.    Laleh, , sobbed as she admitted: “The day before I was told I was free to go I’d given up hope. “I was suicidal. I felt like I was never going to see my daughter again and sent a message to my sister saying ‘I can’t do this any more.’ “I told her, ‘It’s killing me, every day is killing me.’ I felt so much pain and then I turned off my phone. “I could see my whole le flashing before my eyes and I just wanted to die. It was torture to me.” Yesterday her daughter Paris said: “I’m so happy to have Mum back. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her at the airport. “It felt so surreal and for a second I just didn’t believe she was really there. It was an incredibly happy moment. “It was awful being without her. It was asa part of me was missing.    Laleh, a privately educated doctor’s daughter from Richmond, Surrey, was arrested by police at Dubai Airport on March  after she and Paris travelled to the United Arab Emirates city. They flew out so they could grieve at the ­graveside of Laleh’s ­ex-husband Pedro, a banker. He died of a heart attack aged , just seven days earlier. But as Laleh tried to go through passport ­control, she was hauled away for questioning by police. They told her that her ex’s new we, Samah, had made a legal complaint about two Facebook posts she wrote in , including one where she described Samah as a horse.  Laleh says she and Paris cried in fear after being repeatedly shouted at by police officers, who initially held her at the airport for four hours. She said: “Initially I thought it could be a visa problem. It all felt bizarre and I had no idea what was happening. “I kept asking them, ‘What’s going on ’ but they wouldn’t tell me. “The officers were very hostile and I felt really scared. Then a police officer came in and said ‘There’s a complaint against you. Do you know Samah al Hammadi ’ “I just burst into tears. I couldn’t believe that I had been arrested for two Facebook posts made in the UK three years ago.” Laleh and Paris then spent  hours inside Jebel Ali Police Station outside the city. There Laleh was ordered to sign a statement despite it ­being in Arabic and her having no ­understanding of what it said. She later discovered the translation of the Facebook post bore no relation to what she had written.  The statement had the word bitch substituted for horse. The offending posts, which Laleh wrote after seeing a photo of her ­ex-husband getting remarried to his new Tunisian lover Samah, said: “I hope you go under the ground, you idiot. Damn you. “You left me for this horse” and “You married a horse, you idiot.” Laleh said: “I know I shouldn’t have posted the messages but at the time I was distraught. It was an awful time. “Pedro had got remarried so quickly after our orce, which I had never wanted, and I was still hurting.  “I remembered sending the post, but it had happened so long ago and me and Pedro had since made our peace. “I had no idea about the law in Dubai or that you could even be prosecuted for such a thing. I thought ‘This is nonsense.’” Laleh had previously lived in Dubai for eight months with Paris and Pedro after he landed a job as a risk manager with HSBC bank. She ed home with their ­daughter in  expecting him to ­ after he completed his work. But he had begun a relationship with Samah and later filed for orce after  years of marriage. Five months after the orce came through, Laleh discovered he had wed Samah. She admits she then posted the online abuse after becoming ­overwhelmed with shock and anger. Laleh, who was privately educated in Guildford, Surrey, and used to work for London auctioneers Bonhams, was told she was being held in Dubai while she awaited a court hearing. She made the heartbreaking ­decision to send Paris home on her own without her. Laleh said: “Paris was absolutely terried. I thought I can’t subject her to one more minute of this. “I’m still getting shakes now thinking about that moment because I think that was when I realised everything had become real. It was the single hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I said sorry to her so many times.”  In a desperate bid to get her mum released earlier this week, Paris wrote to Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed. On Thursday, Laleh finally ­appeared before a judge. In dramatic scenes Laleh ­collapsed outside the court as she sobbed on the steps and could be heard wailing: “I’m dying”. The judge issued a ­written decision hours later ­ordering that Laleh could be releasedshe paid a £ fine. Laleh said: “I was feeling really dizzy and sick and then I think I must have passed out because the next thing I knew I woke up and there was a ­message from my lawyer telling me a judge had ruled I was free to go. “It felt like I was dreaming and I didn’t believe it was real. I burst into tears of happiness.” But despite being overjoyed to be home, Laleh says she is still struggling to cope with le at home. She has lost her job working at a homeless shelter due to her absence and even faces losing her home. She said: “The moment I saw Paris at the airport was such an overwhelming moment. My heart was aching for her and being able to hold my girl again was so emotional. “I’ll never forget that moment. Being apart from her had been brutal. I’m really happy to be home but I’m still so emotional. I still feel like I’m in a daze and I feel like a fraction of the person I was before.  “This has completely ­broken me physically and mentally. There were so many times I broke down. I was ­constantly terried. “I haven’t felt able to go outside yet since I got back. I feel very vulnerable and very exposed. “It shouldn’t have even been a case, but nobody was ­willing to drop it and I felt like I wasn’t even allowed to have a defence. “I just keep asking myself ‘Why ’ I’m a good person, I didn’t deserve what happened. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.” Incredibly Laleh is now planning on ing to Dubai. She said: “We made the decision to go to Dubai because Pedro died really ­suddenly and it was such a shock. “Paris wanted to go out there and see his grave so that it could feel real and she could get some closure. “I haven’t been banned from the ­country and there is nothing stopping me. It’s clear now the case should never have happened.” Speaking about Samah, Laleh added: “I’m a very forgiving ­person, but I’m hurting too much at the moment to be able to even think about forgiving her. “I feel very sad for her because she can’t be a very happy person.” "},{"url":null,"title":"oldest brit run 100 marathons","story":"NewsOldest Brit to run  marathons wont let dementia stop him doing his stEXCLUSIVE: Malcolm Brookes, , is the oldest Brit to finish  marathons and won’t let dementia stop him from completing his st raceShareCommentsByWarren MangerFeatures Writer:,  APR NewsMalcolm Brookes from Hereford, , is due to run his st marathon in London later this month \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs he prepared to run his th marathon, Malcolm Brookes was looking forward with pride to reaching the ­remarkable milestone.But just months before the race he was given the devastating news that he had dementia .Many in his situation would have thrown in the towel. But not Malcolm. Instead it only spurred him on – and to date he has ­completed an incredible  ­gruelling -milers. In an inspiring interview today he reveals how he will be at the London Marathon later this month. And he tells how he is ­determined to keep going – as long as his mind allows.    Malcolm, , was ­diagnosed with vascular dementia – which affects around , people in the UK – six months before his amazing achievement of becoming the oldest Briton to join the  Marathon Club. His condition means he is finding it increasingly dficult to come up with the right words to share his favourite stories, relying on his supportive we Mary to fill in the gaps.Yet he’s determined that nothing is going to stop him running his st race later this month, when he aims to raise more than £, for Dementia Revolution .The charity supports those living with dementia and funds research into the disease. Father-of-three Malcolm, from Hereford, said: “When I was collecting sponsorship, Mary had to help me. “People I’ve known for years were embarrassed when I couldn’t ­remember their name to put on the form. “That will only get worse. I will get to the stage where the ‘old me’ will disappear down the plughole. “I feel most sorry for my beloved we. She’ll be living with a stranger.”    The first signs that something was wrong came four years ago when, ­normally obsessed with counting ­calories as part of his marathon ­training, Malcolm lost interest in diet. It was so out of character that his GP immediately referred him to a ­specialist, and an MRI scan revealed he had the disease. It seems he may have been at greater risk because of a family history of ­dementia. He believes his father had it but was never diagnosed. It is not only Malcolm’s memory which is deteriorating. His co-ordination has started to suffer too. After running the Liverbird ­marathon in Liverpool last New Year’s Eve, he nearly missed the last train home when he became tangled in the seatbelt of his taxi. His temperament has also started to change, another common symptom of dementia. “I get angry more easily,” he says sadly. “I don’t like that. I don’t want to shout at my lovely we.”    Doctors advised him that to keep living well with the disease he should stay active, eat healthily and socialise. His daily routine – running six miles every other day – helps him cope. He says: “After two miles, a smile spreads across my face. I start to feel better. I feel happy. “I find socialising much harder. It’s not easy when you struggle with words. Sometimes people greet my we but ignore me. They don’t know how to talk to someone who has dementia.” Malcolm, who was born in the Yorkshire mining village of Thurnscoe, did not run his first marathon until he was . It was while he was working as a Methodist minister on Jersey that he spotted an advert for the local ­marathon – and decided to sign up. “The only thing I knew about ­marathon running was that you’ve got to be well-hydrated,” he recalled. “I filled an empty ketchup bottle with water for every mile. I completely overdid it. I was peeing under every bush.” It was  years before Malcolm ran another marathon while visiting family in Portland, Oregon, in the US. Despite “puffing like a steam train” after one mile when he started, his time was only seven minutes slower than his previous race.    He caught the running bug and signed up for seven coastal ­marathons in seven months. But he didn’t realise they were gruelling off-road courses. Malcolm said: “I didn’t know only  people had managed to complete all seven. I had a reputation for getting lost. I missed several miles of one course. I had to retrace my steps then turn around.” During his second London Marathon in  he followed the wrong pace maker for six-and-a-half miles and was dragged along much faster than normal. As a result he is one of the few runners to record his personal best on the crowded streets of the capital –  hours  minutes. At his peak Malcolm ran at least one marathon a month. Unable to find a race in the UK in June , he signed up for the North Sea Beach Marathon in Denmark. He was the only Brit to enter and was filmed for the BBC documentary Coast.

Admitting his claims are aposspeculationapos, he says the navy could have recovered all or some of the plane. And he thinks the government would know exactly or within a few miles of where it had come down. Mr OaposGara believes the plane could have been hijacked over the Indian Ocean when it appeared to head back towards Kuala Lumpur.He told the Daily Star thatit had been shot down on the orders of the Malaysian government when they believed they were preventing a catastrophic terror attack, they could want to cover up their mistake. Speaking to the newspaper, he said: Most likely MH is still lying on the sea bed in that area of the Indian Ocean. Unless the Malaysian government recovered it later. Mr OaposGara said: Of course this is speculation, but itaposs founded on the facts that the three sets of witnesses saw it go down — and despite the biggest search ever in the most likely places — it was never found. Itaposs also supported by the flaperon — the most vulnerable part in a crash landing — and also a few other parts found off East Africa believed to be from MH. He continued: Itaposs a hard stretch, but the navy might have recovered some of the plane or possibly the lot of it. They knew where to find it. Mr OaposGara added: The government would know exactly or within a few miles of where it had come down.    If MH went into a catastrophic break-up or crash for any reason other than a criminal takeover by either a pilot or a passenger hijacker it would have been spotted, he added. It would be radar tracked, red alert calls made and an area of the sea covered in debris that would be located within hours based on the known tracking by radar. So itaposs extremely unlikely the government wouldnapost have known the planeaposs final coordinates and have been in a position to deploy the Navy to recover the plane. Malaysia Airlines flight MH went missing on March , , after taking off from Kuala Lumpur airport bound for Beijing. It lost contact with air traffic control  minutes after take-off over the South China Sea and disappeared from radar. Mr OaposGara said: Within a few days when all of the volunteers who came to search the South China Sea where they were ly told it had vanished over, MHaposs location would have been known.

in the final two years ago with a stoppage-time winner. And there have also been two painful semi-final losses to St Johnstonein  and Motherwell last year .Before McInnes arrived the expectation and anticipation of Aberdeen winning silverware had dwindled – but after becoming the Pittodrie gaffer in March  he has restored the pride.In March  McInnes guided the Dons to the League Cup with a win on penalties against Inverness Caley Thistle for what was the Reds’ first trophy since .Now McInnes is desperate to end the -year wait for a Scottish Cup victory and add another silver lining to his time as Aberdeen manager.He said: “That is the intention – to try to win the cup. I wake up every day thinking about having cup success here. That desire is not any more than it was on day one here because I knew we could put a squad together with our way of working which would be competitive.“That is how it has played out. Myself and my staff work extremely hard to turn out those consistent performances from my team and make players better.“Unfortunately when that happens we lose good players, but we stick to our principles and try to get our reward for that work.“I couldn’t put any more into this job and all my staff work extremely hard.“It’s a job we love doing – and to get that reward for all the hard work and commitment that is put in would be absolutely brilliant.“We have given people a pride in the club again, % we have.“When we came in we said we wanted to make people and the city fall in love with the team again.“We wanted to work in a certain way which allowed us to be competitive.“It wasn’t just a case of ‘we’re Aberdeen Football Club and we have a good history so we’re entitled’.“We had to show that we were smart with our work and we had to work harder than our competitors.“We had to get a team on the pitch which could be competitive and not just because they play for Aberdeen.“We have been the most competitive team in Scotland outwith Celtic.“That is in terms of qualying for Europe every year, reaching semi-finals and finals.“It’s easy for teams to do that over a period of months or a season.“But nobody has got close to us, other than Celtic, for doing it over such a period of time and that is down to everyone at this club.”Not being able to add to a League Cup triumph five years ago does frustrate McInnes, but this could be the year that changes –the Dons can get past Celtic tomorrow.He added: “That is frustrating but we have given ourselves plenty of chances and put ourselves forward.“We’ll try to do that again. Celtic have brilliant players, experienced players, full internationals – but they can be beaten.”McInnes believes the culture within the Dons dressing room is a factor in the consistency of challenging for honours in the last six years.He said: “I needed the right types and players like Willo Flood and Barry Robson were two of those when I came in.“They were part of the culture within the dressing room that is still here now.“We have a culture within the dressing room which was started back then.“We have a way of working – there is an energy, a commitment, a work ethic. From the gym-based work to the standards we demand in training.“When new players come in they know they have something to look up to and something to attain and that’s important.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/SNS-18355071-Stenhousemuir-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"derek wantsa cosgrove masterclass in semi final at hampden","story":"Derek McInnes is delighted with the character and perseverance shown by Sam Cosgrove to become Aberdeen’s main man.And the Dons boss hopes the big striker can fire his side into a Scottish Cup final.The Reds meet Celtic at Hampden in the last four of the tournament with a place in next month’s final at stake.Having hit  goals this season Cosgrove could have a key role to play against the Hoops.At  he is the youngest Aberdeen striker to hit the net  times in a campaign since -year-old Eric Black in the - season.Among Black’s counters was the opener in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final against Real Madrid in Gothenburg and the only goal in the Scottish Cup final against Rangers.Cosgrove won’t get to grace a European final butthe Dons can get past Celtic tomorrow the Red Army will hope he can emulate Black and score in the Scottish Cup final against Hearts or Inverness.After a slow scoring start to the season Cosgrove hit seven goals in five games in December to kick-start his campaign.Gaffer McInnes said: “That is good companyand it’s his first full season with us and his first full season as a professional really.“It says a lot about him and his temperament to do that.“It’s not easy being Aberdeen’s No  and having the expectation to go and get goals.“He’s managed to deal with that and there are more goals in him.“Hopefully he can get a few more important ones for us in the next few games.“I’m delighted for him and what he’s done because he’s shown the perseverance and strength required to be a footballer.”Prior to his purple patch in December Cosgrove had only hit two goals this term.Although the former Carlisle man is not short of self-confidence McInnes admits he started scoring at an important time to boost belief.He added: “I think Sam has always been a confident boy, but goals certainly add to that as a striker.“I can’t give him that and he can’t just become confident like that.“When you score goals you are confident and you feel you can’t miss.“That’s when your enjoy the responsibility of scoring goals and the adulation of scoring goals.“He has, in a short period of time, over the last four or five months accumulated a lot of dferent types of goals and led the line brilliantly.”McInnes kept faith with Cosgrove and he believes a lot was expected of the frontman simply because of his size.At six foot three some expected him to be a battering ram and be completely dominant in the air.But McInnes says that sometimes size is irrelevant and it comes down to good movement, which Cosgrove showed to get his second in last weekend’s - win at Dundee.He said: “Playing him showed faith in him and I can say why he was important to the team and say what his role was for the team during that period.“But there becomes a point where you can only continue that for so longhe’s not scoring.“It was important that he was getting chances to score.“Everybody thinks because he is six foot three he will just be scoring goals in the air.“But you saw his movement last Saturday against Dundee and he was moving short, long and buying that extra yard against defenders.“I always say to him ‘think like a five foot eight striker in the box’.“You don’t just want to be depending on headers because of your size.“Obviously it comes into play when you’re taller against centre-halves and he can peel on to full-backs as well. But sometimes height advantage isn’t one and it’s just about movement.“I think Sam’s movement has been good in giving himself chances to score goals and none more so than last Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"afternoon tea for shelter","story":"A city hotel will host an afternoon tea to raise funds for an animal rescue centre.Dunavon House Hotel in Dyce is to host the event on June  at .pm to benefit Alex’s Farm of Strays, which is based in Tremithousa, Cyprus, but rehomes across Europe.It comes after one of the dogs taken in by the centre, called Basil, was rehomed in Aberdeen.A statement by the hotel said: “This is a great afternoon out which also helps fund the running of the shelter and looking after as many dogs as possible during their time at the shelter.”From the £. ticket price for the event, £ will be donated to Alex’s Farm of Strays to support the centre.To book a place, contact the shelter on aber deenannie@gmailFor more information on the charity, or to help rehome one of the stray dogs that are being looked after, visit alexsfarmof strays"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.34007504-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dolphinwatch returns to aberdeen following last years success","story":"A new season of dolphin watching has begun in Aberdeen.RSPB has launched its year of dolphin viewing at Torry Battery, following last year’s success which saw the team spotting animals every day they were on site.Visitors to Dolphinwatch saw pods of more than  dolphins feeding, breaching and swimming alongside boats in Aberdeen harbour. vw, px\"  This time around, there will be a slightly shorter viewing time than in previous years, with the team on site between am and pm, from Thursday to Sunday until August .There will also be a new silver dolphin badge offered by the team.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"coral scottish grand national festival","story":"NewsCoral Scottish Grand National Festival set to welcome thousands to AyrMore than , race fans will attend the track over the course of the two day festival.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsRace fans are set for a great time at Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe stage is set for Ayr’s busiest weekend of  – the Coral Scottish Grand National Festival, writes Iain Ferguson.

portion of the Tweedbank masterplan is ldquounviable and undeliverable and that ldquoit is quite clear that what is proposed is over-development of the site.The damning report, commissioned by Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound. million in December .Once costs of borrowing and other fees have been factored in, the purchase will cost SBC around pound million and forms parts of its wider plan to address a regional housing shortfall of some  units.The Lowood site has been earmarked for around  properties, however the JLL report suggests that the development is unlikely to yield any financial gain.The report claims: ldquoOur conclusion is that there would be insufficient revenue to generate either a developerrsquos profit or a positive land value.In addition to questioning the economic viability of the

are committed to ensuring the ongoing provision of sport, leisure and fun activities across East Lothian for many years to come.A petition, signed by nearly , people, was launched by a group of concerned parents under the banner lsquoChildren and Families of East Lothianrsquo following the announcement the creches would be closing.A group of parents contacted Iain Gray, MSP for East Lothian, about the issue and met with representatives from enjoyleisure in a bid to see the decision reversed.Mum-of-four Sarah Brunton was among those campaigning for the facilities to remain in place.She regularly uses the sports centres in Haddington, North Berwick and Dunbar and was disappointed to hear a date had now been set.And she warned the decision could lead to people cancelling their memberships.She said: ldquoBasically, the people I have spoken to, each and every one of us, will have to withdraw our membership.\"We have not got any other option.Over the past  years, since enjoyleisurersquos creation, the cregraveche service has been retained for the benefit of customers, despite operating at a shortfall.However, as user numbers continued to decline year upon year, the subsequent financial deficit increased the strain on the rest of the organisation.A spokeswoman for the group said ldquostrict adult to child ratios and current charging requirements reduce enjoyleisurersquos capacity of increasing income for this service, and at existing user levels, it is not possible to retain this provision at an affordable cost to customers.With ldquosubstantial increases in business operational costs and a drop in council funding, enjoyleisure took the decision to ldquore-evaluate its current financial and operational position in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of the whole organisation.Mr Axon told the Courier: ldquoI also recognise the efforts of the lsquoChildren and Families of East Lothianrsquo, with whom I have met with personally, to outline our current position and provide further detail to the wider context within which has ultimately forced us into making these decisions.The general manager also described enjoyleisure staff as ldquoa credit to themselves.He added: ldquoWe would additionally like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and staff for their continued support and loyalty.ldquoAs a local charitable organisation, we cannot survive without your backing, and we are incredibly grateful for this.ldquoAs East Lothianrsquos sports and leisure charity, we work closely with East Lothian Council, local sports clubs and the wider community to maintain affordable access to safe and fit for purpose facilities to the best of our ability.ldquoThis, even though the financial environment within which we operate is currently exceptionally dficult, remains a principal objective.ldquoLikewise, to retain sport and leisure facilities in all our major towns, which allows for easy, local access for all our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"road-to-close-for-film-crew","story":"The A, between Dunbar Road and the roundabout at Aberlady Road, will be shut from am

Three of the four homes would include two bedrooms, with the remaining flat having a third bedroom.A summary for the application describes it as ldquorational that an alternative solution is found to prevent the site from stagnating once the gym closes.Ward councillor Jeremy Findlay, who lives in Gullane, could not comment fully on the proposals because he is a member of the councilrsquos planning committee, which could decide their fate.He said: ldquoI think I can probably go as far as to say I would be disappointedthe village lost yet another facility."},{"url":null,"title":"new-peer-flatmate-scheme-given-cash-boost","story":"The project will put lsquocare-experiencedrsquo young people in flats with students to give peer support and improve options.The young people will share accommodation, giving each of them access to a low-cost home with mutual peer support.The council will be working alongside Hub for Success, which brings together Queen Margaret University, Newbattle Abbey College, Heriot Watt University, Napier University, Edinburgh College, The Open University and the University of Edinburgh.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

Yoursquore going to have to tackle the obesity issue - thatrsquos your problem.\"What really are the granters wishes  Stories of power of attorneyFar from disappearing into her sunset years, she is gaining the kind of social media following many a millennial would envy. Williams, a former physiotherapist, is part of a growing trend ndash the older social media influencer, sometimes called the Instagrans or Insta-grandmas. They include, for instance, -year-old Swede, Dagny Valborg Carlsson, who started blogging after she did a class on computing at the age of , and -year-old Eileen Smith from Ireland, always elegant, with bouffant hair swept back in a bun, in Instagram posts that have have garnered a following of k. Like most of her ilk, Smith espouses a carefree, outward-looking attitude. She has said she keeps a note by her bed that urges, \"Get up, dress up, get out and donrsquot look back.\"Possibly most famous is Baddiewinkle, a -year-old American Instagrammer with grey-haired rebel attitude, whose account sports the tagline ldquostealing your man since . This former factory-worker and farmer, whose real name is Helen Ruth Elam Van Winkle, began her social media career after her great-granddaughter took a photograph of her sunbathing in the garden, whilst wearing cut-off denim shorts, a rainbow tie-dye T-shirt and neon-pink marijuana leaf print socks. She now has . million followers.Williams seems a youngster by comparison. Blogging is something she fell into almost by accident, as a way of making new friends after she had moved, at the age of , to Glasgow where her husband David, whom she had married six years earlier, had a home. ldquoI saw this sign, saying, Blogging for beginners,\" she recalls. \"Irsquom always curious about things and I thought, I donrsquot actually know what a blog is but itrsquos writing and I love writing.When she turned up she found the oldest, apart from her, was a -year-old. Most were in their thirties. When the class leaders told her she should find a topic, she struggled. ldquoThen they said, Well why donrsquot you write about being old  Theyrsquod been so interested in what Irsquod been saying to them. Theyrsquod not really talked to an old person before. That was when I started to think that I really wanted to get across this idea that the image of old age is wrong. Itrsquos not like the media say. Itrsquos not so grim. I wanted to balance the mediarsquos doom and gloom. I thought, I will post the positives that the media doesnrsquot publish.Several years on, Williams is still all about the positives. Not only does she believe that she is happier now than almost any other stage in her le, but she believes the course of history has made things better for most people. ldquoI do think the world has got better. The quote I love is that Louis XIV, the Sun King, had  chefs, he could have a choice of  dishes at his meals. We can go into Tesco and get . We are richer than the Sun King ndash the average person.She tells tales from her own youth, growing up in industrial South Yorkshire, which put our current woes in perspective. Her grandmother was so poor that when she got ill in old-age she was cared for in the local workhouse ndash but Williams now, she observes, like many her age, has a nice pension. Le expectancy has enormously extended. She says shersquod like to get together with a few young women now to talk about how bad it was back then.ldquoAttitudes around abortion and homosexuality and contraception were so dreadful. There was this whole disapproval of bastardy in my childhood. My best friend got pregnant at university. She had to go into a home to have the baby. It was given away for adoption. Never saw it again. She would have made a wonderful mother. It wasnrsquot okay to be a single parent then. It was a scandal.#MeToo, meanwhile, is something she doesnt \"understand\". \"What is it ,\" she says. \"Itrsquos all this I was abused as a kid. But we all were. It was normal. We learned to laugh. There was a flasher who turned up at our school gate most lunchtimes and we all had a wander down to have a giggle. You just learned to laugh. We didnrsquot take it seriously. We werenrsquot harmed by it.\"What she wanted to be, she decided, when she wrote a business plan for her blog, was a ldquonational ageing influencer - a go-to person about ageing. ldquoIrsquove done that, she says. ldquoThere are other influencers out there, Charlotte Rampling, Joan Bakewell, Helen Mirren, but theyrsquore famous for dferent reasons. They havenrsquot got there from being just an old person, with no other reason to be famous.Many of the older people causing a sensation on Instagram are those that seem to bust stereotypes in some sort of outrageous way, by wearing flamboyant outfits, saying shocking things or by doing some extraordinary feat. Lili Hayes, in the United States ndash Instagram bio \"always a little pissed ndash has won over k followers for her posts in which she is seen dressed in streetwear, sporting a signature Supreme cap, while making faces or working out to Nicki Minajrsquos Anaconda.Or there are the wild risk-takers, like Dilys Price, who set the world record for the oldest female parachute jump, a long-term blogger on her own website, who only just joined Instagram, declaring ldquoI am one of the few octogenarians now on Instagram at  years young!But Williams isnrsquot about such extremes. She doesnrsquot think you needed to be ing out of an aeroplane or running an ultrathon to prove that your late years can be lived well. ldquoYou donrsquot need to go skying, she says. ldquoYou can doyou wish. But all you need to do is get yourself out the house and go for a walk, with a dog, or look at the flowers. Le is great. There is no need to be excessively fit. Therersquos a lot of research now on the need to do some weight-training. She shuffles in her chair and begins doing some push ups. ldquoI do it in this arm chair. Donrsquot need to go to a gym.Why does she think her blog has worked  ldquoIrsquove worked very hard at it. Its only been two and a half years and Irsquove written way over a hundred blogs. Irsquove tweeted every morning for all of that time. Irsquove done a lot of research into ageing and every time Irsquove found an interesting blog about ageing and ageism, Irsquove tweeted it with comments. Irsquove explored the internet and found anybody who is an influencer in ageing and Irsquove always sent them my blogs.Of those hundred plus blogs, three of her posts have got her more publicity than anything  ndash landing her, for instance, on television, being interviewed by Philip Schofield on This Morning. These three, though a fraction of her output, have had her labelled, across the media, as a sex blogger or sexpert ndash and itrsquos to this that she objects. Yes, they were about sex but that doesnt make her a sex blogger. The way she has been labelled is, she says, is a kind of voyeuristic ageism in itself.ldquoA respectable professional woman with an MBE, chair of a national society, being labelled Grandma Williams sex blogger  They wouldnrsquot have done thatit were you, a woman in your forties. No one would pick it up and make a headline and invite you to speak on television with Philip Schofield.The first of these posts was written because of the conversations she was having with other people on her workshop. Some, she recalls, were writing dating advice blogs. ldquoOne of them in particular, was pretty frank, about how to do a good blow job, and they were talking about this and they were looking at me, thinking is it all right to talk about this in front of her. I thought, hang on a minute! Irsquove had  years more experience than you of sex. I do know what a blow job is. I realised that it was something that needed to be said, because that was again part of the image of old age, that we just stop having sex when wersquore over .Williams also sees plenty of people in her age group enjoying late-le romances ndash including some friends of hers who she says are like ldquoblooming lovebirds ndash canrsquot put each other down. In her seventies, she had her own such romance. Her husband David was someone she had known for decades, through his we, who also was a physiotherapist. ldquoI came to this house when they first got married,  years ago. And then my husband died and eventually she died, so we got together.\"Irsquove got Scotland rooting for me, which is really special ndash Glasgow makeup vlogging sensation Jamie GenevieveUnlike Grandma Williams many of the most popular influencers are style icons in some way and find their biggest impact on Instagram, where they, like younger influencers, also attract big brands who want to work with them. For instance, one of the most followed older Instagrammers in England is Suzi Grant, a nutritionist, former television presenter and author of books, including Alternative Ageing. When, in her sixties, she found herself bored, her two god-daughters both, separately, suggested she start blogging.Her Alternative Ageing blog is a fusion of style-advice, health tips and general wisdom about living well. She has around , followers on Instagram, half of which are under the age of . Like Williams she beams positivity.ldquoIrsquom a very cup half full person, she says. Though shersquos all about the style ndash a vintage look incorporating s hair bangs and endless headscarves ndash she also comes across as care-free and not too bothered about her wrinkles or saggy bits. ldquoWersquove all got body dysmorphia, havenrsquot we  But, Irsquove got over it.For her, the blog, is absolutely ldquonot about fashion. Itrsquos about style. ldquoI donrsquot do just fashion and I think thatrsquos why itrsquos been successful. My blog is about how you feel. Irsquove always said right from the beginning that I want women to look good but feel great. I think feeling great is far more important than the looking good. If yoursquore really healthy and you exercise and lead a really full happy le, then just dressing up a bit more can make the dference between walking out the door feeling invisible and walking out the door feeling really happy.\"One of the things, she says, that worries her is how few posts there are on UK Instagram with the hashtag #over or #styleover, by comparison with the equivalents in younger decades. ldquoItrsquos really bad. Irsquove got a huge job to do. Itrsquos not a problem in America, there are masses of influencers over , even over . In fact, itrsquos very popular there and there are loads of bloggers in those categories as well as older people who have become famous because of the way they dress.Grant is referring to what is sometimes called Advanced Style, a movement celebrating style in older women that was partly triggered by the blogs of Ari Seth Cohen, and the book and documentary that followed. She cites Seth Cohen as her inspiration. ldquoWatching the Advanced Style documentary started the whole thing for me. I now know him. Hersquos a personal friend of mine. But he thinks I look too young still for his blogs, which is really distressing. He took a picture and looked at the camera and said, lsquoYoursquore still too young.rsquo He wants them with really grey hair. And also I donrsquot think Irsquom outrageous enough.Grant says that this is one of the happiest periods of her le. ldquoIrsquom doing everything that Irsquove always loved doing in a career without any of the stress.This emphasis on happiness is something she shares with Joyce Williams, who says she believes that for many the years over  are the happiest in their lives. This, she says, is backed up by statistics, by what she calls the graph of happiness which peaks at around  years old ldquoand stays high.\"I was quite suicidal at  years old, she says. ldquoSeriously suicidal. That was because I lost my husband at that point to cancer and wersquod only been married two years. I wasnrsquot a really confident teenager or young woman either. But Irsquove always had a curious mind.\"I think it surprised me how happy you are over . I didnrsquot realise what a good le it is until I got there and all my friends all said the same thing. People say, Are you worried about dying  No, Irsquom happy to die. Irsquove done everything I was going to do. I live day to day somehow. Itrsquos more serene. Itrsquos a bit like meditation in some ways, you get more serene, more adjusted to le."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  As May goes down for the third time  the road to Brexit just got a whole lot longer","story":"The Prime Minister has behaved asshe had a thumping Commons majority when in fact she is a minority leader of an unstable coalition. Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

Living in Pitlochry, she was also concerned about the distance to the hospital in Perth, so she started researching alternatives.She said: ldquoThe evidence I was looking at suggested it was safer for me to have a home birth as my risk factors were really low.:Only two in  mothers in Scotland having a home birth - but NHS Tayside records -fold increaseAfter a seamless birth with Lauchlan at home, it was an easy decision to do it again two years later with daughter, Vaila, who was delivered in just  minutes.Mrs Gray said:Lauchlan had never been away from me before. It meant he didnrsquot need to be separated from us and then brought back in to a little interloper in the house. And for the older boys as well, just the continuity of taking away that disruption.That her husband could stay after the birth and keep himself busy during labour when he was not needed was another bonus. She said: ldquoHe was able to support me with our baby without having to leave at the end of visiting time.ldquoThere was no feeling of being rushed, it was all very relaxed and calm.

Itrsquos always scary birth stories that are shared and that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy becauseyou do go into hospital in such a state of fear often you have a longer labour because you are actually slowing it down with this ongoing fight or flight response.A home birth is not suitable for everyone, whether through choice or circumstance but it doesnrsquot have to be stressful, Ms Nealon said. She recommends labouring for as long as possible at home so the hormones that promote calmness can have a chance to kick in. She said: ldquoBirth is so natural and instinctive .

It has a beautul crust and the textures are just incredible. It just gives you peace of mind that they deliver quality at all times. Matt,\" he adds, \"is just so inspirational. Hes a lovely man, just awesome. Hes got a nice way about him ... unlike, he says with a quick laugh, ldquous chefs.\"The artisan bread comes from an operation located in Unit E of Rosemount Business Park. Freedom Bakery, its called. . And the Matt  That would be Matt Fortune, a -year-old social entrepreneur.Four years ago Fortune established the bakery at HMP Low Moss, in Bishopbriggs. It was a bold step in all sorts of ways. At first it was a small operation, training prisoners in the exacting art of making artisan bread, and selling the produce to city restaurants and cafes. In , having decided to expand properly, Fortune opened purpose-built premises in the business park. The move was realised via funding from the social-investment charity, Resilient Scotland, and from nearly pound, crowdfunding, which was raised in just  days.Today, the bakery has a staff of , a quarter of whom are former prisoners, and who work under the direction of professional bakers. Its wholesale menu ranges from wholemeal or ryeberry sourdough to croissants, pain au chocolate, brioche buns and baguettes. Fresh bread is supplied not just to Tamburrinis kitchens in Edinburgh but also to Gamba, the Ubiquitous Chip, The Ox  Finch, and Crabshaak in Glasgow. They are among  businesses that have accounts with Freedom.In addition to the ex-prisoners on the staff, the bakery offers day-release training programmes to prisoners from Greenock, Barlinnie and Low Moss. And, where it can, it seeks to offer jobs to its trainees once their sentences come to an end.For this is the point of Freedom Bakery: its a social enterprise that believes that people who are at risk of committing crime can benefit signicantly from professional training and job opportunities. It bridges the gap between being in custody and suddenly regaining freedom, and maintains a continuity for such people at a time \"when nearly everything  about their lives,\" it says, \"is chaotic.\"Fountain points out that . per cent of prisoners in Scotland commit another crime within a year of being released, but that a prisoner who finds work is  per cent less likely toto prison. A recent report by a Commons Select Committee at Westminster said that re-offending in England and Wales costs an estimated pound billion a year. Put these figures together and you can see the advantages of small but thriving ventures like this bakery.The business is open to every category of prisoner, except those who have committed sex crimes, or crimes involving children. It mostly works with inmates serving sentences of four years or more. Some have done time for fraud, others for drug-related offences. Some have spent most of their le behind bars. Some have physical disabilities, or mental health issues, or are recovering from addictions.The bakery has also paid for therapy for some employees and in a number of cases has helped place a deposit down for a home to rent.Prisoners can get placements here while they are serving their sentence. \"For some prisoners, when they are in the last year of their sentence, as part of the rehabilitation process theyre given the opportunity to go out of the prison on day release,\" says Fortune, . \"For the prison, its primarily about risk, and seeing that the person be trustworthy and not run away.\"Actually, its a great opportunity to meet someone while theyre still in prison, part of - for want of a better word - a captive market and try and bring them round to the sort of hard-line outcomes that makes someone employable and able to do a job, but, more than that, getting them used to the stresses and strains of a fully ing bakery and being part of the team.\"All of that goes with a job that you and I experience every day but for some of these people, who have literally never had a job, its a bit more dficult. But its also more rewarding.\"A lot of research - policy and criminological - shows thatyou can form a relationship with someone while theyre still in prison, and maintain that relationship once they leave, the likelihood of them reoffending is greatly diminished, and the likelihood of them changing their le for the better is all the more assured.\"So the relationship changes,\" he continues, \"and they become employees of ours, on the same pay-scale as everyone  in the bakery. Eventually, people move on, but its not something we push necessarily. You could see that there might be a problem in a couple of years when we have too many employees and not enough work or capacity, so were trying to develop a way of starting up people in very low capital-intensive businesses, jobs, which we fund and in which that person is able to make his own cash.\"Fortune stresses that these plans have still to be finalised, and says its only because the bakery has been \"quite successful that we feel confident that we can slowly but surely expand that business to be able to do this.\"Back in December , when the Low Moss bakery was but a few months old, Fortune told a reporter from this paper that he had recruited his team of prisoners by placing adverts in the halls where they lived, then issuing application forms. One inmate had already developed a walnut and rye bread, which was proving remarkably popular. .Fortune acknowledges that the Scottish Prison Service was more than happy to work with him at Low Moss. \"The honest truth is that this came about because the SPS wanted it to happen. Unfortunately, Ive no powers of lobbying or of understanding the politics, which are very bureaucratic and fraught. So this really did come from them. It was always an experiment for them, and I guess it was an experiment for me, because I had never done anything with food before, never done anything with criminal justice.\"Its a miracle that it ever survived, and flourished. But here we are. Were still going, still learning many lessons, but with a little bit more breathing space than we used to have.\"Were there any models that he looked to when he was setting up at Low Moss  \"Not really. I did look at a bakery in Italy [San Patrignano, which works with recovering drug addicts], but that was more for inspiration:they could get recovering drug addicts to do amazing things, why couldnt this happen where  I looked at the Clink charity, which runs restaurants inside prisons in England and Wales. Its really impressive, and I guess that had a great deal of influence on me when I was starting out. But as with so many things, you dont know what youre really doing until youre actually doing it.\"Wrongly or rightly, one of the things that I was quite passionate about was to not be publicly funded. One reason was reputational: its a very common agenda in criminal justice that the public doesnt want justice to cost more. The other was because theres a degree of freedom in being able to operate the way you need to, rather than conform to the really quite regimented funnels of how money is measured in terms of outcome.\"Fountain is happy with the success the business has achieved but is far from complacent. \"I think its down at the end of the day to what we make,\" he says. \"Artisan bread seems to be getting more popular. Theres always a place for bread like this in high-end restaurants like Pauls.\"However, over the last year I would say that weve been getting wholesale requests from customers that perhaps you wouldnt expect would want this product: you wouldnt expect them to be paying the premium for it. So I guess the market is growing, where everything  in bread is dramatically falling.\"With some bemusement he notes that a well-known Scottish bakery recently sold off its equipment. Its traditional bakery market had collapsed to the point where it made more sense to retool the premises so that it could make dog biscuits instead. \"There is more money and more sustainability in making dog biscuits than there is in making bread,\" he observes.Some  prisoners or former prisoners have worked with the bakery. Ten of them have gone into employment, two of them have reoffended.\"To this day,\" says Fortune, \"my experience of them is that every one is pretty dferent. Some of their problems are similar but everyone reacts in a dferent way and their experience of prison has been dferent as well.\"Of the four former current prisoners working at Freedom, theirof service ranges from one month to two-and-a-half years, \"on and off. We have one guy whom we trained while he was in prison and was given a job as soon as he came out. He took a full-time job where and I asked him to come back - headhunted is too grandiose - because hes really good at his job. And come back he did.\"He modestly downplays the role played by the bakery when it comes to those prisoners who, through it, have found employment and started to rebuild their lives.\"At the end of the day, one of the things that I feel really passionate about is that people get places because they work at it. In our factory you have a great situation on the table that someone can take advantage of. Some people have thanked me but equally they would be thanking some of the other team-mates.\"Some of the best connections that people here make are with someone who has been through the prison system and is now working at the bakery, slightly further down the line. But what I would say about our team is that its incredibly strong, and very close-knit, but,\" he adds with a laugh, \"are entirely a pack of strays as well.\"Fortune is equally modest on the subject of his own circumstances. \"I basically havent done anything with my le. I was an eternal student and was offered a funded PhD at Oxford. I had quite severe cold feet about going onto that, so I stopped it and started to think about what someone like me could do.\"As it happens, I couldnt really get a job. Like quite a lot of people you look to charity work because you can see it as being fulfilling, and for my sins thats what I did. I realised after a little while that I wanted to do my own thing, I wanted to do some social enterprise, I wanted it to be in food, because Ive always been very interested in food. I think its a very social thing when youre making it for other people. The bare bones came from these impulses and instincts, and slowly it became a bakery idea.\"Though my experience of this world is quite short, I think there is genuinely more and more of an interest that businesses have some positive impact beyond their shareholders and their profit margins. And one of the things that I try to do ... is that we dont really market anything about our products as having anything to do with our social impact agendas, so much so that Ill go to a tasting with a potential customer and theyll have no idea that were a social enterprise.\"Rightly or wrongly, I quite like that, because it gives me the sense that people want our bread because they like it, and not because of the story. Therersquos dignity in it and dignity is what our people need to get their lives back on track.\"At the end of the day, well go nowherewe cant sell our bread. The idea is that we are masters of our own destiny, and in this sort of recession-post-recession and who knows whats happening with Brexit, thats really important.\"The head baker at Freedom, Scott MacKenzie, , has been with the operation since its earliest days in Low Moss. He started a matter of weeks after Fortune got permission to build a bakery there. \"I did all the recipes and the menu and the training for all the guys.\"When we got the opportunity to set up the bakery the way I wanted it done, I designed it around a process that would be as simple as possible, to try and maintain consistency. That is the biggest goal for me.\"In his time he has worked alongside numerous former or current prisoners. \"There are two sides to this,\" he says. \"Not everyone wants to be a baker, long term, in their le. But when theyre in jail its a very surreal environment what the bakery does is create a normal working environment, where they all get treated equally. Eventhey dont go into baking, it helps them with team-work and communication. Ive seen some guys who have benefited from that, eventheyve not come on board after theyve got out of jail.\"Paul Tamburrini for one is full of praise for what is happening at the bakery. \"What he is giving to those guys is just incredible,\" he says. \"I cant speak highly enough of him as a person.\"The chef was impressed by what he saw when he posed for photographs at Freedom the other week. \"Im hoping to take my kitchen staff back up there to see what they do,\" he adds. \"Our head chef is going to spend three or four days there - not to pinch ideas or anything like that, but just to see all the aspects of it what theyre doing to help these young guys, how they make the bread ...

politicians have highlighted the need for the A dualling process to take into account the impact of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.Current infrastructure plans for dualling the A past Inverurie to Huntly are in place, and a selection of route options are being analysed.During During Portfolio Questions at Holyrood on Thursday, April , Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin requested information on how the impact of the AWPR and the projected impact of dualling the railway line between Inverurie and Dyce, as well as the building of a new station at Kintore, is being analysed and taken into account as part of this process.Commenting, Gillian Martin MSP said: “The feedback on the AWPR to date has been extremely promising and I’m glad to hear that its impact, as well as that of other infrastructure projects in the area, will be taken into account as part of the design for the A dualling programme.“The dualling of the A is one of the next phases in transforming our infrastructure and it’s great to see increasing SNP investment in the North-East.“This is a long-awaited project which promises huge potential for the region and I look forward to its continuing development.”Meanwhile north east MSP Lewis Macdonald called on ministers to reconsider the shortlisted route options for dualling the A at Inverurie, to take into account up-to-date traffic data.Following a period of settling down of traffic behaviour, a traffic data collection exercise will be undertaken by Transport Scotland and a comparison made between the forecast and actual performance of the project.The Online Inverurie or OLI option for dualling the existing A on the edge of the town was ruled out by Transport Scotland last year.Lewis Macdonald, speaking after quizzing Transport Secretary Michael Matheson at Holyrood, said: “Taking the Online Inverurie option off the table at this early stage is not only premature, but it is based on data which is seriously out of date.“I met Michael Matheson last month, to argue that Online Inverurie should be on the shortlist of possible ways of upgrading the A. I told him how strongly many local people felt about this, because of the impact of building a whole new road north and east of the town.“He revealed that Transport Scotland has no intention of looking again at the A options, despite the fact that they have made their case on the basis of completely out-of-date information.“Road users from Inverurie and further west know full well that the AWPR has had a major impact on the A at Inverurie, which only strengthens the case for upgrading that specic stretch of existing road.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Connie Sorrie with the award and the Greengrocer family team\"  National award for family firm viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Ministers must listen to local people on this issue, and base any decisions on up-to-date traffic data.

The Fingal is a floating hotel permanently berthed on Leith#s vibrant waterfront and a brilliant addition to the capital#s leisure offering. Built in Glasgow in , the sister vessel to the Royal Yacht Britannia spent years as a tender ship taking supplies and kit to Scotland#s most remote, storm-lashed lighthouses. A couple of years ago it saw a new lease of le as a First World War-style dazzle ship, but its artistic stint over, it’s been reborn after a £ million makeover, courtesy of the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust. Following a top to bottom revamp it’s been reimagined as a boutique hotel. The ft ship boasts a grand double-height ballroom, sophisticated drinks and dining area,  cabins and five-star facilities throughout. It’s already gained the Windsor seal of approval, with the Princess Royal, in her role as Patron to the Northern Lighthouse Board, having stayed over. The first thing you notice after wandering up the gentle Alexandra Dock gangplank is the Art Deco reception area, with a set of world clocks behind the desk and a rather incredible circular glass elevator based on a lighthouse lantern room, one of two on the ship and only around six worldwide. You could imagine Fred and Ginger dancing on its decorative floor as they ascended to their suite – or they might saunter up the stairs, holding onto the thematically perfect maritime rope that serves as a banister. Not that any steadying is needed, there’s no rocking on the Fingal – the ship isn’t going anywhere. Each cabin is named after a Stevenson lighthouse. Depending on preference – and budget – the accommodation ranges from the generously proportioned classic suite to the massive presidential Skerryvore penthouse via duplex options. We were in the classic North Ronaldsay cabin, and while it doesn’t come with the top-of-the-range private deck, it does open onto a section of deck from where Leith’s waterfront looks totally magical. If you prefer to stay indoors, cute portholes offer a window on the world. The cabin itself is designed to recall the Fingal’s proud history, without succumbing to an OTT thematic tweeness. The skipper-style swivel chair, king-size bed with headboard showing the position of ‘your’ lighthouse on the seascape, Davy lamps and heavy brass taps, diamond details nodding towards lighthouse , elegantly tiled bathroom with handheld and rain showers... Mod cons include smart TV, WiFi, underfloor heating and more. Even the bed throw and cushions are something , with a specially commissioned Fingal weave courtesy of local artist Araminta Campbell. The Fingal logo, incorporating the ship, waves and Neptune’s trident, pops up around the hotel, from the leather chair backs to the menus. Public areas include the original bridge, where the desk is loaded with original log books whose entries make for fascinating reading. Would-be Captain Haddocks can even get their hands on the wheel – just don’t expect to get the old girl moving towards the nearby Ocean Terminal shopping centre. A couple of decks down, expect to be stunned by the sumptuous ballroom, which has room for  guests to dine, two curving, sweeping staircases, a removable skylight and a raised gallery for music and entertainment. If the ridiculously romantic Fingal doesn’t become one of the most popular places in Scotland for weddings I’ll eat my... well, anything from the Lighthouse Bar menu, please. The Lighthouse Bar, behind the bridge, is a classy, classic space for drinking and dining. The booth iders feature lighthouse-style ‘lenses’, the roof is shimmering dappled brass and the floor-to-ceiling windows offer stunning views as the light changes. While the supper menu isn’t vast, it’s ied and the dishes we chose – including a starter of salmon that’s been smoked on board, a broccoli and mushroom cannelloni main and apple tarte tatin afters – were glorious. Several of the crew members are shared with the Britannia and the service really is fit for a queen – always friendly, never brash.In a hotel where the wow factor \u2028is everywhere, the engine room \u2028really is something , with glass-led floors providing a peek at the original ship’s workings, and reflective walls conjuring an infinity effect – stretch your arms across the tight corridor and become a human paper doll.This unique floating hotel is perfectly placed for a short break in the capital, with great transport links to the world-class city centre attractions – but don’t be surprisedyou find yourself deciding to stay on board the five-star Fingal... it’s lighthouse fantastic. ■The Fingal, Alexandra Dock, Leith, Edinburgh EH DX.

Hit the Brexit snooze button. Lived to fight another day. But let’s get real. The new deadline of Halloweendoes not solve very much. The extra time is no panacea. If anything, it’s allowed everyone a foolish and dangerous sigh of relief. It’s back to business as usual.We heard the same tired old soundbites from both sides in the House of Commons chamber and MPs have been rewarded by being gted back their Easter recess. If you want to avoid Brexit, avoid the Canary Islands for the next few weeks. This extra time off is problematic. It’s not long enough to do anything radical and is only going to make everyone double down on their entrenched positions. May is still trying to push the deal which no one wants. Cross-party talks are now a charade. She won’t move her red lines and why would Corbyn rescue her now, when the Tory party is at breaking point and the polls have finally offered him some comfort : Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon leads calls for People’s Vote during extensionThe Tory MPs of the ERG are thinking strategically for the first time in history and will focus on making May history as soon as possible so their mancan get cracking. Supporters of a People’s Vote are happy as they think a delay increases its chances. And the European elections have raised a weird cheer at both ends of the Brexit spectrum – although they could get nasty. Hard Brexiteers hope that a Farage pro-Brexit surge will scare the bejesus out of the Tory party and pave the way for their hardline Eurosceptic God. And the ‘revoke article ’ brigade want to use the elections to make the big, bold, unashamed positive case for the European Union, which they feel wasn’t made during the  EU referendum.They are excited. I know people who swore they were done with politics who are now busy applying to be MEP candidates.It will also, of course, give The Independent Group or Centre UKas well as the smaller pro-Europe parties a big opportunity to seethey can make an electoral splash.: Brexit: David Mundell says Tories could back customs union in talks with LabourThe particular choreography of the latest delay also provides the SNP with an opportunity which is already proving irresistible.Sturgeon has been careful not to use Brexit to pivot into Indyref but it is fascinating that she is now making the argument that countries with populations similar to or less than Scotland’s were lording it over the UK. “If we become independent, we get to sit at that table enjoying the same solidarity shown to Ireland – instead of being sidelined by Westminster.” This is double edged. She knows her SNP supporters will love it, but is smart enough to clock that many folk will translate the chaos of Brexit into Scotland breaking away and feel terror. She has said she will reflect over the Easter recess and make a statement, but she should be careful. She has won plaudits for her leadership on Brexit but that could changeit looks like she’s weaponising it for her own project.For now, this second extension is an Easter gt to all sides. Everyone can carry on having their cake and eating it. Nothing has changed.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit nine takeaways from another delay paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Who#s got most to fear from a Halloween Brexit delay  Paris Gourtsoyannis casts his eye over the fallout from Brussels.EU unity has started to fractureThere was real anger, particularly in Germany, at Emmanuel Macron’s stand against a long Brexit delay – but more countries could join him in Octoberwe end up back in Brussels without any progress.This isn’t the last delayOther EU leaders were keen to send the signal that the end date isn’t important – avoiding no-deal is.

Instead, the party’s focus will turn to getting a general election, so dragging talks out is more important than a breakthrough.: Brexit: Second referendum in sightSNP stop pushing independence – Ian Murray MP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm rees mogg s hissy fit as lies come home to roost","story":"Euan McColm writes that the normally insouciant Eurosceptic in chief has let slip that his back#s against the wall.It was as revealing as it was, seemingly, out of character. Conservative Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg does a dependable line in being quaintly courteous during his frequent interventions on the vexing issue of Brexit, so when he lost his temper last week and threw a tantrum over the prospect of further delays to the UK’s departure from the EU, he revealed a side of him we don’t usually see.It was not a pleasant spectacle.If a Brexit delay meant the UK being – thanks to the need for us to participate in May’s European elections – “stuck” in the EU, then it would be incumbent on our representatives in Strasbourg to be “as dficult as possible”. Rees-Mogg suggested such wheezes as a veto on any increase in EU budgets, the obstruction of any moves towards the creation of an EU army and a block on what he described as French president Emmanuel Macron’s “integrationist schemes”. As is the norm with a frustrated hard-Brexiteer, Rees-Mogg lashes out at others when things don’t go his way. The frightfully polite gentleman schtick evaporates and the teeth are bared beneath that stf upper lip.Pro-Brexit politicians and campaigners would, it seems, never dream of asking themselves whether they might bear any personal responsibility for the situation in which the nation now finds itself.They campaigned in the  referendum on the promisesthat the NHS would prosper and the rest of the world would beat down the UK’s door to lavish us with trade deals.They told us that departure from the EU would be straightforward and painless, predicting negotiations carried through on a warm pillow of bonhomie. And they told us the country would unite behind its new “independent status”.Cynically deflecting every legitimate question as part of a Project Fear strategy, Brexiteers double down on their claims. The problem with anyone who dared to suggest that Brexit mightn’t usher in a new era of British prosperity was that they just didn’t believe.Meaningless stuff, of course. A crisis is a crisis no matter what one believes.Rees-Mogg’s fellow travellers on the Hard Brexit right now say that democracy has been betrayed by the failure of the UK to have left the EU on schedule. The current delay – which looks likely to be extended – and the prospect of the UK having then to participate in May’s European elections has pushed some already furiously angry people closer to the edge. Phasers have been set to maximum outrage.“Forgive them father for they know not what they do,” said Mark Francois, the puffed-up little red-faced Tory MP who’s begun appearing on TV every day in order, it would appear, to display the many and ied ways in which he is a buffoon. We were dangerously close to “Jesus would have voted Leave” territory here. But that’s the hysterical crank-right for you.Rees-Mogg, Francois, the whole whining lot of them, are not the victims of others out to get them. They have not fallen foul of a sinister EU plot or been thwarted by a conspiracy against democracy. The truth is that they and all of the other snake oil salesmen who punted a painless Brexit have been caught out by their own lies. It is as simple as that.During the  campaign, these politicians – and other scoundrels like Boris Johnson – steered away from facts and depended on the emotional response of voters. It was all Take Back Control! and promises of endless sunlit uplands.Nobody who campaigned to Remain is responsible for the fact Leavers relied on unicorn-land fantasies of prosperity to make their case.Brexiteers sneered at the suggestion the EU might not give the UK everything it demanded during departure negotiations. We held so many cards, they said, that our European neighbours would do whatever it took to secure a deal.Now that we know for a fact that the EU has negotiated with the best interests of the EU in mind – fancy that –Brexiteers complain that the UK should have been more forceful.In the fevered fantasies of your Mark Francoises, a Brexiteering hard-man should have walked into those negotiations, slammed his fist on the table and told the whole damned lot of ’em how things were going to be.Rees-Mogg and his cronies in the European Research Group tell us a story of a United Kingdom forced to bend the knee by Europe. In their fantasy, a once-proud Britain is dictated to by the EU. Stripped of influence and power, Britannia has been brought to her knees by unrelated mandarins with their spiteful diktats.Yet, the Rees-Mogg strop suggests to me he knows full well the tale of British subjugation is nonsense. If the UK could go ahead and cause the chaos he wishes to see, doesn’t that rather suggest we have a great deal more influence in the European Union than Brexiteers would like us to think As they get angrier, Brexiteers’ language becomes more dangerous. We’ve heard the accusations of betrayal and treachery, we’ve seen the way some MPs have been singled out for protests by mobs who buy into the lie that the chaos of Brexit represents nothing less than contempt for democracy.This is ugly stuff and I fear things may get much worse.If they do, then those who promised a Brexit that appears – as the nation was frequently warned – to be undeliverable will, I am sure, wring their hands and complain about elites and their contempt for voters. But they cannot continue to outrun their culpability for where we now find ourselves – a bitterly ided Britain that’s become an international laughing stock.Leave campaigners lied and swaggered their way through the  referendum and reality has bitten them, hard. They – and they alone – must take responsibility for the chaos engulfing the Brexit process.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how uk scottish government rivalry could help extend borders railway alastair dalton","story":"Picking my way through ft-high trees along a stretch of the former Borders Railway, it was dficult to imagine I was walking on a line which once carried Edinburgh-London trains, let alone one on which the tracks could be relaid.South from its current terminus at Tweedbank, near Galashiels, the line to Carlisle, which closed  years ago, has largely been consumed back into the region’s landscape.Huge embankments are now covered in vegetation with the track bed invisible under farm tracks and paths, although the ballast which supported the wooden sleepers still lies just under the grassy surface.Among the only obvious signs of the route are bridges over roads, although a fair few have been removed, or sections under them filled in.A stretch in Melrose, just south of Tweedbank, has been used to bypass the town, but its station sits preserved by the roadside, aswaiting to receive its next passengers.Now that the re-opened line has become firmly established, with passenger numbers growing consistently since it opened in , that prospect is very much no longer a forlorn hope.The following year, the SNP made it an election manesto commitment to examine the feasibility of extending the former Waverley route to Hawick – the next obvious stage – and Carlisle.Last month, it featured among  potential schemes in a Borders transport corridors study, along with four others to improve the existing route or to extend it east to Berwick-upon-Tweed. By contrast, ten of the options – which will all be considered further – are for road or bus improvements.: Borders tourism threatened by ‘poor service’ on rail lineHowever, it appears one-upmanship between the UK and Scottish governments could accelerate the process. Not the first time the railways have benefitted from such cross-Border tussles.In , when the Scottish Government put out a devil’s advocate-sounding consultation that included an option to close part of the Caledonian Sleeper, Chancellor George Osborne offered £ million to upgrade the service instead -Scottish ministers followed suit.They did, pledging a “minimum” of £m – and claiming it “surpassed” Osborne’s stake. The upshot has been a brand-new fleet, to be launched in June complete with ensuite cabins, showers and double beds, which has surpassed most expectations.For the Borders line, the UK Government seems to have sought the upper hand by announcing last week its backing for a feasibility study into restoring the railway as part of the Borderlands Growth Deal, so long as the Scottish Government did too.Reacting to the news from Scottish Secretary David Mundell, in a letter to Borders Conservative MP John Lamont, Transport Scotland at the time only went as far as saying it “welcomes the opportunity to discuss potential joint funding for a detailed consideration of cross-borders transport links”. But yesterday, it told me it was actually one step ahead, having completed the “pre-appraisal” element of the process, which it said the UK Government had not - and was obliged to, to meet UK Treasury’s requirements.The outcome this time may well be less spectacular than for the Caledonian Sleeper, but it could at least see serious consideration given to the project sooner rather than later, and the incremental ambition of at least reconnecting Hawick to the rail network realised.

Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments.

Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House.

The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know.

Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though..."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dancing dentists scoop title","story":"A group of dancing dentists have secured a prestigious prize after their fundraising efforts raised #, for charity.Colleagues from the Bupa Dental Care Banbridge practice came together to waltz, tango, salsa and foxtrot, raising money for their long-standing charity partner, Make-A-Wish, which creates le-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses.In total, the charity event saw  couples hit the dancefloor to compete for success in front of a crowd of more than  people.

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age. Anyone who is not surethey are fully-vaccinated should check with their GP practice. If you haven’t had your kids vaccinated, contact your GP surgery to make arrangement for them to get the MMR and help to provide them and those around them with the best protection.”The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperaturea cough.To view the video see www.pha.site MMRvimeoFor more information on measles, mumps and rubella see www.pha.site mmr.PHA programme to tackle type  diabetes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pha programme to tackle type 2 diabetes","story":"A new programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes has been launched by the Public Health Agency. The programme has been developed as part of Northern Ireland#s approach to providing innovative services which have a focus on prevention and has been supported by investment from the transformation fund.Approximately , people are living with diabetes in Northern Ireland, a startling . per cent increase since . Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme. The facilitators offer advice and support to help you make changes to your lestyle and I quickly realised I was eating all the wrong foods and also too much of them. I’m six weeks into the programme and I’ve already lost a stone, I’m feeling better, my concentration levels have heightened and I feel fitter and well. I would urge everyone to go on the programme. It literally has changed my le.”Diabetes UK assistant director for local impact, Dr David Chaney, said: “We only have to look at the startling yearly increase in number of people being diagnosed with type  diabetes to know that we cannot ignore this very serious condition. We know that three in five cases of type  can be prevented or delayed by eating well, being active and achieving a healthy weight, so there is hope for the future. The more we know about diabetes the better we can fight it together, so find outyou are at risk and ask about your local diabetes prevention programme.”The diabetes prevention programme is currently up and running across all five trust areas. People can be referred to the programme by a nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge. It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type .For more information on the diabetes prevention programmeemail your local health trust.The ious emails are: diabetespreventionni@setrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@southerntrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@westerntrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@belfasttrust.hscni.net diabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.net.Nearly , have glaucoma Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"transport  ","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

Music and lyrics in the production are by Eurythmics legend Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, who co-wrote and produced Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, so I was looking really forward to hearing how they were going to move the story and action along.The production begins with idealistic couple Sam Wheat, played by Irish actor Niall Sheehy, and Rebekah Lowing in the role of Molly Jensen, a banker and an artist, just starting out on le after buying their first apartment together. Their lives are ripped apart after a mugging goes horribly wrong and Sam is shot dead leaving him ‘between’ here and the afterle. It is his need to protect Molly that drives him to not be welcomed by St Peter at the gates but to try find out what happened.The staging of the production is excellent, whether it’s capturing the New York skyline, taking us into the bowels of the city’s subway or to ‘psychic’ Oda Mae Brown’s palmistry studio just off the beaten track where Sam meets his ally – and a way to get answers.With such a tragic story, comic relief thankfully comes in spades with the introduction of Jacqui Dubois’ Oda Mae, a character brought so brilliantly to le when Whoopi Goldberg did the job onscreen. Jacqui and Niall work brilliantly together and her outlandish outfits are a sight to behold as she belts out ‘Are You a Believer’ to the sad souls coming through her door hoping for a connection to a loved one who has passed on. The use of theatrical trickery is extremely clever, especially when conveying the moment Sam is murdered and immediately becomes a ‘ghost’ or when trying to access a door or move pieces of furniture.A special mention must go to Sergio Pasquariello in his role as the couple’s shady friend Carl, who it becomes clear is in way over his head at the bank, and Jules Brown in his role as murderer Willie Lopez. Both bring menace to the stage and the message is that all is not what it seems no matter how much you think you know a person. Lovonne Zeus Richards is excellent in his role as the Subway Ghost who helps Sam realise how to use his death to his advantage in his quest for retribution.The finale is beautully staged as Sam and Molly get to – and have to – say their final goodbyes and we hear a stirring rendition from Niall Sheehy of The Righteous Brothers’ Unchained Melody – and it’s fair to say there was a bit of snuffling and snfling among the audience.Initially thought unstageable, Ghost The Musical really does work and with tickets limited throughout its week run it’s best to get them quick.Ghost The Musical runs at the Grand Opera House until Saturday April .

At the end of the current season, Sport and Leisure Swts will cease to exist and the club will change their name to Belfast Celtic. Sport and Leisure are locked in a relegation battle in the Bluefin Premier Intermediate League – the third tier of the Irish League. Relegation could see them move into the Ballymena and Provincial League, where fellow West Belfast sides St James’ Swts and Donegal Celtic currently play. However, in a surprise move, Belfast Media Group understands that the club is actively pursuing their options for next season which could see them apply for affiliation to the SSE Airtricity League . Sport and Leisure Swts are affiliated to the Irish Football Association and it was believed the new Belfast Celtic entity would simply take their place. Yet, the committee at Glen Road Heights are exploring their options with Belfast Celtic apparently free to join a dferent league.Clubs seeking to switch leagues would usually require permission from both bodies and it would be unlikely that the IFA would grant such a move. However, a club source expressed their view that the club could force a switch under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In any case, they may not need legal assistance as, strictly speaking, a new club under the name of Belfast Celtic will be formed next month when Sport and Leisure Swts ceases to exist. It is understood that the committee have already held preliminary talks with League of Ireland officials who would welcome a new member as long as the switch received the backing of the IFA. SSE Airtricity Premier Division side Derry City started off in the Irish League, winning the title in . Issues surrounding security during The Troubles forced them to play their home games in Coleraine before they dropped out of the Irish League. Following a number of years in junior football, they joined the League of Ireland in . Belfast Celtic would be an interesting addition to the League of Ireland should they go down that route. Following a long and protracted saga, Sport and Leisure had their application to change their name to Belfast Celtic approved by the board of the IFA last December having consulted with the Northern Ireland Football League, the Co Antrim FA and the Belfast Celtic Society.Sport and Leisure have endured a dficult campaign have find themselves at the foot of the table with just five games remaining. They have three games in hand over second from bottom Armagh City and the sides clash at Holm Park on Saturday afternoon. Packie McAllister’s men also face two games with Portstewart in the coming weeks.Sport and Leisure’s struggles this season have been exacerbated following a host of suspensions handed out to key players in the wake of their abandoned tie with Portstewart in January. Padraig Lynch and Stephen McAlorum are among those set toto action for Saturday’s crucial trip to Armagh, but goalkeeper Michael Magill remains suspended. McAllister’s men gave themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation after they battled back from three goals down to claim a vital point against Dollingtown last Saturday at Glen Road Heights.An own goal from Gavin Johnston and a double from Dollingstown’s Keith Johnston seemed to gave sealed the points for the visitors and the Swts suffered a further blow when midfielder Pierce Tully was dismissed. However, they mounted a rousing comeback in the final half hour and goals from Liam Carland, Ronan Carroll and substitute Ciaran McKissock levelled the game at -. Dollingstown were also reduced to  men when Richard Thompson was shown a red card in the closing stages.With Armagh suffering a - defeat to Moyola last Saturday, this weekend’s showdown with Sport and Leisure in Holm Park will go a long to deciding which side finishes bottom of the Premier Intermediate League. It just might not decide which league the West Belfast outfit will be playing in next season when they become Belfast Celtic."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local man loses out on internship over brexit","story":"A Lisburn man has spoken of how he has lost out on a prestigious European internship due to the implications of Brexit.-year-old Ruairí Fisher had successfully applied for an internship with the Scout Movement in Brussels, but was later rejected on the basis that he lives in the North of Ireland, which would be outside the EU in the event of Brexit.Despite Irish citizenship and membership of the all-Ireland Scouting Organisation, a spokesperson for the Scouts told Mr Fisher in an email correspondance that the “benchmark” for EU funding is “current residency” not “citizenship”.“Unless you get an Irish residence for the next six months, you would not be eligible,” the spokesperson added.Speaking to Daily Belfast, Mr Fisher said: “I was annoyed and disappointed that through no fault of my own I was rejected from the internship.“It seems that the people in Westminster and Europe don’t understand the terms of the Good Friday Agreement or the implications of Brexit on it. “I’m an Irish citizen, but because I live in a contested space my opportunities are jeopardized. Even though the terms of the Good Friday Agreement allow me to claim Irish citizenship, EU residency seems to be a sticking point for them.”He continued: “I think it raises questions about the wider impact of Brexit on people here. I think it will close opportunities for people here who want to work abroad or for students on Erasmus.“It will be a shameother people lose out on opportunities that could benefit their education and career.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sarsfields ace mckenna braced for toughest test against rossa","story":"NIALL McKenna says he is relishing the prospect of putting his shoulder to the wheel for Sarsfield’s again this season after spending last year in England.The dual star helped Warwickshire hurlers to last season’s Nicky Rackard Cup decider at Croke Park where they were defeated by Donegal in the final.McKenna was often a spectator at games last season and admitted he found it tough watching on as the Paddies struggled to match their exploits from their stunning  campaign when they annexed the Junior Football Championship and the Intermediate Hurling Championship.“I missed it. I was good being over there and playing for Warwickshire,” said McKenna.“At the same time, I wanted to be back home. It was hard watching Sarsfield’s playing when I came back knowing I couldn’t play Championship. It was hard to take. Our aim has to be to try and have a year like we had two years ago.“I think we should have a good shout. The Intermediategrade looks tough this year, but with the squad we have we should be capable of going well again.”On the football front, Sarsfield’s face neighbours Rossa at the Bear Pit tonightwith both teams bidding to build on their opening victories.Sarsfield’s defeated St Pat’s Lisburn by four points in round one in a repeat of the  JFC final while Rossa laid down a serious marker by defeating Aldergrove - to - in their Division Two opener, so McKenna is expecting a tough battle this evening.“This will be the hardest game we have in the ision,” said McKenna.“We have to play as well as we can and just worry about ourselves and don’t think too much about Rossa.“No matter who we play, we would fancy our chances at home so we have to play to the best of our ability and see where it takes us.“We had a good win over St Pat’s in our first game so we have to try and build that from.”Rossa manager Sean Fleming, meanwhile, expressed his satisfaction with their emphatic win over Aldergrove, but stressed that they will have plenty of competition for promotion this season.“ We were very pleased with it because when both teams were in Division One it was always a one-point game between us. It was good to start the season off with a win against a decent team,” said Fleming.“We hoped to make a quick escape from Division Two the last time we were in it and it didn’t happen for seven or eight years.“Just because you’ve dropped down from Division One doesn’t give you a right to think you’ll go straight back up. You’ve a lot of good quality teams in the ision and they want the same thing we do.”Fleming, like McKenna, is anticipating a close contest when Rossa and Sarsfield’s clash this evening.“It wouldn’t matterone of the teams were in Division One and the other were in Division Three, it is going to be a very close game,” added the Rossa boss, who is sweating on the fitness of Michael Armstrong, Richard Gowdy and Thomas Morgan.“This group of lads from both teams have grown up with each other. They would have faced each other at U, U and at minor and they were always very close games.“Sarsfield’s always play a good brand of strong, physical, competitive football.

The teaching group travelled to St Colm’s in Twinbrook in the hope of gaining some insight from the school’s renowned English department.The head of the Dutch group, Lisette Bentvelzen, enthused about the opportunities and knowledge they had already gained from the trip. Talking to the Andersonstown News, she said: “We are here on a study trip to educate ourselves but we have been given the chance to come to and see how a school like this works. It has been very interesting.”“We have seen some subjects here we would love to introduce into our school. Home Economics and Photography, we don’t have. These really specialised subjects would be lovely for us to have. It was also very interesting to hear about the school, the area it’s in and the high performance they achieve.”Stressing the educational value of the trip, Ms Bentvelzen lauded the staff, students and facilities. “The children are really lovely. We’ve been in several classes but we have not been teaching, because we are from a completely dferent school.“We’ve just been observing in class, listening in, and the teacher explains to us what they#re doing. I talked to one of the students in a Home Economics class while she was cooking and she was enjoying herself and she mentioned something interesting. She told me, ‘Ive been away for a while and I’ve realised I can’t miss classes too much because you miss so much.’ It’s lovely to hear that from students.”“Being in this school is very dferent for a lot of us. We have already been to a number of other schools, we’ve got some young colleagues with us and they haven’t seen this before, so it’s an eye opener, how dferent the education system is over here.”Principal Adrian Walsh echoed these sentiments, stating that the staff and pupils were “delighted” to showcase their facilities and school ethos to their visitors.“They came to us through InterEducation, who askedwe were willing to host a party of teachers from Holland as they were trying to improve English as a foreign language in their own setting.“We felt it was a fantastic opportunity for them to come and see what we do. We have fantastic belief in our young people, we have an excellent English department and we would like to showcase St Colm’s as an outstanding school particularly in our provisions of English. “We are delighted that they#re here and they’ve had an informative, enjoyable morning. It#s been a lovely event.”On the possibility of furthering this relationship, Mr Walsh remained hopeful, telling the Andersonstown News: “Maybe there’s a partnership possibility with the school. It would be good to have contacts in another country, just so that we can share our experiences and our practices with dferent cultures and so on. “There will be plenty that we can learn from them and maybe something they can learn from us.#"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The next morning Aaron noticed something in the corner of the room.“He’d be pretty high-tech so he called me and said ‘have a look at that’. It was a camera.“Then we started looking all over the house. There were cameras everywhere, even in the toilet. It was a big bathroom with a hot tub and a sauna.“There was a motion sensor camera in the corner watching everything, in the corners of the bedroom as well.“There wasn’t one room in that house that didn’t have a camera.“We called a meeting at the pool area and discussed what we were going to do because we didn’t know what we were dealing with.“We knew we needed to get out of this house. He would have been watching us and saw us taking photos of his cameras.“We just left as quickly as we could.”A spokesman for Airbnb said that it took immediate action against the homeowner and suspended his account.“We take privacy issues extremely seriously. As soon as we were made aware we removed this host from our  and fully refunded the guests,” a spokesman said.“We have strict standards governing surveillance devices in listings and take reports of any violations very seriously.“There have been more than half a billion guest arrivals on Airbnb to date and issues are incredibly rare.” data-dfpadtargetingThe Conroys holiday apartment.The family had spent just one night in the villa before they found the cameras, and had to organise accommodation for the remaining five nights.However, although Airbnb refunded them the money for the villa, the family said there was no compensation over the incident and they struggled to find accommodation that was of similar standard to the villa.“We went down to my sister’s place and rang Airbnb. The customer service really was appalling, really terrible,” Ms Conroy said.“I rang the police in Greece. They said there was nothing they could dowe stayed in the property they said maybe they could have. They just didn’t want to know.”The family forked out for a hotel which cost signicantly more as it was last-minute.They said that Airbnb should take some responsibility and look into its homeowners.“I looked through the reviews for the property later and saw that families with kids were staying there,” Ms Conroy said.“They were posting good reviews so obviously they didn’t even notice the cameras.”The revelations come a week after a New Zealand family revealed their horror at finding a hidden camera inside their Cork property after renting through Airbnb.Read MoreTourists in Irish Airbnb find hidden camera livestreaming from their room"},{"url":null,"title":"irish premier criticises former fai chief over unanswered questions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

that John Delaney provided it with a bridging loan to prevent it exceeding a . million euro bank overdraft.At a parliament committee hearing which took place over seven hours on Wednesday, FAI board members appeared unable to answer basic questions, including how many bank accounts the organisation has, and often refused to answer, citing legal or commercial limitations.Mr Delaney himself read a short statement at the start of the committee, then refused to be questioned further, citing legal advice, and sat in silence for the majority of the session.The appearance has sparked intense criticism of the board, as well as Mr Delaney himself, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stating on Friday that questions have gone unanswered.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  John Delaney did not answer questions at a parliament committee “I don’t think anyone would be satisfied by it, I think the public, taxpayers and football fans would have liked to have seen those questions answered,” Mr Varadkar said.“The truth is, he was within his legal rights not to answer those questions because he is not a public servant and therefore not accountable to the Oireachtas.“However, the FAI is accountable to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and is accountable to Sport Ireland for the public money they get.“I know those bodies will have questions to ask the FAI, which I think need to be answered and thus allowing us to do what we want to do, which is to restore funding to the FAI so the money flows once again to local clubs, to young people and to women in sport.”Mr Delaney has insisted he acted in the best interests of the game when he loaned the money to remedy a short-term cash flow problem.The organisation has hired financial firm Grant Thornton to investigate how the loan came about, despite three members of the board knowing about the loan when it was paid.The controversial payment, which has raised questions about the FAI’s finance and governance arrangements, was not flagged to Sport Ireland, the state body that oversees the public funding of sporting organisations in the country.Sport Ireland has temporarily withheld further funding to the FAI pending an auditor’s probe.On Thursday, The Professional Footballers Association Ireland called for a complete overhaul of the organisation after reviewing the board’s behaviour in the Irish parliament.A

Now this delay has wrecked our plans,” Mr Coyle said.“We have to sell off all the stuff that we had stockpiled and we have to stockpile again for October, but my worry is that Brexit can happen at any time. “It can happen in June when they review it, so how do I prepare  How do I manage that “The politicians are not helping the likes of me to prepare when they can’t even give us a date. Will October be the actual date, or will it be pushed down the road again ”Mr Coyle said he and other businesses in the Republic were taking no chances when it came to products manufactured in the UK and had filled warehouses with essentials to avoid empty shelves.“The items I have stockpiled are items that we can’t guarantee we will have on the shelvesa no-deal Brexit happens,” Mr Coyle explained. “Anything that is produced in Great Britain is stuff we have stockpiled. “That would be biscuits such as custard creams, which are manufactured in the Great Britain and brought across, and brands like Heinz.“Custard creams are very telling because they are something that only sell very well in the British Isles — Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales. They are only made in Manchester and a few factories in Great Britain. It’s not something where you can ring up France and ask them to send you a few containers of custard creams — they don’t make them anywhere . “You either have them in from your Great Britain factory, or you don’t have them at all.“I would have several pallets of custard creams and Bourbon creams stockpiled already. That would be almost , biscuits. “They all have a sell-by date, which is before October, and now I have to stop buying them from my supplier and sell what I have stockpiled. “That all has implications for the supply chain behind me.“Another thing we have been stockpiling is garlic bread. There is one factory in the North that makes all the garlic bread for the entire island of Ireland. “If there is a hard border and the customs go in and there are controls and lockdown on the border, all of a sudden the  counties are going to have dficulty sourcing fresh garlic bread. They will have to get it from France or find some other way.“Because the garlic bread is fresh, the day we can’t get it is the day we can’t get it. “We have had to compensate by stockpiling frozen garlic bread. We would have several hundred frozen garlic breads stored in our warehouse in Galway.“Now I have to be prepared to stockpile and buy it all in again for October. We don’t know the future and that is very dficult for us.”Mr Coyle hopes the UK will not leave the EU at all, but he feels that the current situation has left everyone “in limbo”.“I can see a lot of wrong things in Europe, but I certainly don’t want to leave it,” he said. “If there is anything that needs fixed, we will fix it from the inside.“With what has happened now, we are all completely in limbo. “You have all these guys getting paid thousands of pounds a week to sort it out, running around in suits trying to sort it out — and they need to sort it out. “I would hate to see the UK leave the EU, butthey are going, well then, go. At least then we would have some sort of clarity and would know what is happening.”"},{"url":null,"title":"assange should be brought to australia says father of wikileaks founder","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My son has gone strength to strength.“I don’t know anywhere  we could have such a lovely educations for our children.”The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell.  Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and .The school has been a part of the local community for over  years.  It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs part of a pre-publication consultation, the Education Authority is currently seeking any objections or comments on the proposed discontinuance of Groarty CIPS from the Board of Governors, parents and staff of Groarty CIPS and Trustees, and other interested parties in the local community.The consultation document makes reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S.It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daróige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places.The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school.Joint campusThe EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education.  And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daróige.Both schools made a joint submission under the Shared Education CampusesProgramme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.”At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.In justication of its proposed closure of Groarty CIPS, the EA said it believes other schools in the area can cater for the children’s educational needs and home-to-school transport will “mitigate against this impact” and provide for the safe transportation of pupils from the area to their nearest school.Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still not up and running, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The closing date for the consultation process is June  and for those who want to have their say, you can visit: www.eani.org.uk prepublication-consultations groarty-ips"},{"url":null,"title":"richard bolitho derry born dam buster commemorated city cemetery","story":"CAPTION: Derry born Richard Bolitho is pictured on the far right.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment. Nonetheless, the feasibility of doing so in the future is being examined, he continued.ldquoConfirmation that the use of modern technology to provide answers to parents and avoid a full invasive post mortem is also positive step.Mrs Anne Trainor, who was one of the first people to raise the issue of babies being sent to England for post-mortem, has welcomed Mr Pengellyrsquos letter.The experienced health campaigner, whose daughter Joanne sadly passed away in  aged four-and-a-half as a result of the Tricuspid Atresia heart condition, described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral.She continued: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le. You will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child.While Mrs Trainor believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, she admits she would also be in favour of an all island service.The contents of the Permanent Secretaryrsquos letter are due to be discussed at tonightrsquos meeting of the Down Community Health Committee int Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn, Downpatrick, at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

People have moved on and these types of actions are not acceptable and have no support in our community.ldquoThose responsible need to accept that they progress no-onersquos agenda but their own and the wider community will condemn this activity and call for it to cease.Local Sinn Fein councillor John Rice also condemned those responsible for the device.The Slieve Croob representative said: ldquoAs we approach the local government election, the only acceptable way to get your message across to the community is at the ballot box, not like this. This also seriously inconvenienced members of the public with the road closure, particularly schoolchildren trying to get to school.Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis has said he commended ldquothe diligence of the local resident who spotted the device and alerted emergency service.He said that it looked like the device was ldquopositioned to ambush and kill, adding: ldquoPolice should now begin to carry out local searches to establish where and how this device was constructed.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues. She was put on to a stretcher and whisked to safety to a police Land Rover waiting in a forest track.The other schoolchildren in the party were soon brought down to safety by Mr Hawkinsrsquo team and were given a change of clothing and a cup of tea at Newcastle police station.The second stranded group were rescued from the Commedagh area above Tollymore Forest. Two members of the party managed to make their way to Tollymore Mountain Centre to report that a  year-old girl had collapsed with exposure. She was brought down to a rescue vehicle by the others in her group and they were all taken to safety in a minibus.The Ardnabannon team handled the third rescue operation when children got into trouble at Lukersquos Mountain. A  year-old boy collapsed and a teacher who was with the party carried him on his back to meet the team.After the rescue operation was completed Mr Hawkins warned that a serious accident could occuryoung people continue to camp out in the Mournes during severe weather conditions.DOWNPATRICK mdash A Downpatrick couple had to escape through an upstairs window using a ladder when their house caught fire on Sunday afternoon.Mr and Mrs S McKeown, of Pegasus Walk, made their escape after they discovered their house was on fire at around pm. Local firemen were called to the scene and using breathing apparatus confined the damage to the living room. Damage to this area was extensive.Later in the evening firemen were called to Major Corbettrsquos home at Tyrella and had to remove the fireplace to prevent further damage. On Friday they had to attend a chimney fire at the home of Mr Sean Quinn, Pemberton Park, Downpatrick.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos mansion and -acre Montalto estate at Ballynahinch have been bought by a Belfast partnership for well over pound million within three weeks of the property being put on the market. The partners are two large and long established private companies, James P Corry  Co Ltd, the noted timber merchants and builders suppliers, and John Hogg  Co Ltd, Ulsterrsquos biggest flax merchants. Both firms have extensive involvements in the agricultural industry.Public reaction to the sale is cheerful as Montalto will continue to be run as an agricultural enterprise and will not be stripped of any of its assets.The future of the mansion will be carefully considered by the new owners.

But Ms Godfrey made it clear that this is not a viable option on a long term basis.Her letter adds: ldquoThe current marshalling area cannot operate as a self-policing facility due to restrictions of the road infrastructure within Strangford village.ldquoWe are currently exploring alternative arrangements to facilitate queueing vehicles and have agreed to work with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to bring forward options on this matter for consultation after the local elections.At the start of the year, politicians on both sides of Strangford Lough joined forces to help improve the busy waterwaysrsquos ferry crossing and address local concern.As part of a new initiative, they met with the arearsquos most senior roads official who is responsible for the service with two key issues dominating the agenda mdash an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry and the congestion in Strangford village caused by ferry traffic.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the commitment to investigate both areas of concern, explaining that the congestion in Strangford is particularly acute at times which impacts on residents and businesses.He said locals are keen to see drivers wishing to board the ferry using a dedicated lane which runs alongside the ferry terminal, with additional finance provided to enable staff to ensure the lane is used to combat the congestion problem.Cllr Curran continued: ldquoThere is a need for an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to meet the needs of people heading for work. The first sailing is always busy and many are left frustratedthey are not able to make it.It was reported recently that some workers are forced to leave their car in Strangford all week and travel as foot passengers on the first morning crossing from Portaferry to make sure they get across the waterway and on to their place of work.ldquoThere is a clear need for the earlier sailing and I fully recognise the need to ensure this does not create an unnecessary convenience residents when the ferryrsquos engines are started. The vessels which provide the crossing are both berthed in Strangford overnight, said Cllr Curran.He added: ldquoIt is important moving forward that we meet the needs of commuters, residents and business owners and come up with a solution that is agreeable to all.ldquoCongestion is a major issue given that vehicles can, at times, be queued from the ferry terminal back as far as St Josephrsquos Primary School at the Downpatrick Road which has a signicant impact on village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Loughinisland give RGU the blues with red hot show  ","story":"NEWLY-PROMOTED Loughininland encountered few problems when they opened their campaign in the top flight with a clinically effective win over an out of sorts Downpatrick at Pairc Tomas Ruiseil on Friday night.Downpatrick went into the game without several prominent players, but had they taken all their chances, then this could have been a dferent story altogether.Conor McGrady pointed Downpatrick into a third minute lead with a converted free, but the home side contrived to waste good possession with some wayward shooting.This deficiency allowed Loughinisland to draw level with a free from Stefan Mason in the th minute before the impressive Conor Megoran nudged the visitors ahead, a lead Jody Gormleyrsquos charges failed to relinquish.Stefan Mason had the ball in the Downpatrick net after  minutes when he left his marker for dead, but referee Gavin Corrigan ruled that he over-carried the ball.This didnrsquot stop Loughinisland reinforcing their superiority and two points from the roaming Rory Mason gave the visitors a - to - lead by the th minute.Ruairi Quinn, Downpatrickrsquos most potent attacker on the night, reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play before a flowing move involving Gary Stranney and Stefan Mason ended with Conor Megoran planting the ball in the Downpatrick net, - to - to Loughinisland.Quinn and Stefan Mason exchanged points as did Conor Megoran and Tom Smyth as Loughinisland took a convincing - to - lead into the half-time break mdash Downpatrickrsquos six wides to Loughinislandrsquos two told its own story.John McCarthy fisted Loughinisland into a six point lead at the start of the second half, just seconds after Downpatrick had wasted yet another scoring opportunity.McGrady and Rory Mason swapped points as Loughinisland continued to be the more effective in possession, although both sides gave hard-earned ball away far too easily on occasions.Downpatrick enjoyed a period of dominance in and around the middle of the park, but all they had to show for their endeavours was a solitary point from Quinn with Conor Megoran and Rory Mason picking off their hosts with some clinical finishing to put the visitors into a commanding - to - lead midway through the second half.Four unanswered points from Tom Smyth, Conor McGrady, Quinn and Colin Leckey left just four points in it with less than  minutes remaining, but good game management from Loughinislandsaw them close up shop in the final stages.A Stefan Mason free in the rd minute was followed by a stunning goal from the same player after he raced away, soccer-style, before beating Jonathan Deeny all ends up with an explosive finish to the net.Downpatrick: Jonathan Deeny, Nathan McShane, Damian Branf, Patrick Smyth, Ronan Murphy, Johnny Bell, Conor Doherty, Peter Turley, Conor McCarron, Conor McGrady , Sean Bell, Tom Smyth , Marty Robinson, Ruairi Quinnfor Smyth, Caolan Bentham for Shields.Loughinisland: Chris Turley, Peter Cochrane, Paddy Megoran, Sean Cochrane, Paul Digney, Dan Gordon, Jonny Flynn, Aaron McClements, Dahman OrsquoToole, Rory Mason , John McCarthy , Paddy McKenny, Ryan Stranney, Stefan Mason , Conor Megoran .

Sir Roger, a philosopher, was unpaid in the role. The commission is seeking to make our surroundings more attractive.Given that we need more buildings for things such as homes and businesses, and given that there is a limited amount of space, and given that it is expensive to build structures to a high quality, there is a real danger that we all end up living in progressively more ugly settings.Think of the most beautul buildings in Northern Ireland: Stormont, Belfast City Hall, Queen’s University, old churches, and so on. Most of them are old and were put up using materials and labour that would now be impossibly costly.Think then of the tiers of ugly, low quality, but necessary buildings, put up after the war, that stretch for mile after mile, and you get a sense of the problem’s scale.The effort to save Bank Buildings in the heart of Belfast after the Primark fire have shown a public desire to keep our best landmarks.Sir Roger was ideal in his role because he is a great thinker, who has written about the joys of le from art to wine to music, and also about fine architecture.He is a brilliant advocate of conservative principles who defends religious faith in an age of aggressive atheism, and other traditions. He has rightly questioned the catch-all phrase ‘Islamaphobia’ at a time when it is essential that we can freely criticise Islamic extremism.He has been sacked for comments made in an interview with the New Statesman, the full transcript of which is not yet released. The former Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire was behind this appalling decision. Sir Roger should be judged on a letime of endeavour, in which he has produced dozens of acclaimed books. Mr Brokenshire should have made clear that he was fully behind Sir Roger in his voluntary role.Ben Lowry: The DUP’s best hope now is that a new, tougher Tory leader comes inMichael Clarke: Ireland has lost run of itself in bid to stop Brexit, and will look foolish‘Brexit ’ follows Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: The DUP’s best hope now is a new, tougher Tory leaderJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"ben lowry the dup s best hope now is that a new tougher tory leader comes in  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Ben Lowry: The DUPrsquos best hope now is that a new, tougher Tory leader comes inNigel Dodds responds after Prime Minister Theresa May gave her statement in the House of Commons, London on the latest situation with Brexit on Thursday April .

Paterson and Arlene Foster MLA, with Diane Dodds MEP, speak with the media outside the European Commission following a meeting with Michel Barnier to discuss Brexit on Thursday April , . Mrs Foster was also very critical of Theresa Mays handling of Brexit. Photo: Stefan Rousseau PA WireA spokesman for the government said that it would continue to prepare for every eventuality but even so the decision was telling — and was meant to be so.Once again, the UK was sending a signal to the EU that it would do everything it could to avoid crashing out without an agreement.The government was endorsing almost the opposite course of action to the one recommended by Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, who advised it to seek a six month extension so that both sides, the UK and the EU, could prepare for an exit without an agreement — the risks of which, he said, had been greatly exaggerated.The phrase that has been said of Theresa May, that she would in realitytake a bad deal over no deal, in contrast to her pledge that she would prefer no deal to a bad deal, gets ever more pertinent.This is the exact time to step up preparations for ‘no deal,’ while working to seean agreement can be passed by MPs, but she won’t.DUP relations with Mrs May reached an all-time low this week.Nigel Dodds, Arlene Foster and Sammy Wilson all issued scathing criticisms of the prime minister.This is a high-wire strategy.Presumably it is intended to enhance the sense among backbench Conservative MPs that the DUP’s problem is with its current leader, not with it as a party, or with the Confidence and Supply agreement between the DUP and Tories.But given that Mrs May is theoretically safe in her tenure in Downing Streether Withdrawal Agreement does not pass , because she cannot be challenged again as Conservative leader until the end of the year, the danger is that such attacks entrench her in her determination to push through the backstop, perhaps with Jeremy Corbyn, in part to spite the DUP.If the DUP aim is to help create a mood in which a change of Toryleader becomes inevitable, perhaps due to overwhelming opposition among Tory MPs leading to her concluding she has to go, then it is a logical one. Light sentences let terrorists think they can continue to plot murderBen Lowry: The appalling sacking of the traditional philosopher Sir Roger Scruton Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The most likely way out of the backstop now is such a change in leader, who will countenance no deal . Such a change of leader is not a forlorn hope: the Cabinet is said to have split  to  recently in favour of no deal, as opposed to other likely options such as a long extension. Mrs May was in the minority.Another route to such a new Conservative leader is MEP elections that swing massively to pro Brexit candidates, and precipitate some form of parliamentary coup, perhaps also a general election that leads to a more eurosceptic Commons too.But the risk then for the DUP is that a more pro Brexit leader would push ahead with softer post EU arrangements for Northern Ireland than for Great Britain.The notion of dferent treatment for the Province, resulting in some sort of border in the Irish Sea, is now so entrenched in the thinking of the Westminster establishment that it might well be implemented in the event of no deal, let alone in less drastic scenarios.In other words, Irish hardball tactics have worked a treat.I was in Dublin recently and someone who moves in political circles there told me:relations are still excellent behind the scenes between London and Dublin. I winced at, but was not remotely surprised by, the thought that there has been no pushback from the UK in the last two years.It tells you everything you need to know about British weakness, and the risk of something constitutionally disastrous being imposed on NI in event of ‘no deal,’ due to a determination to placate guaranteed Irish fury in that situation — unless, as said, a stronger leader emerges. Might it be Sajid Javid  He has bucked the trend of Tory-led UK weakness on a few issues.Emma Little Pengelly’s tweet this week, reproduced above, was a rare example of explicit unionist criticism of Dublin. In the recent past unionist representatives have seemed all too keen to troop into Stormont talks with Irish officials, who push in a way that the NIO seems rarely to do in reverse.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: The appalling sacking of Sir Roger Scruton JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"orange order confirms july  venues for   ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+           TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Orange Order confirms July  venues for    Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Gemma MurrayEmail Published::Updated::Thursday  April Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

It is a custom which has been maintained for over  years, passed through generations, and will continue to be upheld for many years to come.”Mr Stevenson will be in attendance at the Ballyronan demonstration.The senior Orangeman added: “We continue to welcome an increasing number of international visitors to our celebrations who are keen to experience first-hand the spectacle of the biggest day in the parading calendar. “High calibre music provided by some of the finest marching bands will only add to the festival atmosphere. We look forward to another glorious Twelfth.”The  demonstrations on Friday  July , will be held in: Tandragee Belfast Lisnaskea Pomeroy Donemana Augher Coleraine Ballyronan Holywood Crossgar Rathfriland Kilkeel Larne Glenavy Carnlough Ballymena Ballymoney and Ahoghill.Northern Ireland electricity grid can now be run from state-owned Dublin control roomWarning that Northern Ireland farm subsidies could halve by  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingStricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant end like thisThese are the  bizarre items you can take on a plane from Belfast International AirportMan dies after three vehicle collision on NI roadlsquoIrsquoll stab you in your pregnant bellyrsquo, child tells NI teacherBomb scare in N.I. housing estate -

The council does a huge amount of work to promote the Vale as both a destination for visitors and a place for companies to do business.\"To be at the top of the list for a major operator that is looking to expand represents a vote of confidence from the sector for the Vale of Glamorgan and a vindication of this hard work.\"We look forward to discussing potential locations with Travelodge and hopefully announcing further developments in the near future.The other six locations to make the Travelodge Wales expansion programme are Aberystwyth, Pwllheli, Swansea, Tenby, Torfaen Blaenau and Wrexham.Collectively this expansion programme represents an investment of poundm for third party investors and will create  new jobs across Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

It is, in many ways, a hidden corner of Penarth with a unique and special character.\"The future plans for the house will no doubt be a subject of local interest and concern, but in the meantime a number of local people have expressed interest in forming a voluntary group called \"The Friends of the Kymin Park.\"This group would aim to promote enjoyment of the park as public pleasure grounds.\"Wed also invite both councils to keep us informed of developments so that \"the friends of the Kymin Park\" could also be a source of good information about arrangements of access and enjoyment of the park during the time that the park management negotiations are resolved,\" added Mr Parry.\"Anyone interested is welcome to come to a meeting on Tuesday at .pm in Foxys Deli,  Victoria Road, Penarth to discuss the formation of a group \"The Friends of the Kymin Park\", specically focused on supporting and developing public enjoyment of the park grounds.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

England will introduce a similar bill in .A public consultation, carried out in Wales in November  and published in January , found that out of , responses,  per cent of responses were behind a ban on wild animals in circuses.But a total of , of these responses were identical, from campaign group Born Free.More than  local authorities in the UK have a ban on animals in circuses, but the Vale council is not among them. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today.

Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/next2.jpg","title":"next  ni smes sees  sales surge","story":"Posted on Tuesday April  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s leading small and medium-sized businesses have seen a .% surge in sales in the last year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Next  is Ulster Business’s showcase of SMEs based across Northern Ireland, and follows directly on from the Top  Northern Ireland Companies list, ranking firms based on turnover from the latest filed accounts to Companies House.Turnover growth has surged among the businesses this year, adding up to £.bn across the , with this list of companies increasing turnover by .%, year-on-year.John Lavery of Grant Thornton, who helped analyse and compile the list, said: “The Next  is a fascinating insight into Northern Ireland business. “The list is a broad mix of household names and less well-known companies that are delivering over £bn in turnover and employment for more than , people.“These firms are the le blood of the NI economy, operating across the whole of NI and across a broad range of sectors. “The combined turnover of this group of firms is .% higher than a year previous.“This performance is all the more impressive when we think of the Northern Ireland economy as a whole, where aggregate turnover across all companies declined.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
