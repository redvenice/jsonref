[{"url":null,"title":"Why Kate Middleton isnt allowed run marathon","story":"The journalist met Kate at the 2017 London Marathon, which had picked Heads Together — the mental health initiative overseen by Prince William, Kate, and Prince Harry — as that year’s chosen charity.Gordon told Loose Women that she asked the Duchess if she would run the marathon, to which Kate answered: ‘Oh no, security and all that’, to which Gordon jokingly replied: ‘If I can do the marathon, you can.’With over 40,000 runners taking part in the 2018 race, it is clear that the security risk to members of the Royal Family would be far too great. However, we may see a Royal run a marathon yet—maybe.At the end of January 2017, Prince William told GMB reporter Sean Fletcher that he would like to run a marathon, with the reporter then saying: ‘I chatted to Prince William, and he has promised that he will run a marathon in Kenya sometime.’However, when Fletcher told this to Kate, she replied: ‘I’ll believe it when I see it!’Even though we may never see Kate Middleton run a marathon, we will always have the three-way sprint she, Prince William and Prince Harry ran at the start of February 2017. The Royals visited the Olympic Park to support runners who were training for that year’s London Marathon.Very quickly she was getting ready on the starting line to do a 100m sprint against her husband and brother-in-law. Unfortunately, the Duchess came in last behind William, with Harry crossing the finish line first.Tour de France 2018: All you need to know about the 105th editionNational Lottery results: Lotto draw for Wednesday, 4th JulyWorld Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester. He used only one gallon of unleaded petrol in his 850cc Perodua Nippa car up the M5 but to achieve the record had to go at only 35mph.Then in 2003 Mr Gough set another record by driving a Toyota Yaris 28 miles on just one litre of fuel."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/19/4DEBA25800000578-0-image-a-6_1530729083310.jpg","title":"Brit caver hailed magician convincing Thai officials bring hero divers boys","story":"    The missing Thai schoolboys and their football coach were in high spirits after being discovered by the two British ers  Vernon Unsworth (pictured, above) managed to convince Thai officials to allow the British underwater cave experts to enter the natural chimney and reach the schoolboys\u0027Everybody needs to pray\u0027: Trapped cave boys smile in new...Boys trapped in Thai cave `may be rescued in stages´Share this article\u0027He knew that the water was the problem so he told the rescuers where to put sand bags to stop it reaching the cave.

However, one senior official connected with the operation told The Times that he hoped it would begin imminently. The boys — aged from 11 to 16 — would be accompanied by professional ers.Edd Sorenson, of International Cave Rescue and Recovery, warned that swimming out of the cave would be extremely dangerous and that the boys might panic. As long as they know that we know where they are, they have food, a way to keep warm, water or filtration systems and light, it would be safest to wait it out,\u0027 he told the BBC.An American expat and ing instructor working with the navy rescuers said that helicopters were exploring the outside of the cave for areas where rescuers might be able to drill through rock and lift the boys out.Thai Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda has said the boys\u0027 only chance is to swim out through the flooded underground network and that swimming lessons will start on Wednesday or Thursday. He said on Wednesday: \u0027There are no other options besides getting them out through the flooded passages.\u0027Mr Unsworth, a British cave explorer based in Chiang Ra who was called in to help the rescue efforts, has said the next 24 hours is make or break for the boys."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/20/4DEC3B8F00000578-5918823-James_was_photographed_walking_along_the_deck_of_the_yacht_in_Po-a-80_1530731662068.jpg","title":"LeBron James family continue vacationing yacht Italy days Lakers deal","story":"    LeBron James is still vacationing in Italy with his family.

Then: Pat\u0027s great-grandfather, Walter Taylor (pictured) and his wife, Ellen, bought the property (now on the market for £425,000) for £130 in 1918Their shop, part of which dates from 1663, sells food, wine and anything else one could need at short notice, oh, and ham sliced to order.Homemade cakes, too, that fly off the shelves — Pat out-sources cake production to her friend Tina Evans, admitting that her own efforts in this regard have been less than wholly successful.\u0027This is the heart of the community and we feel very much a part of people\u0027s lives,\u0027 says Pat, who still sleeps in the small bedroom she was born in.\u0027I will miss that. If someone is poorly you ask how they are, and if someone does not turn up for their paper in the morning, someone who is elderly and lives alone, say, then you check up on them to make sure everything is okay.\u0027Pat\u0027s daughter Kim, 32, and son Robert, 33, are not interested in becoming the fifth generation of their family to run the post office, both having children and careers.They still live locally, though. Kim is still in the village and works for an internet stationery company while Robert, who works for a building society, lives 20 minutes away.          Now: Pat stands in the same spot outside the post office as her great-grandfather a century laterThe Riachs hope to sell the business to a young family. \u0027It is up for sale because neither of my children want to take it on,\u0027 says Pat. \u0027It has been an idyllic existence in many ways, but they have also seen that it is a hard life.\u0027We used to do Sunday mornings but found we had no life at all. Rod gets up at 5.30 and makes me a cup of tea. I get up at 6.30. Before this year, the last time we had a full week off was for our honeymoon, 36 years ago.\u0027But she still recommends the post office as an escape from modern life. \u0027It would suit a family who are looking for a change — it does take up a lot of time but there is so much to enjoy in the day. You are not going to die of stress here.\u0027Pat\u0027s great-grandfather, Walter Taylor and his wife, Ellen, bought the property (now on the market for £425,000) for £130 in 1918. Two years earlier, Walter had lost his left arm in a threshing machine accident and used to hold down books of stamps with the hook that replaced it while tearing them out with his right hand. Three postmen were employed — two on bikes and one on foot — and Walter inspected them each morning to ensure their uniforms were spotless.One of the three was a Mr Marshall, who was known to let the side down on occasion, his weakness for cider causing him to crash into ditches while delivering mail.          Family tradition: Walter and Ellen Taylor\u0027s daughter Doris and her husband George Saunders took over the management of the sub-post office in 1942Ellen died in 1941 at the age of 77 and Walter followed in 1944 at the age of 79 — he had been determined to stay alive to see D Day.In 1942, their daughter, Doris, took over the management of the sub-post office, running it with her husband, George Saunders. They were followed in 1950 by their daughter, Margaret, and her husband, William Westbrook.\u0027The village has more than doubled in size since I was a child,\u0027 says Pat. \u0027It was a slower world then, in the Sixties. Things like vinegar and pop arrived in big containers and you had to bring your own glass bottles to fill up.\u0027In some ways it was more environmentally friendly. People did not have so many cars and they did their main shop in the village — there were two grocers\u0027 shops and a butcher\u0027s, as well as the post office — and they grew a lot of their own vegetables.\u0027Now, everyone drives to Gloucester or Cheltenham to the supermarkets, or they have it delivered after ordering online.\u0027People come in today for things they have forgotten to buy on a big shop, but it\u0027s still a good business. And as a village we do like our bottles of wine.\u0027          Service: Margaret and William Westbrook became the third generation of the family to run the sub-post office in 1950Ashleworth was a place of work up to the Seventies, home to a big saw mill that provided the family\u0027s shop with plenty of custom. But with its closure the village transformed into a mainly dormitory settlement, residents driving to work in Gloucester, Cheltenham and beyond. In recent years executive homes have sprung up to cater to this new demographic.But today, home-working is becoming more common, a modern electronic incarnation of the cottage industries of the past.\u0027Quite a few people work from home now and they rush in with packages to send just before the last collection at 5.20,\u0027 says Pat.As older residents have died off, so younger members of old village families have moved away in search of jobs — and because of rising house prices. A four or five-bedroom house in Ashleworth can now cost £500,000.\u0027A lot of people stay behind their doors and don\u0027t take part in village life, which is a shame —although there is a group of newcomers who do join in,\u0027 adds Pat. \u0027And the primary school is doing well — it has only 40 pupils but it\u0027s brilliant. It is still a gentle way of life — Ashleworth isn\u0027t commercialised like the chocolate box villages in the Cotswolds. We are off the beaten track.\u0027And endowed with a brilliant old (and not kitsch) pub, the Boat Inn. Owned by the Jelf family since the 17th century (they like to keep businesses in the family in Ashleworth) it is named after a ferry crossing on the River Severn. Charles II was said to have used this service when escaping Cromwell\u0027s forces following defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651.Locals at the Boat Inn passionately hope the post office survives. \u0027Everyone goes in there — it\u0027s a real little hub,\u0027 says barmaid Jo Minter. \u0027There are quite a lot of older people in the village and it is very advantageous for them.\u0027The local post office is a staple of British life, but branches have dwindled from about 25,000 in the mid-Sixties to some 11,500 today, although that figure has remained fairly stable for the last decade.About 98 percent of post office branches are \u0027agency\u0027 outlets, operated by franchise partners, like WHSmith, or sub-postmasters, like the Riachs, who are independent business people. A small number of \u0027Crown post offices\u0027 are managed by the state-owned Post Office Limited, which was hived off from the Royal Mail. In return for Government funding, the Post Office is required to ensure that 99 percent of the UK population live within three miles of a branch, and 90 percent within one mile.As Crown and agency branches have been cut, \u0027outreach\u0027 services — mobile offices or pop-ups using church and community halls — have grown in number.If no one takes on Ashleworth sub-post office residents will have to travel two miles to a branch in Hartpury. Hard if you are elderly and restricted to the bus. Something else will be lost — a place to bump into each other, to swap news and simply pass the time.

Miller...Star choreographer Dame Gillian Lynne who worked on Cats and...Share this articleLeonowens became a publishing sensation in the 1870s with two memoirs — The English Governess At The Siamese Court and its sequel, Romance Of The Harem.Her salacious and barbaric revelations about Siamese slaves and concubines shocked and titillated readers in Britain and in North America.She also claimed she became the king’s personal secretary, discussing foreign policy and how to deal with the European powers threatening Siam’s independence.When Mongkut died in 1868, his son and heir (her pupil) demanded an end to slavery and the humiliating tradition that subjects prostrate themselves before him — both aspects of Siamese culture that Leonowens had railed against.In her books she revealed that the king’s harem of 32 wives and concubines lived in an ‘inner palace’ guarded by 9,000 female slaves, officials and soldiers.But she claimed the harem wasn’t sufficient for the king’s prodigious sexual appetites — he annually purchased ‘choice’ Chinese and Indian girls for his harem.Leonowens described a ‘charnel house of quick corruption’ which was also home to ‘hiding vice of every vileness and crime of every enormity — at once the most disgusting, the most appalling and the most unnatural that the heart of man has conceived’.Those claims were roundly disputed by Alfred Habegger, author of an authoritative 2014 biography of Leonowens. He insisted life in the palace was not nearly so cruel or depraved as she made out.He says slaves were more like Western servants, even if they were tattooed with their owner’s name. As for the harem, he believes Leonowens was regurgitating exaggerated travellers’ tales and palace gossip.Besides, he added, skinny King Mongkut was hardly a macho Yul Brynner figure. In his late 50s by the time he met Leonowens, the king had lived most of his adult life as a celibate Buddhist monk — and is unlikely to have been the sex addict she describes.So why did Leonowens create such extravagant lies about the Siamese court? Aside from the obvious answer that it was good for sales, her biographer suggests clues lie in Leonowens’ own unhappy story, in which, having sacrificed her own financial security for love, she came to despise any system where women were sexual chattels with children arriving as if on a production line.Perhaps she hated the privileged king, her biographer speculated, because his life was so different to hers — she’d had to fight for everything, even to the extent of ‘inventing herself from scratch’.Far from being the upper-crust, boarding-school educated English woman that she claimed, Leonowens came from the wrong side of the British Empire’s tracks.A poor, mixed-race Anglo-Indian, Leonowens had never been to England. Raised in Bombay, she was considered a second-class citizen because of her colour.Reinventing herself, Leonowens eventually convinced everyone (including her grandchildren) that she had been born in Caernavon in Wales in 1834 to a Capt Thomas Crawford who died in the Sikh Wars, leaving his family in India.In fact, she was born three years earlier to a mother who was the offspring of a British army lieutenant and his Indian mistress.Her father was a London-born Indian Army private who died before her birth, and Leonowens was sent to a charity school for mixed-raced children in Bombay.Despite her lowly status, Leonowens could still have wed above her station as women were in short supply in India. Instead, she defied her family and married for love. Her husband, Thomas Leon Owens, was an army clerk with idealistic views and no money.After he left the army, the couple eked out a straitened existence, first in Western Australia, then on the Malayan Peninsula. They had five children, three of whom died, and Owens died in 1859. It was a very different tale to the one Anna Leonowens, as she later called herself, claimed about her husband.An army major, she said they lived in well-heeled St James’s, London, before moving to the East where he died in a tiger hunt.Rather than remarry, strong-willed Leonowens decided to open a kindergarten in Singapore, but life was still hard.Salvation came when she learned King Mongkut of Siam was looking for a qualified English teacher. This privileged position offered Leonowens the perfect chance to make her mark very publicly as an English lady — claiming her skin colour was the result of many years exposed to the tropical sun.Sending her older child to a London boarding school, Leonowens set sail for Bangkok in 1862 with her six-year-old son, Louis.Much of the grittier details of her life there were missing from the Rodgers \u0026amp Hammerstein musical for which Brynner won an Oscar.It was based on Anna And The King Of Siam, a 1944 book about Leonowens by Margaret Landon.Thailand — as Siam became in 1939 — was outraged by the mockery of its revered king as an autocratic buffoon, and to this day the musical and a 1999 non-musical version are banned there.Thai officials claim Leonowens probably never even met the king. But Habegger found correspondence showing the pair had heatedly discussed Thai slavery and Western free market principles.In the musical, Mongkut dies with Leonowens kissing his lifeless hand. But she left Thailand a year before the King’s death in 1868. However, at their final meeting, according to a witness, Mongkut acknowledged their fiery relationship and hoped she would come back. She never returned.Was there ever anything more between them? Considering how unpleasant Leonowens was about him in her memoirs, it’s unlikely she harboured romantic feelings.But years later — when she was living in Montreal and active in improving women’s education and getting them the vote — she told a friend the King had once given her a large diamond ring to symbolise his readiness to raise her ‘even to royal dignities’. True or false? Probably the latter.It’s difficult not to have a sneaking admiration for Anna Leonowens, who died, aged 83, in Canada, still insisting she was an English lady.A dogged survivor who managed to break through the repugnant racial barriers of the British Empire, she created a legend that will continue to delight audiences for years to come. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/04/4DEFA13D00000578-5919637-image-a-117_1530761039669.jpg","title":"New York leads Independence Day celebrations","story":"    Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday          Fireworks explode near the One World Trade Center tower, center, during the Jersey City Fourth of July celebration, Wednesday, in New York          Fireworks soared over New York City in the nation\u0027s biggest display to celebrate Independence Day, marking America\u0027s 242nd birthday  Americans across the US celebrated Independence Day with backyard barbecues, parades and fireworks on Wednesday (pictured is the display in NYC)  From New York to California, July Fourth festivities ranged from the lively and to the lighthearted, with Macy\u0027s July Fourth fireworks and Nathan\u0027s Famous hot dog eating contest (the Macy\u0027s fireworks display in New York City)          With the New York City skyline in the background, fireworks explode during an Independence Day show over the East River           Spectators watch a fireworks display on the east side of Manhattan borough, as part of Independence Day festivities Wednesday           A person stands on top of an apartment building in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J., to watch the fireworks           Resident in The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City took to their roofs to capture footage of the fireworks display in New York City           In New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkle and ahhhh with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcastIn New York, the Macy\u0027s fireworks show over the East River kicked off its 25 minutes of sparkles and ahhhhs with the West Point Band and entertainers including Kelly Clarkson, Ricky Martin and Keith Urban on NBC\u0027s broadcast.More than a million people lined the streets, packed onto roofs and stood on their balconies along the banks of the East River to catch the 42nd annual Macy\u0027s Fireworks display this evening.At least 3,000 pyrotechnic shells, in 25 different colors, were fired every minute during the 25 minute extravaganza - all synchronized to patriotic tunes and watched over by 50 pyrotechnicians.At its height, the display reached 1,000 feet - three times higher than the Statue of Liberty.

Begun in 1785, the Bristol parade typically attracts about 100,000 people to the seaside town. This year\u0027s was a scorcher with temperatures  near 90 degrees when the parade kicked off Wednesday morning. The sweltering heat even saw some marchers treated for heat exhaustion and taken off the route.However, the celebrations were a little muted in some Western states where the recent hot weather and wildfire danger forced communities to cancel fireworks displays. In Colorado, the wildfire danger forced some communities to cancel their fireworks. But in the small mountain town of Silverton, in southwestern Colorado, the celebration was still on, including live music and a water fight with firefighters. Aspen will have a fire-proof drone light display above town.Other fireworks shows also went ahead  in Denver, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins.

Bees are at risk from climate change because more frequent droughts could cause plants to produce fewer flowers, researchers sayThe research, carried out in collaboration with the University of Manchester and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, was published in the journal Global Change Biology.Ben Phillips, of the Environment and Sustainability Institute on the University of Exeter\u0027s Penryn Campus in Cornwall, was joint lead researcher for the work.\u0027The plants we examined responded to drought in various ways, from producing fewer flowers to producing flowers that contained no nectar,\u0027 he said.\u0027But overall there was a very clear reduction in the number of flowers that were available – and obviously this means less food for flower-visiting insects such as bees.\u0027Bees are already under pressure from threats including including habitat loss, the use of particular pesticides and the spread of diseases.Dr Ros Shaw, of the University of Exeter, said: \u0027Not only are these insects vital as pollinators of crops and wild plants, but they also provide food for many birds and mammals.\u0027The study took place in Wiltshire on chalk grassland, an important habitat for UK pollinator species.Plant species studied included meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), common sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and selfheal (Prunella vulgaris).Dr Ellen Fry, from the University of Manchester, said: \u0027Previous studies of the impacts of drought on flowers and bees have looked at inidual species, often in the laboratory, but we used an experiment with rain shelters to examine the effects on real communities of plant species living in chalk grassland.\u0027The level of drought that we looked at was calculated to be a rare event, but with climate change such droughts are expected to become much more common.\u0027Results of the study suggest that chalk grasslands may support lower pollinator populations in the future.However, the scientists warned the findings are likely to be broadly applicable to other regions and habitats.The research was part of the Wessex Bioersity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability project, and was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/11/4DF1DD9100000578-5920565-image-m-73_1530784918685.jpg","title":"Three poachers EATEN lions trying hunt rhinos South African nature reserve","story":"    Dinner in sight: Lions at the Sibuya Game Reserve which would have been among those that devoured three rhino poachers this week          Gruesome:  Staff found a head, along with a number of bloodied body parts and limbs at the scene along with three pairs of empty shoesStaff at Sibuya also found high powered hunting rifles with silencers, wire cutters and an axe used by poachers to cut off rhino horns.A helicopter was called in to search for more possible poachers, but none have so far been found.Karachi\u0027s cruel cages: African lions are ravaged by fungal...Never too young to kill: Trophy hunter CHILDREN pose...EXCLUSIVE: \u0027Men don\u0027t get the grief!\u0027 Hunter who posted...Share this articleOwner Nick Fox, 60, said: \u0027We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more.\u0027They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.\u0027But the lions are our watchers and guardians and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal.

He said the final reading of economic growth for the first quarter (pictured far right), which was revised up from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent last week, confirmed his view of the UK\u0027s  positive trajectoryOutlining the success of the Bank\u0027s Brexit contingency measures, he said: \u0027By the first quarter of this year, UK GDP had increased by 1 percentage point less than the MPC had projected just prior to the referendum.\u0027This is despite the fact that Brexit has not happened yet and that UK financial conditions have remained supportive since the referendum, in contrast to previous periods of elevated uncertainty.\u0027This in part reflects the package of easing measures implemented by the MPC in August 2016 and less stringent fiscal policy as well as the resilient global environment.\u0027But turning directly to President Trump\u0027s actions, Mr Carney added: \u0027In a general trade war, it is unlikely that global financial conditions would prove as robust, or that monetary policy could be as supportive.\u0027 Economic models by the Bank of England show that a 10 percentage point rise in tariffs between the US and all of its trading partners could knock 2.5 per cent off US output and 1 per cent off global output.\u0027The hit to global and UK GDP (gross domestic product) would be substantially greater if everyone put up tariffs against everyone else,\u0027 the governor warned.

Once, team mates overheard him telling Jordan he wouldn\u0027t make it with his attitude - to which the goalie replied \u0027I bet I will\u0027. Ball said: \u0027He thought he was the best. He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that. He challenged me.\u0027And, on the morning of his senior debut at Sunderland Pickford called his former coach, just to say thank you. Pickford is expected to start in England\u0027s game against Sweden on Saturday."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/19/4DEBA25800000578-0-image-a-6_1530729083310.jpg","title":"Brit caver hailed magician convincing Thai officials bring hero divers boys","story":"    The missing Thai schoolboys and their football coach were in high spirits after being discovered by the two British ers  Vernon Unsworth (pictured, above) managed to convince Thai officials to allow the British underwater cave experts to enter the natural chimney and reach the schoolboys\u0027Everybody needs to pray\u0027: Trapped cave boys smile in new...Boys trapped in Thai cave `may be rescued in stages´Share this article\u0027He knew that the water was the problem so he told the rescuers where to put sand bags to stop it reaching the cave.

Soldiers, rescuers and doctors are on standby to rescue the schoolboys and their football coachRescuers have been reluctant to be drawn on when the evacuation might be attempted from the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai. However, one senior official connected with the operation told The Times that he hoped it would begin imminently. The boys — aged from 11 to 16 — would be accompanied by professional ers.Edd Sorenson, of International Cave Rescue and Recovery, warned that swimming out of the cave would be extremely dangerous and that the boys might panic. As long as they know that we know where they are, they have food, a way to keep warm, water or filtration systems and light, it would be safest to wait it out,\u0027 he told the BBC.An American expat and ing instructor working with the navy rescuers said that helicopters were exploring the outside of the cave for areas where rescuers might be able to drill through rock and lift the boys out.Thai Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda has said the boys\u0027 only chance is to swim out through the flooded underground network and that swimming lessons will start on Wednesday or Thursday.

Begun in 1785, the Bristol parade typically attracts about 100,000 people to the seaside town. This year\u0027s was a scorcher with temperatures  near 90 degrees when the parade kicked off Wednesday morning. The sweltering heat even saw some marchers treated for heat exhaustion and taken off the route.However, the celebrations were a little muted in some Western states where the recent hot weather and wildfire danger forced communities to cancel fireworks displays. In Colorado, the wildfire danger forced some communities to cancel their fireworks. But in the small mountain town of Silverton, in southwestern Colorado, the celebration was still on, including live music and a water fight with firefighters. Aspen will have a fire-proof drone light display above town.Other fireworks shows also went ahead  in Denver, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins.

Yet it is impossible not to come away spellboundIf I were an artist invited to exhibit alongside Rembrandt, what would I say? I hope I’d have the humility and good sense to refuse. The bit of me that likes the paintings of Glenn Brown wishes he’d done the same.This artist, whose ornate, glossy oils pastiche everything from the covers of sci-fi novels to the paintings of – you guessed it – Rembrandt, said yes. He also agreed to appear in a film that introduces the Scottish National Gallery’s blockbuster exhibition tracing how British collectors, critics and artists have seen Rembrandt over the last four centuries.Who cares what Brown thinks about Rembrandt once you’ve seen his glib postmodernist exercises near to some of the most profound works of art ever created? Where Rembrandt used oil paint to probe the deepest recesses of existence, Brown creates self-conscious, fussy parodies full of perverse arabesques that stay steadfastly on the surface. His true master is not Rembrandt but Salvador Dalí, who might have happily put his signature to Brown’s ingenious yet utterly empty etchings of Rembrantesque heads. Then again, Dalí would sign almost anything.Brown’s chic art-world nonsense does, however, serve a purpose in this ambitious and flawed show. It makes you ponder what Rembrandt has that is so elusive. For Brown is technically clever. He homes in on a real quality in Rembrandt: his painterly indulgence and extravagance. The golden robe of the ruler of Babylon bulges with jewels of light in Belshazzar’s Feast, lent by London’s National Gallery. It is one of the richest surfaces ever painted. Yet here it is mirrored by other Rembrandt masterpieces. A Man in Armour (Achilles), painted in 1655 and today owned by Glasgow City council, is a stupendously atmospheric image of a knight. Arthurian dreams glimmer in the reflected light on this sombre warrior’s twilit armour as his face broods in shadow on dragons and damsels. Even to describe these works is to glimpse what Brown is missing. Rembrandt’s fancy effects are never just fancy. He doesn’t do art for art’s sake. Portrait of an Elderly Man was painted in 1667, two years before his death, when mortality filled his mind. There’s a slapdash freedom to the way Rembrandt has laid on the fleshy colours to build a flushed face and meaty hands that bulge out of black sleeves and white cuffs like smears of paté. Is he having a laugh? There was a genre of painting in 17th-century Holland called the tronie, a kind of fictional portrait or fantastical head. This painting has a tronie-like aspect but it brings you tragically to earth. It is a study of a florid, unhealthy looking man who relishes life but could quit it any second. This painting will probably have a heart attack before the exhibition ends.Portrait of an Elderly Man is a loan from the Mauritshuis in The Hague, but it was in British collections until it was sold to the Dutch museum in 1999. Where was the export ban and Save It for the Nation appeal? The UK has some of Rembrandt’s greatest paintings, yet the loans from abroad reveal we once owned more. The saddest of those departures was the sale of Rembrandt’s greatest landscape, The Mill, in 1911. This incomparably atmospheric vision of a solitary Dutch windmill catching the last rays of the sun on its sails under black clouds that spread like ink through a green and blue sky was painted in the 1640s and came to Britain in 1792. When its aristocratic owner decided to sell, an appeal to save it for the National Gallery failed and it is now owned by Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art instead.It was when I saw The Mill in the catalogue for this exhibition that I knew I had get to Edinburgh quick. It is a wondrous blot of colour that stays in your mind like a ghost. It even anticipates Monet in the impressionistic way Rembrandt observes a tree-lined horizon and its reflection in a river. JMW Turner felt the same: he revered and set out to rival this painting, whose daring helped him on his own artistic journey towards abstraction.This, unfortunately, is the kind of trick that Rembrandt: Britain’s Discovery of the Master misses. Interspersed with a stunning yet smallish gathering of Rembrandt’s paintings, it tells a slightly rambling story of how the British have seen his work since his own time. But when it gets a chance to show a real creative spark between the Dutch master and his British fans, it fluffs it. The Mill could easily have been shown next to paintings by Turner and Constable to demonstrate how it helped inspire a Romantic revolution. Instead we get too much detail about collectors and their minutiae of taste. You could come away thinking the British are not good enough to deserve all the Rembrandts in our collections – were it not for the very end. If Brown looks daft next to Rembrandt, there are two British greats here who more than survive the comparison. That’s because Leon Kossoff and Frank Auerbach have looked deep into Rembrandt’s darkness all their lives. The manic thickness of their paint, pitched between abstract expressionism and raw reality, is a contemporary answer to Rembrandt’s unmasked pathos. The almost childlike intensity and vulnerability of Kossoff’s 1982 painting From Rembrandt: A Woman Bathing in a Stream shows why, in his ability to see and portray the fragile wonder of being alive, Rembrandt will always be our contemporary.

You can’t change the facts, but you can polish them.”According to Langford, whose debut book, In Your Defence, tells the hidden story of 11 trials in the UK’s criminal and family courts, there isn’t much difference between setting a case before a jury or preparing one for the page: “We all love stories, we all love being told stories. That’s very much part of the trial, working out whose story you prefer.”The portraits she assembles, of people caught up in austerity Britain’s creaking justice system, are sufficiently vivid that In Your Defence has already been snapped up by Working Title for a television adaptation. There’s a man accused of drug dealing, kidnapping and false imprisonment after a friend persuades him to drive a couple of mates to Southampton, and a woman born in Bangladesh trying to prevent her violent husband winning custody of their child. There’s a woman charged with conspiracy after a burglary, and a young man accused of assaulting three police officers during an arrest that leaves him with cuts and bruises on his hand, ribs and head. Each case brings a change of cast and scenery, but one constant remains: there’s never a sharp iding line between innocence and guilt. “Life is not binary,” Langford says. “There is very rarely a situation where there is no other version of the story.”Born in the comfortable, cobbled cathedral town of Winchester, Langford was written off at school – her headmistress baldly declaring in a letter her pupil wasn’t supposed to see that she would “never be a high flier”. But Langford couldn’t shake the idea of a job where words were the tools of the trade. So when she finished her English degree in 2002, she sat her parents down at the kitchen table and declared she wanted to become a barrister. “It’s going to take a long time,” she told them. “I’m going to be living at home for longer than you had hoped, but I really want to try.”With no family connections, no old school tie or Oxbridge first, Langford knew her route to the bar would have to be a little unconventional, so she started at the local pub. She’d been working shifts at the Wykeham Arms since sixth form, but when she realised it was a haunt for all the lawyers appearing at Winchester crown court, she asked to be transferred to its hotel reception. Chatting to the barristers as they arrived, Langford began to build up a network that stood her in good stead when she came to apply for a pupillage. “I was quite tactical about it,” she explains. “I knew where it was sensible to apply. There was absolutely no point in me applying to a massive set in London that had thousands of applications.”A pupillage followed in 2005, with tenancy a year later, throwing Langford straight into the career spent hurrying from one case to the next that In Your Defence describes. Constructing a persuasive defence requires a balance between empathy and detachment, Langford says, a balance that barristers must constantly work to maintain as they parachute into the most desperate moments of their clients’ lives. “You have to learn to drawbridge your emotions because there’s another case the next day and you can’t take it all on, it’s too much … If it goes wrong then you end up like all the barristers on the telly, who go home and drink two bottles of wine every night.”Langford says she’s part of a generation of lawyers who are discovering, like 21st-century doctors and teachers, that it is possible to “have emotions and do a job”, that you can be “both professional and a human being … You have to look after your client at the expense of yourself, and I think that’s right. But we also have to learn how to cope with the fallout.”The legal profession may be catching on to the emotional cost of the disturbing material that is the barrister’s daily business, but Langford says the bar is still “way behind” when it comes to gender equality. “We obviously don’t get any maternity pay because we’re all self-employed, there’s no HR department, there’s no one to say, ‘Don’t you think you should give some of the really good junior briefs to some of the women?’” Women have to suppress their gender and their personality, she continues. “You have to be a machine, which is why I don’t wear nail varnish, lipstick or racy tights.” At the same time there’s an expectation that women deal with cases involving sex, partly to avoid the spectacle of a portly gentleman in a wig cross-examining a vulnerable witness. “In one respect your gender is removed, in another it’s exploited.”When Langford became pregnant in 2014, the profession’s difficulties over gender became all the more clear. She knew she wanted to have a second child but felt she couldn’t ask solicitors for work only to tell them that she couldn’t see a case through because she was pregnant again. “You have to be very careful about being blacklisted for things like that.”Four years on, Langford confesses she’s both itching to get back to a job she loves and worried about its emotional toll: “It’s terrifying because I don’t want to harden myself against my children. I don’t want to have to toughen myself so much that I’m unable to drop that when I go home. I don’t know how that’s going to pan out, but I trust in the fact that other people have done it and therefore it must be possible. You just have to learn to do it.”Although she has taken care to disguise the identity of each client who appears in her memoir, Langford says she agonised over publishing under her own name. “I didn’t sleep for about three months, because I thought I was going to get struck off.”Solicitors may prove wary of instructing a barrister who writes about her clients, but even though it was her love of words that inspired her to take up the law, she isn’t sure she’s ready to become a writer. “I think my agent would say, ‘She’s going to,’” Langford throws her head back and laughs. “That option is on the table now in a way that I didn’t think it would be, even when I was writing the book.” The laughter has stopped, and she carries on with a glint in her eye: “I’m sure I can do both.”In Your Defence by Sarah Langford (Doubleday, £16.99).

Cable said he knew JLR boss Ralf Speth from his tenure as business secretary and that the German boss of the carmaker was “not bluffing” when he said on Wednesday that the firm’s place in the UK would be untenable in the event of a hard Brexit.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warned that Tory infighting over the nature of the UK’s departure from the European Union was putting jobs and investment at risk.“They cannot continue to spar with each other and play ideological games whilst British jobs and industries are being pushed off the edge of a cliff,” she said.The cabinet is due to meet at Chequers on Friday in an effort to thrash out disagreements among ministers about the right Brexit plan to pursue.Just 24 hours before the summit, representatives of German firms employing 400,000 people in the UK joined JLR in issuing a dire warning about the impact of ongoing uncertainty. GIUK, whose members also include the train and bus operator Arriva – owned by the Germany’s state-owned rail company – and the steel producer ThyssenKrupp, said it needed “certainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later”.Bernd Atenstaedt, the chairman and chief executive of GIUK, said: “There is some reluctance from German business to invest in the UK with projects on hold because of the uncertainty about the future and with only nine months left before the UK leaves the EU, time is running out.”GIUK said German business would like continued free access without tariff and non-tariff barriers – such as customs checks – for exports to the UK, plus continued free access to the EU for exports from the UK. The UK is one of Germany’s most important export markets.Atenstaedt told the  that many GIUK members would not go as far as aerospace giant Airbus, which has threatened to cut back their operations in the UK in the event of a hard Brexit.JLR, the UK’s largest automotive business, this week became the latest manufacturing powerhouse to say it could be forced to withdraw investment from Britain in the event of a hard Brexit.The warning sparked renewed criticism of the government’s attitude to industry, just days after foreign secretary Boris Johnson was reported to have said “Fuck business” when asked about employers’ Brexit concerns.Cable said: “I got to know Ralf Speth well enough to know that he’s not bluffing when he says JLR’s position is a hard Brexit would make the company’s position in the UK untenable. “The Conservatives should listen. But there’s no evidence that they are willing to treat major employers with anything other than complete contempt.” Conservative MP Owen Paterson attracted criticism after brushing off JLR’s concerns in an appearance on the Radio 4 Today programme, claiming the company would be in a “wonderful position” and could buy car parts more cheaply.Labour MP Alison McGovern, whose Wirral South constituency includes Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port plant, said Paterson did not understand the automotive industry, particularly its use of “just-in-time” supply chains that require precision timing.“It is quite stunning that Owen Paterson thinks himself better placed to comment on Jaguar Land Rover’s future than their own CEO. “Perhaps even more striking is his obvious total ignorance of the just-in-time supply chains which make the car industry profitable, and the fact that it is not tariffs, but non-tariff barriers which would be the major obstacle to manufacturers in a no-deal Brexit. “People in manufacturing towns across Merseyside, the North and the Midlands know all too well what it feels like when Tories show they just don’t care about our communities and our families’ livelihoods, and they will not stand for it.”A senior figure at one manufacturing trade body with strong ties to the automotive sector said: “I don’t think we’d dignify Owen Paterson’s remarks with a response because they’re not worth anything.”Maria Eagle, whose Garston and Halewood constituency includes JLR’s Halewood plant, said the company was rightly concerned about the “appalling effects of the extreme Tory hard Brexit supported by half the cabinet and a hardline cabal of Brexit extremists”.“It’s about time this appalling government put the interests of the people of this country above their own manoeuvring to stay in office. Otherwise, our manufacturing industry faces total destruction.”Manufacturers’ trade body the EEF said: “This is not just an issue for big companies, however, but those SMEs who are also heavily exposed in the major supply chains and, as yet, are unable to know what scenario they are planning for. Time is now running out to secure the frictionless and tariff-free relationship we need with the EU if there are not to be serious consequences right across UK industry.”Its chief executive Paul Sheerin said the organisation was worried about “a deeply concerning stance to business coming from parts of the UK government”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a1573f2fce3e8e4f4915259de912b2a83035eb/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f00fae664d1cdfe17def56d8b21760","title":"how would a no deal or hard brexit affect jaguar land rover","story":"Disruption caused by tariff and non-tariff barriers could cost the car industry £7.5bn a yearJaguar Land Rover (JLR) has said a bad Brexit deal would cost the company more than £1.2bn in annual profit. How is that possible?The car industry makes better use of the free and frictionless trade offered by Europe’s single market than almost any other sector: every car that rolls off the production line in a UK plant is made up of tens of thousands of parts that between them will have made hundreds of thousands of movements across the continent.The leather chemicals and dyes used in making the seat trim sets for Jaguars and Land Rovers are sourced in Germany and Italy and imported to Scotland, where they are used to tan UK rawhides. The hides are then shipped to Poland, where they are cut and sewn into seat sets before being delivered – at the exact moment they are needed – to a UK JLR plant.Similarly, a seat frame starts with German steel being pressed into sub parts in the Czech Republic. Those parts are then painted and welded into a seat frame in the UK, assembled, and finally re-exported for fitting into a vehicle at the company’s new facility in Nitra, Slovakia. Ian Henry, an automative industry analyst, puts the total possible cost of post-Brexit tariffs for the UK car industry at up to £3bn a year – of which JLR, which makes one in three cars exported from the UK, would bear roughly a third. In any case, increased tariff barriers would not be the main impact of a bad Brexit deal. The biggest costs of doing business across borders tend to come from non-tariff barriers: rules-of-origin checks customs controls compliance with different different product standards and regulations between countries.These barriers do not exist as long as Britain is in the EU, and in order to remove them trade partners must agree on rules and regulations both can accept. The car industry has warned that as a minimum, it needs Britain to remain in the customs union with a deal that “maintains the benefits of the single market”.Critically, any post-Brexit delays at UK and continental ports would also spell the end of just-in-time delivery, requiring major investment in labour and warehousing to stock all the goods that might arrive over a longer timeframe. Honda stores enough parts to keep its Honda Civic plant in Swindon going for 36 hours and would need a warehouse the size of 42 football pitches to last just nine days.JLR’s Solihull plant makes 1,500 cars a day using 15m components any delay to parts delivery would cost it £1.25m an hour if it had to suspend production. Henry reckons the total cost of post-Brexit non-tariff barriers to the UK car industry could range from £1.5bn to £4.5bn a year – of which, again, JLR would bear about one-third.“Short term, the impact of a bad Brexit deal will be a short-term loss of sales – UK-made cars will be less competitive and prices will rise,” he said. “Longer term, there will be de-industrialisation. Not overnight, but it will happen.” The car industry is one of the UK’s leading employers, responsible for 856,000 jobs – 186,000 of them on production lines. Frictionless borders could only be achieved through continued membership of the customs union. This would, however, limit the freedom Britain would have to negotiate other trade deals independently of the EU.

Such a move might address the concerns voiced by carmakers over tariff and non-tariff barriers.But (the magazine claims), this could make it harder for Britain to strike a new trade deal with America.Brexiteers are taking this as Theresa May effectively ruling out a post-Brexit trade deal with the US just days before the US President arrives in this country.However, Downing Street are now denying this interpretation, saying Britain is “absolutely” still seeking a bilateral trade deal with the US after Brexit.But getting a deal that suits America could be harder, if Britain is committed to Europe’s agricultural standards, for example (the chlorinated chicken problem....)Our Politics Live blog has all the details:Away from the UK’s Brexit problems.... we have some solid economic data from America.US service sector companies have posted their strongest growth in four months, thanks to a pick-up in sales and new orders.That matches yesterday’s solid UK service sector data - which also showed growth at a four-month high.Some of Germany’s most powerful businesses have warned that Brexit uncertainty is putting them off investing in the UK.Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lufthansa, the train and bus operator Arriva and the steel producer ThyssenKrupp, said it needed “certainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later”.Bernd Atenstaedt, the chairman and chief executive of GIUK, said it was frustrating for his member businesses because they still did not know what a post-Brexit Britain would look like two years after the referendum.“There is some reluctance from German business to invest in the UK with projects on hold because of the uncertainty about the future and with only nine months left before the UK leaves the EU, time is running out,” he said.JP Morgan isn’t waiting to the British cabinet to agree what kind of Brexit it wants.According to Reuters, the investment bank has begun the process of moving staff from the City to continental Europe. A small first wave of employees will lead the way in the coming months.Here’s the story:JPMorgan Chase \u0026amp Co has asked “several dozen” employees to lead a first wave of relocations from the UK to continental Europe by early next year, as it pushes the button on plans to protect its business post-Brexit, according to a memo sent to staff on Thursday and seen by Reuters.The memo, the first Brexit-related mass communication to JPMorgan’s 16,000-strong UK workforce this year, highlights the organisational and strategic challenges facing global banks as they prepare for Britain’s exit from the European Union. It comes a day before Prime Minister Theresa May is due to host crunch talks with ministers at her country residence Chequers on how she wants to shape Britain’s future trading relationship with the soon-to-be 27-member club.Signed by Daniel Pinto, chief executive of JPMorgan’s Corporate \u0026amp Investment Bank and Mary Erdoes, chief executive of the bank’s Asset \u0026amp Wealth Management ision, the email also outlined JPMorgan’s plans to beef up its presence in several other EU cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan. Last year JP Morgan also bought an office block in Dublin, which could help it reshape its operations after Brexit.Theresa May’s spokesman insists the PM is listerning to British businesses about Brexit.He told reporters in Westminster:“The PM has been very clear that we take the views of business seriously and we also know the importance of providing certainty as we leave the EU,” the spokesman told reporters.We are looking forward to providing further details in the white paper.” That white paper will outline the government’s preferred customs arrangement with the EU. It should be published after tomorrow’s crunch cabinet meeting at the PM’s country residence, Chequers.May isn’t short of views from British businesses either.Jaguar Land Rover is only the latest in a string of firms to go public with their concerns. Other anxious groups include:Former business minister and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has weighed in on Jaguar Land Rover.He says JLR isn’t messing about and urges the Conservatives to treat business with more respect. “When I was in government I worked very closely with Jaguar Land Rover. It took some considerable effort to get JLR committed to the UK. “I got to know Ralf Speth well enough to know that he’s not bluffing when he says JLR’s position is a hard Brexit would make the company’s position in the UK untenable.“The Conservatives should listen. But there’s no evidence that they are willing to treat major employers with anything other than complete contempt.” Jim Pickard of the FT has heard that Speth is feeling more and more “distressed” about the impact Brexit will have on his company.Ouch. Labour MP Alison McGovern has roasted Owen Paterson for his claim that a hard Brexit would be good for JLR. McGovern points out that tariffs aren’t the only worry. Non-tariff barriers (such as ‘rules of origin’ restrictions, or time-consuming border checks) could hit sales and gum up supply chains. “It is quite stunning that Owen Paterson thinks himself better placed to comment on Jaguar Land Rover’s future than their own CEO. Perhaps even more striking is his obvious total ignorance of the just-in-time supply chains which make the car industry profitable, and the fact that it is not tariffs, but non-tariff barriers which would be the major obstacle to manufacturers in a no-deal Brexit.People in manufacturing towns across Merseyside, the North and the Midlands know all too well what it feels like when Tories show they just don’t care about our communities and our families’ livelihoods, and they will not stand for it. To protect jobs in the manufacturing industry, the only feasible solution is to stay in the Single Market and the Customs Union.”McGovern’s Wirral South constituency includes the Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port, and is also close to JLR’s Halewood plant.Labour MP Jack Dromey fears that jobs could be lost at Jaguar Land Rover’s Castle Bromwich plant, in his Birmingham Erdington constituency.Dromey says there is “profound and growing concern” about the impact of Brexit on Erdington, and the wider UK economy.He points out that manufacturers rely on seamless movement of parts to and from Europe, which would be threatened by non-tariff barriers in a hard Brexit. The nature of the automotive industry and ‘just in time’ arrangements mean that without frictionless trade with our closest trading partners, businesses cannot function and trade properly. Thousands of lorries go backwards and forwards every week to and from the continent.Dromey adds that JLR adds billions of value to the UK economy each year, and is a vital employer.We cannot allow the will of the hard-right Brexiteers to drive the UK down a deeply damaging road which would be disastrous for British business and British workers. “In one of the poorest constituencies in the country, the Jaguar plant has transformed the lives of thousands of workers. It would be tragic to see those opportunities snatched away from the thousands still out of work.” Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is urging ministers to heed JLR’s concerns about a hard Brexit.Phipson points out that jobs are also at risk at the many small companies who supply parts to the company.“This clearly underlines the reality being faced by the manufacturing sector. This is not just an issue for big companies, however, but those SMEs who are also heavily exposed in the major supply chains and, as yet, are unable to know what scenario they are planning for.Time is now running out to secure the frictionless and tariff free relationship we need with the EU if there are not to be serious consequences right across UK industry.”Labour MP Maria Eagle fears that Jaguar Land Rover’s Halewood car plant, in her Garston and Halewood constituency, is at risk from a hard Brexit. “Such a move would mean the end of JLR’s Halewood plant, the end of car manufacturing in South Liverpool and the needless destruction of thousands of the best private sector jobs in Liverpool.”“I am shocked but not surprised at this stark yet realistic warning from JLR chief executive Prof Ralph Speth about the appalling effects of the extreme Tory hard Brexit supported by half the Cabinet \u0026amp a hardline cabal of Brexit extremists”Nissan, which employs around 7,000 people at its Sunderland car plant, says:“Nissan continues to work with the UK government to ensure the company’s long-term success and investment in the UK”Getting back to Jaguar Land Rover.... and Owen Paterson’s claim that Brexit is a super opportunity for carmakers is getting short shrift:It’s official: An England World Cup win would be good for the economy, according to the Bank of England governor.This chart from Mark Carney’s speech shows just how damaging the Bank believes a trade war could be:Mark Carney appears to be getting into the World Cup spirit:Mark Carney has also used his speech in Newcastle to warn on America’s trade tariffs. Richard Partington reports:Donald Trump has received yet another warning over the threat to the global economy from his mounting trade disputes around the world - this time from the governor of the Bank of England.Speaking in Newcastle, Mark Carney said the president’s growing use of trade tariffs were already having an effect on the world economy by causing a slowdown in exports and for manufacturing.Investors reaction immediately, reading the comments as the latest signal from the Bank that interest rates will rise in August.Speaking at the Northern Powerhouse Business Summit, he said:  Domestically, the incoming data have given me greater confidence that the softness of UK activity in the first quarter was largely due to the weather, not the economic climate.Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said Jaguar Land Rover’s Brexit warning should be ringing alarm bells for Theresa May.This stark warning from one of the jewels in the crown of British automotive manufacturing should be a klaxon call to Theresa May and her cabinet. They cannot continue to spar with each other and play ideological games whilst British jobs and industries are being pushed off the edge of a cliff.Uncertainty is already hurting investment and if the Government cannot provide urgent assurances to business on negotiating a deal that secures frictionless trade with the EU, our biggest export market, 40,000 jobs at Jaguar Land Rover and countless supply chain businesses could be lost in the blink of an eye, devastating our world leading automotive sector along with the communities that support them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fe4fd95f3f10f5477e1529ba31d7833a9dd707/0_192_5022_3013/master/5022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a229f2ab900b04d4d612d72164168506","title":"is bezos holding seattle hostage the cost of being amazons home","story":"Amazon is looking for a home for its second headquarters. But in its current home, critics say rising house prices and growing inequality have damaged the cityImage shows Seattle from 2015 to 2017by  Chris McGreal in SeattleHowever they see Amazon, for good or ill, residents of the fastest-growing city in the US largely agree on the price Seattle has paid to be the home of the megacorporation: surging rents, homelessness, traffic-clogged streets, overburdened public transport, an influx of young men in polo shirts and a creeping uniformity rubbing against the city’s counterculture.But the issue of Jeff Bezos’s balls is far from settled. “Have you seen the Bezos balls?” asked Dave Christie, a jewellery maker at a waterfront market who makes no secret of his personal dislike for the man who founded and still runs Amazon. “No one wanted them. They’ve disfigured downtown. Giant balls say everything about the man. Bezos is holding Seattle hostage.”It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. “They are absolutely gorgeous. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them. Seattle has changed a lot. My rent’s gone from $500 to $1,000, but outside of that Amazon have been beneficial. It’s give and take, and anyway we invited them here.”But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing.The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub.Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place. The city gave no tax breaks and passed no anti-union laws, although the fact that Washington state law bars income tax was certainly appealing. The council did encourage the firm’s massive growth, however, with accommodations on building regulations that helped drive $4bn in construction.John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street.Amazon has sought to improve its standing with financial support for organisations such as Mary’s Place to build a new shelter for 200 homeless women and families. It is a similar story as schools and public transportation grapple to keep up with the rapidly rising population and the demographic shift it is causing.  But still the flow of cars to the Amazon campus has led to long traffic jams to the interstate. The bus route to the same area, the No 8, is notorious as one of the most overcrowded and delayed in the city, prompting a derisory Twitter account with the slogan “You can’t say late without 8!”.In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country.“As a result we’re leaving millions of dollars on the table that should be going into public investments in our state and in our city. We’re increasing taxes on the people who can least afford to pay taxes and we’re letting the affluent off the hook.”This is not how large numbers of people in Seattle think things should work. They argue that Amazon should contribute to upgrading a transport system that’s struggling under the influx it created, and improving schools that provide the educated workforce the company benefits from. “It is sort of a bipolar relationship because we do have a progressive city in some respects, we have a progressive city council in some respects, and then we have an environment that embraces inidual wealth,” said Burbank.“So if it has to do with personal freedom, that’s OK. But if it has to do with actually trying to create a shared quality of life which entails taxation of the affluent or higher taxation, that’s not OK. And so this is a really good city for him because we have a lot of personal freedom and we have no taxation. Of course chickens are going to come home to roost at some point.” Bezos’s company has arguably done much to erode the liberal and progressive culture of the city that first attracted him. Unlike other locally based giant corporations such as Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing, Amazon planted itself in the heart of the city, and the influx of well-paid tech workers has changed the feel of Seattle. Keenan-Lai sees it in the erosion of the identity of her old neighbourhood on the city’s Capitol Hill and the disappearance of older, quirky restaurants, driven out by newer, more polished places. “I can’t begrudge people moving to try to find opportunity,” she said. “But I do hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t want those programmers coming to Seattle’. It does create a lot of tension. Amazon represents both innovation and progress, and also dystopian fears for a lot of folks.” Reed, at the market stall, added: “It’s definitely weird when you go into a e bar that used to have bike gangs and now everyone’s in a polo shirt.”The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Keenan-Lai said 100,000 people – then quarter of the working population of the city – benefited from the measure, but that its impact was swiftly eroded. “The increase in the cost of housing has exceeded the increase in wages,” she said. “When we were advocating for $15 an hour the idea was that everyone who lived in Seattle could afford to live here. Our housing market just skyrocketed.”Seattle, forced by the lack of an income tax to hunt for innovative means of raising revenue, has run into resistance from Amazon at every turn. The friction peaked over the recent worker tax, which was expected to raise around $50m a year to help pay for affordable housing and services for people made homeless by escalating rents and property prices. Amazon, however, in actions critics called blackmail, characterised it as a “jobs tax”, threatened to freeze construction in the city and backed a petition drive to put the issue to a popular vote in November.The city’s chamber of commerce and other businesses threw their weight behind the ballot initiative. Popular support for the measure collapsed amid accusations that it would cost jobs and that the money would not be put to good use because the council lacks a coherent strategy to cope with the homeless crisis. Under pressure from Amazon, the council broke, and only two of the city’s nine councillors voted to keep the tax. One of them, Kshama Sawant, a member of Socialist Alternative, accused the council of a “cowardly betrayal” and called Bezos “our enemy”.Sawant, a driving force behind the $15 minimum wage, said it would be a mistake to expect Amazon to behave any differently. The company, she said, could easily afford the tax but opposed it for ideological reasons.“It’s not a tax on jobs,” she said. “It is not a tax on employees. It’s a tax on big business.

The company declined to comment for this article.Critics are not persuaded. Some see the company as attempting to shape a future in which Seattle’s residents are dependent on Amazon’s largesse through the funding of NGOs to deal with social issues, giving the company undue power at the expense of democratic institutions. “Amazon is very much, ‘We want to save the world too, let’s do it together.’ And then as you get into the details, not so much,” said Keenan-Lai. “There is a lot of benefit we provide to Amazon but the city has had a really hard time extracting benefit from the company in return.” Still, Keenan-Lai said the city’s history of progressive struggle is deep-rooted. “There’s been a long understanding that corporations can’t continue doing what they’re doing,” she said. “In Seattle, we’ve been fighting back for a long time.”This week  Cities takes a deeper look at the relationship between tech and US cities, asking whether tax giveaways are worth the cost.

Posing concerns in terms of economic stability, public health and safety, the abandoned homes that line many of the city’s streets are at once symbols of its resilience and ongoing obstacles to growth and prosperity.Cleveland native Christopher Maurer, founder and principal architect at local humanitarian design firm Redhouse Studio and adjunct professor at Kent State University, has plenty of ideas about how to address the city’s complex challenges. Inspired by the work of inventor Philip Ross and his company MycoWorks, Maurer argues that one of the keys to addressing Cleveland’s housing crisis lies in an unlikely source: mushrooms. Specifically, in using mycelium – the vegetative part of a fungus – and Cleveland’s other “natural” resource, construction waste, in a process called “biocycling”, which essentially recycles old buildings into new ones using plant materials.“I like to refer to Cleveland as ‘ground zero’ for biocycling,” says Maurer, who believes the city has the perfect conditions and challenges to serve as a prototype for the process.Widespread demolition is often touted as a means of solving many of Cleveland’s ills, including violent crime rates. In 2017, in response to the discovery of the body of a 14-year-old girl, Alianna DeFreeze, in a vacant home in Cuyahoga County after she was abducted on her way to school, the mayor, Frank Jackson, unveiled a demolition programme as part of his Healthy Neighborhoods initiative. The city allocated $5m last year for the demolition of 500 vacant homes –primarily on Cleveland’s east side – within 500ft of public schools. Given the complex obstacles Cleveland faces in the housing market, using mushrooms to rebuild may seem strange, but it’s actually part of a growing trend called mycotecture, or architecture using mushrooms and fungi. “Demolition waste is one of Cleveland’s raw materials,” Maurer says, “and the philosophy of biocycling is about doing something with what we already have rather than generating even more waste.” About 9,000 homes have been demolished in Cleveland in the last 12 years, and building with mycelium-based materials and other living organisms, he says, could serve as a viable way to make good use of the aftermath. Biocycling combines construction waste and debris with “biobinders” (natural glue or cement) like fungi, plant materials and microbes to create new building materials. In practice this means that onsite construction waste such as wood and insulation is ground up into a pulp and mixed with plant materials, which are allowed to grow in place. The resulting “bioterials” are then pressed and treated to make suitable bricks and insulation. “The ultimate goal,” says Maurer, “is to reduce the embodied carbon footprint, to be able to make new buildings entirely out of old ones.”Redhouse Studio is working on a project in Cleveland’s bustling Ohio City neighbourhood that will serve as a prototype of biocycling and showcase the possibilities of sustainable architecture. Maurer and his team are currently renovating a three-storey 19th-century building on West 25th Street to create a boutique hotel. The debris from the hotel will then be “recycled” onsite and combined with organic materials like mycelium to construct the building blocks for a shed at a nearby urban farm.Moreover, Maurer says, mushrooms can be used as a tool in mycoremediation, the use of fungi to degrade and sequester pollutants. Mycologists use mycoremediation to clean up waste sites and contaminated waterways. Because mushrooms can absorb contaminants and toxins such as lead , runs the argument, they’re ideal for converting construction waste to useful building materials. Mycoremediation is particularly relevant for cities like Cleveland, where children are exposed to lead at around four times the national average and the city’s air quality is ninth worst in the nation, according to a report from the American Lung Association.The detoxifying properties of mushrooms are also one of the reasons that biocycling “could be especially useful in disaster areas or crisis situations”, says Maurer, and could be used to build sustainable bioshelters for populations displaced by natural disasters – a crucial intervention given that in the US, climate-related disasters killed at least 362 people and cost $306bn in 2017. Maurer and his team believe the benefits of biocycling in Cleveland could serve as a model for other cities, depending on the climate, the organic materials on hand, and specific local needs. Still, the effort to make biocycling a scaleable and profitable venture is a daunting one. Some of the barriers to overcome along the way include potential pushback from material manufacturers, as well as scepticism and a possible lack of acceptance in the building industry and from the public.Proving that biocycling is both safe and sustainable – and thus bringing buildings built with these new materials up to code – will take time, funding, education and long-term testing. And, adds Maurer, when it comes to biocycling, his team are asking a lot: namely, a paradigm shift in how people view construction materials. “This work is hard,” admits Maurer. “We’re asking our collaborators to be farmers, architects, engineers, and biologists, and we’re asking microorganisms to help us build. It’s difficult to get the organisms to grow the way you want. They don’t always do what they’re told.” Even so, he’s confident that with more time and practice, “we will continue to develop symbiosis with our little friends” in order to find more innovative ways to build sustainably.Indeed, mycelium could soon be used to build sustainable technology, which Redhouse is currently discussing with MIT and the University of Akron, and even structures on the moon, about which Maurer says he’s currently in conversation with Nasa.“So – Cleveland, then the moon,” Maurer laughs. “But first, we’re focusing on Cleveland.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc0e554d134a5a4821b03e689b0f3fecc6193641/3_302_5135_3081/master/5135.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e665e9c02fc65b04792edc08375d7ec","title":"dolls dresses no proof not girl pink v blue","story":"Pink v blue gender definitions are hardening, and it’s doing everyone a disserviceAs an adolescent, I was terrified of becoming a woman. In part this was because I believed the gender stereotypes. Being a woman, I thought, meant wearing makeup and high heels men expecting things from me that I in no way wanted to give them. Being a woman seemed limiting and terrifying, and definitely not me. So as soon as I started to go through puberty, I starved myself until I looked safely asexual and boyish again. That was my solution, in 1992, to avoiding being a woman.I thought about that period of my life this week when I read an interview in the Daily Mirror with a transgender teenager who was born female. At the age of six, he told his mother he wanted to climb trees with boys. “Don’t do that, it’s not what girls do,” his mother replied. According to the report, the six-year-old replied, “Well, I’ll have a sex-change then.”“I never fitted in with the girls at school. I didn’t like makeup, or dresses, and I never wanted to shave my legs or armpits, like everyone else. I really wanted to do all the things boys did, and wear masculine clothes. I think even that young, deep down, I knew I wanted to be a man,” he told the Mirror.Whether somebody really decided to change sex because of climbing trees and makeup or, as is far more likely, this was oversimplified reporting on the Mirror’s part, nowhere in the article is there any suggestion that an aversion to feminine clothing doesn’t prove you’re a man. This interview was strikingly reminiscent of an interview on BBC Radio 4’s iPM programme, aired in 2016, in which a mother said she realised her three-year-old daughter wasn’t really a girl because she played with Wolverine toys instead of baby dolls. The interviewer did not challenge her. CBBC screened a documentary in the same year, I Am Leo, about a trans boy, in which transgenderism was explained with the help of pink brains for girls and blue brains for boys.What kind of message is this sending to girls: that if they don’t like dolls, or pink, they are literally in the wrong body? It’s hard to see how it helps anyone – least of all transgender people – for the media to reduce transgenderism to feelings about makeup, and the female experience to femininity.I once thought that definitions of gender would keep expanding until the idea of gender itself was rendered irrelevant but, to my astonishment, they have shrunk and hardened, and this has had an effect on how men and women see each other and themselves. In Nanette, her excellent new standup show on Netflix, the comedian Hannah Gadsby talks about her weariness with being told by members of the public that she must be a trans man in denial, because she is a lesbian who wears trousers. Because that’s where some of the current gender debates have led us: to women being told that they’re not really women if they don’t enjoy wearing pretty dresses.Far from gender being “on a spectrum”, as the current lingo has it, too many well-meaning articles about it are more binary than ever: girls are like this, boys are like that. This is what feminists like me object to because gender is restrictive and femininity in particular was conceived to be limiting. News that 40 British schools have banned skirts in favour of trousers, in a hamfisted attempt at gender neutrality, is merely a different side to the same coin, because the message being sent to children is, “Skirts are too dangerously feminine to be worn by boys.”For me, not eating was at least in part an expression of anxiety about femininity and sexuality, represented by my changing body. This is extremely common among teenage girls, who then find ways to punish the bodies that are taking them into womanhood, whether they like it or not, and it is getting even more so.There is no single cure for unhappy girls, but as adults it is up to us to teach our children that one does not need to change one’s body to reject socially imposed gender stereotypes. Girls can swing from the trees like monkeys and plait their own leg hair they can play with tea sets and measure their life in lipsticks or they can do all of the above simultaneously, if they so please, and none of this has anything to do with their bodies, biology or brain colour. Biological sex goes deeper than leg hair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c761d319dc5554a1562635db5de89ef1800c5873/0_45_3568_2141/master/3568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337a0963d46ced3d41fac20322f06404","title":"esther mcvey lies work pensions universal credit","story":"The work and pensions secretary’s fabrications about universal credit are worse than the actions that led Amber Rudd to resign• McVey apologises for misleading MPs on welfare changesIn a world of fake news and downright mendacity, lying to parliament may seem like just another day in politics. But the work and pensions secretary Esther McVey’s non-apology in the Commons on Wednesday, deliberately repeating fabrications about the universal credit (UC) disaster, takes indifference to facts to a new level of insolence.The comptroller and auditor general, Sir Amyas Morse, who is in charge of the rigorously independent National Audit Office, has a reputation for strict propriety and extreme circumspection in his public comments. It takes unprecedented misrepresentation of an NAO report to force him to take the extraordinary step of publishing his letter of reprimand to the minister in charge of the Department for Work and Pensions. What else can he do when this minister has the effrontery to refuse to meet him? She plainly takes a Trumpist approach to inconvenient realities, so why bother meeting this annoying nitpicker?Even more impudent was her claim that his report was based on outdated statistics: he spells out how carefully figures were squared with DWP officials right up to publication. All this matters critically to millions of low-paid families on the brutal sharp end of UC.Cavalier trashing of the NAO, our sacred keeper of the flame of facts, evidence and honest auditing, is profoundly alarming. This government, engaged in monumentally perilous Brexit negotiations, needs now more than ever to engage with difficult truths without flinching from inconvenient realities.But instead McVeyism is everywhere. Duncan Smith, the architect of UC and many other calamities in one of the most disaster-causing political careers of our time, had the gall to tell parliament that Morse’s report is “a shoddy piece of work”. As he appears on our screens day after day propounding preposterous Brexit unrealities, broadcasters should ask if there comes a point when a politician found responsible for an act of such monumental failure is stripped of all public credibility? As for McVey, her deliberate misleading of parliament is considerably worse than the actions that led to Amber Rudd’s resignation as home secretary earlier this year after she inadvertently misled the home affairs select committee. But there is no sign of any such honourable resignation from McVey."},{"url":null,"title":"mp degrading voting experience proxy democracy","story":"The archaic proxy voting system strips the sick of their dignity and fails to serve democracy. It must be reformed• Naz Shah is MP for Bradford WestYesterday marked two weeks since the day my appearance in parliament to cast my vote – in a wheelchair, with my sick bucket in my lap, on morphine – caused upset across the political ide and further.I’m still struggling with nerve pain, which has worsened over the last few years. However, it is what it is, and there’s not a lot I can do. However, I can handle that because I’m in the hands of a brilliant pain specialist team in my local hospital, for which I am utterly grateful. But nobody should be expected to handle what I had to that day.Andrea Leadsom can try to hide behind a cloak of bureaucracy, but the reality is that I was lying on a sofa less than 50 yards behind the Speaker’s chair in the ladies members’ room for the three-hour debate. I was taking liquid morphine to manage my pain, aggravated by the four hours I spent lying in the back of my office manager’s car, who kindly drove me to London that morning. I endured this despite being told that I would be “nodded through”, as is customary when people are very unwell, although they have to be seen in the grounds of the estate by whips from both sides to confirm their voting intention. The Tory whips had three hours to agree to nod me through. It takes a simple conversation. It’s not rocket science.Last Thursday, I ventured out to the Bradford literature festival opening dinner. Out of kindness and goodness, people asked after my health. Many expressed their shock, having seen what I was put through. I did my best to find the humour in it, finding myself repeating to people, “Hey, only I could pull off going to vote in my PJs”, but the truth is that it was degrading, humiliating and downright horrible. It should never have happened. The experience of having to take my sister’s hijab, and put it over myself to give me some coverage and dignity, while being forced into such an undignified position epitomises it. I wasn’t expecting to have to “attend work” among my 650 colleagues, or to appear on national television and splashed across newspapers for having to vote like that.The fact that Laura Pidcock said she felt she had to prove she was pregnant, that Jo Swinson was voting two days past her due date is shameful. It is not something you should have to do in any job, yet to do it in a place that sets the laws, a place that is supposed to set the standard for the whole country is depressing. It is reflective of a system that remains male dominated, and a legacy of class politics.As MPs, it is hard to explain the expectation and pressure, but also the absolute desire, to want to be able to represent our constituents. Even more so for votes like the one two weeks ago, which could be defining for a generation. It is an immense privilege to be in this position, a responsibility we don’t take lightly.Today parliament will debate proxy voting, largely focused on MPs who have just had children. However, it could also set a precedent about how we deal with voting in the future. It cannot be right that our constituents are unable to be represented if we fall ill at an inconvenient time. We cannot allow physical presence to be the only determining factor when it comes to who can vote on such important matters.With some votes, many members could have campaigned for years about specific issues and then be unable to attend when it matters because of circumstances that prevent them from being in parliament in person. Surely, when even basic compassion and dignity are denied to me and others, we have to ask ourselves if there is a better way.It would be fairer to answer these difficult questions now than to allow a perverse, archaic practice to continue where people like myself are stripped of their dignity just so they can represent the people who elected them.• Naz Shah is Labour MP for Bradford West"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b32940c05506df5cdfcabb50cfda808b795355e/0_43_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c970a01713de433cdc13fbb8a5fbe444","title":"vote leave democracy electoral commission","story":"Electoral laws must be updated to give police and the Electoral Commission real powers to enforce our voting rulesOn Tuesday evening, the nation held its collective breath as the English football team beat Colombia on penalties to make it to the quarter-final of the world cup. Meanwhile, Vote Leave leaked news that the Electoral Commission is set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.This is not the most obvious example of news being buried in Westminster. But it could be one of the most significant. With Britain just months from falling off a Brexit cliff edge, and with no guarantee yet in place for a people’s poll on the final deal, the disastrous consequences of failing to meet fundamental standards of democracy will be felt for generations to come.Vote Leave chose to release details of the allegations it’s trying to defend itself against before the Electoral Commission could present its findings. Presumably they wanted to take back control of the story. We now know the Electoral Commission has accused Vote Leave of breaching its official spending limit of £7m by channelling donations to a smaller campaign, BeLeave, with which it was allegedly coordinating. If Vote Leave cheated, we as voters deserve to know the full facts, and while Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project may well be right that it’s unlikely any court will deem the outcome of the referendum void, that doesn’t mean Vote Leave should get off scot free.It is vital that the police be given the power to investigate and prosecute electoral offences. At the moment these powers are held by the Electoral Commission, but are effectively rendered toothless by a £20,000 limit on the fines that can be imposed for wrongdoing. If there is evidence they broke the law, Vote Leave’s directors should face criminal charges. But we also need unlimited fines and police action, backed and informed by the Electoral Commission as a regulatory body, if we want to deter cheating in future elections and referendums.This isn’t about whether you voted leave or remain – it’s about the very foundations of our democracy. And we must learn from this episode if we are to safeguard that democracy in the future. The Vote Leave revelations underscore the clear need for stricter controls on campaign spending. As a starting point, spending should be published online much more quickly than at present and with separate and stricter reporting requirements for social media platforms such as Facebook, so it is easier to track and easy to access.A ban on central campaigns gifting money to smaller ones would have prevented Vote Leave from giving BeLeave over £600,000 in the final weeks of the referendum, which the Electoral Commission says breached Vote Leave’s official spending limit of £7m.Our electoral laws need to keep pace with the digital change driving elections too. Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 71 million Facebook users, including 1 million Britons. We know that information about relationships, political beliefs, interests and hobbies can be used to influence how people vote. Cambridge Analytica may be closing its doors, but it would be an act of great naivety to think the company’s practices will die with it. Just one-quarter of people in Britain trust news on social media, and is it any wonder?The digital world is finding its way into ever greater areas of our lives, and the internet has the potential to be the most democratic space in society, if we work hard to secure that. A new digital bill of rights for democracy, as championed by Fair Vote, could take on surveillance capitalism and establish the UK as the leading voice on standards for the rule of law and democracy in digital spaces, including by creating an independent regulatory body for social media platforms. And we should be urgently seeking cross-party agreement on legislation to regulate digital campaigning in future elections.

I have been a fan of the waistcoat for more than 20 years now, ever since a trip to Nepal, when I saw a dazzling array of waistcoats and decided I had to have one. They’re very popular on the subcontinent – and as apparently the garment’s origins are from round the corner, in Persia, this is somehow fitting.Which is what waistcoats do very well. It’s quite clever how they do this, considering that they’re meant to be tight around the torso. But they are forgiving because – and here’s the clever bit – you can either have them done up, or undone.The tradition of leaving the bottom button undone is said to have been started in emulation of Edward VII, who was too fat to do them all up. The England manager, Gareth Southgate, doesn’t do this, and this is important, because the waistcoat has an astonishing ability to both underline and erase class distinctions.The garment may belong to the three-piece suits of the elite, and the fancy uniforms of Etonians (that ultra-smarmy set within a set of Etonians known as “Pop” are allowed considerable latitude in the design of their waistcoats, and they strut like peacocks in them), but they also belong to the working class, to snooker players, honky-tonk piano players, and cowboys. Just as they operate in a liminal space between the shirt and the jacket, so they exist in an ambivalent place between classes. (Yes, I know this will get me into Pseuds Corner in Private Eye, but it doesn’t mean what I have said is actually untrue.)Wearing a waistcoat without a jacket is, of course, the best way to wear one. It signifies that one is at work, but also that one is ready to roll up one’s sleeves to get that work done. It frames the body nicely, and is probably the only item of male clothing that objectifies the body in such a way as to make it alluring. (Of course, this depends on the body, but still.) And even better, it has pockets. All the pockets a jacket has, but without the sleeves, which get grubby, wrinkled, frayed. A waistcoat, well looked after, will see the rest of its suit – if it came with a suit – to the grave.My own waistcoat, brought back by a girlfriend from a trip to Nepal (after she’d asked me if I wanted anything from there) didn’t come from a suit. It is my single most indispensable item of clothing, and not just because of the person who gave it to me. And now that Southgate has brought them into the limelight, my foresight and excellent taste have been vindicated.

No movie accent will ever give me as much joy as Cruise’s Irish accent.Not a disaster, but nowhere near as good as a Spielberg-Cruise adaptation of HG Wells’ tale should have been. Cruise, deep into his publicly eccentric years, plays a orced dad just trying to do right by his kids while fighting alien invaders, but comes across more alien than the invaders.This film was supposed to be exciting because we kinda, sorta, maybe got to see Cruise and his then wife, Nicole Kidman, have sex, but a major flaw in that sales pitch is no one wanted to. Including, it turned out, them. Their marriage fell apart soon after the making of this film and some of us are still unconvinced it was worth the marriage.It’s Top Gun – in a car. And nowhere near as good. This film is best known as the one in which Cruise and Kidman met. But it should be celebrated for giving Cruise’s character the name of Cole Trickle. For not laughing hysterically every time they say his name, everyone in this film deserves an Oscar.No one watches this movie now. But they should. Babyfaced and clearly vertically challenged, Cruise plays the most unlikely American football player ever committed to film, but even in the early days of his career, his charisma was undeniable. Unexpectedly gritty and with lovely support from Craig T Nelson.Gosh, who should we get to play the young lawyer, full of morals and ambition, who suddenly finds himself in a bad world filled with bad men? John Grisham may not have written the part with Cruise in mind, but whichever Thetan Cruise worships made him for thismovie.Eat me, haterz: people who criticise this film have no sense of fun. Cruise is enjoyably weird as Lestat de Lioncourt, the ultimate vampire. The real problem with this movie is Brad Pitt, who takes it all way too seriously. Cruise understands this is not a drama – it’s a camp delight.Frankly, if you don’t enjoy the sight of Cruise slinging rum cocktails on a beach to a Beach Boys soundtrack, then please march yourself to a doctor immediately because you have lost your soul.Grizzled Paul Newman, rehashing his role from The Hustler, hands the matinee idol baton here to a young and twinkly-eyed Cruise. It is hard not to die a little inside when you look at Cruise’s pretty face and think of the weird life choices he would go on to make a babe heading off into the dark woods.A bit of a cheat this, yes, as Cruise is barely in the movie. But, his performance as the deranged studio executive Les Grossman was so good it saved his career after all the sofa jumping and Scientology bullshittery. Some of us have never really recovered from the sight of a bald Cruise grooving to Flo Rida.Probably not a movie that Cruise kicks back and watches in his spare time, given that his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, is now dating his co-star, Jamie Foxx. Still, that shouldn’t distract the rest of us from enjoying Cruise playing memorably against type as a killer and Foxx as the cabby he hires for the evening. It does distract a little, mind.Hear me out: Cruise should have got the Oscar for this instead of Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman’s performance is all tricks and tics, but Cruise, as the obnoxious jerk who learns he has a brother, is subtle and true. Setting the pattern for his career, Cruise was underrated because he made it look effortless.Cruise and Spielberg should, by rights, be as natural a combination as bread and butter, and yet Minority Report is the only truly satisfying movie they have made together. Playing a working-class teenager in Oklahoma alongside then fellow near-unknowns Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane and Matt Dillon (someone give that casting director a medal), Cruise his a small but pleasing role in this, the most beautiful of all 80s teen movies.Cameron Crowe wrote this role of the beaten-down sports agent for the other Tom – Hanks – and the movie probably would have made more sense with him: Cruise is just too good-looking to be a credible underdog. But, he seizes the part with irresistible intensity, making even the naffest of Crowe’s lines sound heartfelt.The film that, for better or worse, confirmed Cruise as the action star of his generation, and while that means he has churned out a lot of action landfill for the past decade, the original Mission: Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, is a stone-cold classic. Somewhere, in all of our hearts, Cruise will be forever suspended on that zip wire.It is Cruise’s misfortune that his one real shot at an Oscar – before the Scientology weirdness ruled him out for ever – coincided with the year of Daniel Day-Lewis’s unbeatable performance in My Left Foot. His performance as a Vietnam vet is the definitive retort to any fool who insists he is a movie star, not an actor.Pure cinematic pleasure. Cruise is known as a screen-chewer, but it is too rarely acknowledged how good he is at playing second fiddle to a true ham: Hoffman in Rain Man and Jack Nicholson here. “I want the truth!” is Cruise at his Cruisiest, and there ain’t nothing wrong with that.One of three performances for which Cruise should have won an Oscar. Heretofore seen as almost asexual, Cruise is astonishing as TJ Mackie, the men’s rights activist guru with the catchphrase “Respect the cock!” No one could have imagined him in this role before. It’s now impossible to imagine anyone else playing it.Risky Business made Cruise famous, but it’s a terrible movie.

Now an extraordinary array of devices promise to unlock this vital energy potentialUsing giant kites, blades and paddles, and mimicking pogo sticks, blowholes and even the human heart, groups around the world are on the cusp of harnessing the colossal power of the oceans.The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government’s rejection on Monday of a £1.3bn tidal project at Swansea. “There is no doubt – shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,” says François Renelier at Bessé, a French insurance broker.But the ocean energy sector is frothing with ideas, with hundreds of companies developing an extraordinary array of devices and backed by billions of dollars of investment. Among the serious contenders tapping rapid tidal flows are 12 metre-wide underwater kites that soar and swoop.“We fly with the tides,” says Martin Eklund, at Minesto, which is installing a £25m array off Anglesey, north Wales. “The main advantage is we can harvest energy from very low currents. This resource is abundant – it is everywhere.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,” says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU €3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade.Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world’s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in the Pentland Firth, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too.OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish.Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector. “The cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,” says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company’s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine.He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: “I ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.” Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. “That has been the big challenge for wave energy – how to turn it on and off in big storms,” says chief executive, Patrik Möller.Paddles are being deployed too, such as WaveRoller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator.The Wave Piston’s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. “We have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,” says Martin von Bülow, at the company.One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link.Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. “Clean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,” says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. “It is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week.The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. “Everyone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,” says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world.However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. “While offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,” says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella.This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. “They call it the valley of death - we’re there,” says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased.However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months.Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. “As long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,” says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro.His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 247, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far.The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. “I’m not really sure,” he says.Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: “Wake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Nutrient run-off from agriculture and urban sewage are thought to be to blame.“Dead zones” – areas of sea, typically near the bottom, with a dearth of oxygen – are caused by a rise in nutrients in the water that boosts the growth of algae. When these organisms die and sink to the seafloor, bacteria set to work decomposing them, using up oxygen in the process. The resulting lack of oxygen not only curtails habitats for creatures that live on the seafloor, but also affects fish stocks and can lead to blooms of toxic cyanobacteria.But it is not a problem confined to the Baltic. Earlier this year a study revealed that ocean dead zones have quadrupled in size since the 1950s, and are found the world over in coastal regions of high population, from Europe to North America and China. Researchers behind the latest study say that while nations are taking action to help waters rebound, iniduals can help. “In terms of the general public, one of the main things to do in the future may be to reduce the proportion of meat in the diet. Livestock agriculture generates higher nutrient losses per kilogram of food produced,” said Sami Jokinen, a PhD student at the University of Turku, and Tom Jilbert, an assistant professor of the University of Helsinki, who are co-authors of the research.At present, the Baltic Sea dead zone extends across 70,000 km2 – an area almost twice the size of Denmark. The team say the lack of oxygen in the waters at the bottom is seasonal, related to layering of the water resulting from summer heating of the surface. While previous studies have revealed that oxygen depletion has occurred in the central Baltic at various points in time in the past several thousand years, the latest study looks at how oxygen levels have changed in coastal waters.Writing in the journal Biogeosciences, the team, from Finland and Germany, describe how they probed the issue by removing two four-metre-long cores from a site between the coasts of Sweden and Finland. The team used a host of measures to analyse one of the cores, including looking at the grain sizes of the sediment layers and ratios of different types of elements. They also used both cores to hunt for trace fossil burrows from organisms that lived in the sediment. Among the findings, they found clear layers of sediment dating back to just over 100 years, suggesting that animals including bivalves and annelids disappeared from the bottom of the sea from this point.The upshot was that the researchers were able to reconstruct how oxygen levels at the seafloor have changed over the past 1,500 years, revealing that while the degree of oxygen depletion in coastal areas has varied over the period – largely due to changes in the climate – there has been a marked depletion in the past 100 years or so.The researchers say they were surprised to find that the steep drop in oxygen levels began before the postwar peak in urbanisation and intensive agriculture in the region in the 1950s. They say a combination of factors is likely to blame, including an uplift of the Baltic area as well as human activity – the latter a factor that appears to have become increasingly important.“Our evidence of deoxygenation at the beginning of the 20th century suggests that the human influence was felt earlier – in other words, that the system is more sensitive than we thought previously,” Jokinen and Jilbert told the .The pair note that since 2007, coastal nations around the Baltic Sea have attempted to improve the situation with an action plan to reduce nutrients flowing into the waters, and that oxygen levels are on the rise in waters off Stockholm. But, they add, global warming might be hindering progress, with no evidence of recovery seen in the regions examined. “It is likely delaying the recovery process, because oxygen dissolves less easily in warm water,” they said. Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.“Its great strengths are the fine-scale resolution of the timing of changes in conditions, and its ability to take us back all the way to Europe in the dark ages, long before the industrial revolution and modern population growth,” he said. “By doing so, the researchers can separate human from environmental forces shaping the Baltic, to show that Baltic dead zones are the responsibility of those who live along its shores.”But, he said, the study also raised concerns.“One troubling finding is that recent efforts to reduce pollution have not yet led to recovery,” said Roberts. “The Baltic is stuck in a vicious cycle in which low oxygen at the seabed releases nutrients trapped in bottom sediments to fuel yet more plankton bloom and bust that causes the dead zones to get bigger.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c32c19fb1e9d90d2ed87e1a143eb988d242623/195_0_5467_3282/master/5467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ba54ff596b188264f987f47dbcba86 620w","title":"jumpsuits are the unrivalled look of the summer but why are they so popular","story":"Whether a playsuit for a party, a boilersuit for everyday or culotte-style for the heatwave, the jumpsuit is the must-have outfit right now. How did they become so ubiquitous?Jane Fonda’s stylist recently called jumpsuits “the epitome of a modern woman’s wardrobe”, and they have ushered in an age in which women no longer have to spend hours agonising over matching separates. At Ascot last year, they were finally decreed fit for the races, while that weathervane of high-street fashion, Asos, gave them their own category on its site in 2016, alongside skirts, trousers and tops.But why are they suddenly so popular? Perhaps a line could be drawn between our increasingly busy lives and the sartorial ease of a one-piece.It helps that, according to  stylist Melanie Wilkinson, “there really is a style to suit everyone … overall styles will look cool and modern”, or for a more pulled-together look “opt for a belted style”. If you’re more petite “this season’s culotte-style jumpsuit is ideal to avoid trouser legs puddling on the floor”.The jumpsuit has come a long way since it was first invented in the early 20th century by the Florentine artist Thayat, who wanted to create a liberating, anti-bourgeois item of clothing. In the 60s, Mick Jagger wore an Ossie Clark one with metal rings that apparently heated up under stage lights and burned his skin. In the 70s, Farrah Fawcett wore a deep-V silky emerald green jumpsuit in Charlie’s Angels, while the 80s brought Anneka Rice’s brightly coloured tracksuit versions.Stella McCartney has long been a fan, but arguably the pioneer for today’s renaissance is former Celine designer Phoebe Philo. When the woman credited as having the most influence on our wardrobes in the past decade wore a black tux-esque jumpsuit to the British Fashion Awards in 2009, fashion circles swooned. A few years later and they were big at Cannes, worn by Kristen Stewart and Jennifer Lawrence a “red-carpet rebel” next to more traditional, goody-two-shoes gowns.The most 2018 look in the jumpsuit family tree, however, is less about red-carpet glamour and more about workwear. The jumpsuit’s hard-grafting cousin the boilersuit is having a moment. Asos has seen a rise in demand, particularly for wrap-front styles, dungarees and casual boilersuits. M.C. Overalls is one brand nailing this aesthetic. Their £135 overalls come in functional navy, baby blue or pink and are built to last. According to founder and CEO James Scroggs, their utility “resonates with people as the bridge between our personal and professional wardrobes becomes muddled”.If you’re after a more subtle nod to the workwear aesthetic, you can always fall back on trusty dungarees. On Asos you’ll find them in red, floral and off-white as well as classic blue and black denims.So if you are yet to join the jumpsuit brigade in this long, hot summer, why not jump in, feet first?I like jumpsuits because they’re more put together than shorts and a T-shirt, and more practical than a dress, but you get the same visual impression. I’m doing the London sights sightseeing today with my friend from America – when it’s windy on the river, dresses blow everywhere. I think they’re good in a heatwave because they’re quite light. The one I’m wearing today is from Hollister – and I don’t usually shop there, but I saw it in the window. It was about £30.I wear jumpsuits about four times a week – they’re an easy, quick outfit and they’re comfortable and cool in this weather. I’ve been wearing them for a couple of years, inspired by how many there are now to choose from in the shops – you can have a different one for every day of the week. This one is from a charity shop and was £6.I like jumpsuits because they’re really easy. You can literally just slip them on and you feel very comfortable. Plus they’re great in a heatwave – especially this one, because it’s so airy. Over the years I’ve owned a lot. I was a singersongwriter and they were a good stage outfit. I’ve always found them really glamorous and I really love the 80s and that kind of overall vibe with big earrings. This one is from Asos. I can’t remember how much it was but it wasn’t that expensive.Jumpsuits are comfortable and easy they’re good to walk in. I don’t remember when I first started wearing them but it was probably when I was little. I now own about seven of them. I don’t think they’re particularly good in a heatwave, they’re a little sweaty. The one I’m wearing today is from Urban Outfitters and cost about $40.Jumpsuits have always been one of my favourite things to wear – I like the androgynous style. If we were going out later on tonight I could put on heels and look glam. Now I’m wearing sandals and I look summery and casual. I can’t count how many I own – I swap them around as I fluctuate in weight. I think they’re good for a heatwave, especially if they’re not the tight leotard kind. This one is black, which is not the best colour for the heat, but it’s backless so it’s breezy. It was from Finery and cost £85.Jumpsuits are comfortable and look stylish. I’ve been wearing a lot – I think as it’s summer and they’re doing lots of nice prints. I used to have lots for going out, now I have more casual ones. This one’s from Zara and cost £25.Oh, jumpsuits are so comfortable! And they keep you covered up, but not too covered up – when it’s weather like this, they’re really cool. They’re really flattering as well – I have quite a bottom-heavy shape and I think they quite suit it. I own up to 10, all different colours, textures and style. This one is from Missguided. It was definitely less than £15.I like jumpsuits because they’re practical, long and versatile because there are lots of different styles. I have about 10 in my current repertoire, and will wear them at least once a week. They’re not figure-hugging so they don’t stick to you in this weather. Even when it’s cold I’ll wear the shorter ones with tights. This one is from Hollister, probably via Asos. It cost about £30.I love jumpsuits, I’m obsessed – they are smart and comfortable but with a slight fashion edge. I’ve been wearing them for about two years. I used to think they looked like you were trying to make a different statement, and my style is quite classic, but now they’ve come into the mainstream they feel more classic. For business travel they’re effortless. I use jersey jumpsuits for long-haul flights – an air stewardess the other day wanted to know where one was from. They’re great in the heatwave – this one’s silk, so it’s lightweight. It’s from LK Bennett and was about £200.They’re very comfortable and they go with anything. I think they’re good in a heatwave, especially this one I’m wearing because it’s sleeveless and three-quarter-length. I think I own about three or four – some floral, some spotty. This one’s from Missguided – I can’t remember exactly how much it was, but it was reasonable.I got my first playsuit when I was 20 I was always told they suited me. They’re very cool and the shorts are handy for when you’re doing activities – you’re not always worrying about gusts of wind on the underground like you are with a dress. I’ve always felt comfortable wearing them. I have to make sure my legs are a bit tanned, but that’s only the same as wearing shorts. This one is from Primark and it was about €16.Jumpsuits are nice in summer, especially in Canada where you can’t wear this kind of stuff all year round. I’ve been wearing them for a couple of years and probably have about five. I think they might have been in style when I graduated and moved to the city. I got this one online, I think it’s shipped from China but I found it on Instagram. It was about US$30.

Lanzmann was a contemporary of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre with a dashing and even rather swashbuckling profile, a magazine founder, a petition signer, a superstar attender at soirées and conferences. It all made him appear as a man of action as well as a man of contemplation: and someone whose amours arguably marked him out as steeped in the robustly male sexual politics of an era different from the present day.Born to a Jewish family in Paris, he was a veteran both of the French resistance (in which he fought as a teenager) and of opposition to the Algerian wars, and his French citizenship and impeccable record of courage and heroism in the second world war gave him the objectivity and credentials to work on his remarkable masterpiece, Shoah (1985). This was in an age when there were many Holocaust survivors still alive, with fiercely strong memories, and indeed when many culpable Nazis were still secretly at large.Shoah was a nine-and-a-half hour oral history record of the Holocaust, edited down from 350 hours of raw interview footage it had some contemporary newsreel material but was effectively based entirely on verbal recollections of people involved: breaking down into four parts, discussions of three camps: Chelmno, Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau and the Warsaw Ghetto. Lanzmann interviewed the victims, survivors and witnesses, but also some perpetrators, including an SS officer, who had only agreed to speak off camera so they couldn’t be recognised. Lanzmann used a hidden camera for these interviews, an imposture which was widely hailed as entirely justified, though Lanzmann was physically attacked at one stage when the concealed camera was discovered. Lanzmann established a procedure for talking and thinking about the Holocaust which in its honesty, integrity, rigour and good faith has never been seriously challenged or repudiated. Attempts to show the horror on camera, either in documentary form or – more difficult still – as drama, are always liable to be criticised as sentimentalising, or sensationalising, or fetishising. But the austerity of just someone speaking is very different. The emphasis is simply on what happened, though always with a sense that the whole story can never be covered. The larger sense of why – why and how German nation came to embrace such evil – is not part of the film’s remit, and in fact Lanzmann did not care to venture into this arena of thought, in case it becomes a kind of counsel for the defence. For Lanzmann, the question defined the Wittgensteinian ne plus ultra: it was that whereof we could not speak. Later, in his film The Last of the Unjust, he tackled the question of complicity, by bringing to light his unused 1970s interview footage with Austrian Jewish survivor Benjamin Murmelstein, the “chairman” of the Theresienstadt Ghetto near Prague, reviled for having negotiated with Adolf Eichmann on the subject of enforced Jewish emigration. He is treated with great generosity by Lanzmann, who emphasises the cruelty and humiliation which these “elders” endured. When I met Lanzmann at the Cannes film festival last year, it was like meeting a Buddha of the cinema: he sat and listened to my questions seated in a kind of squatting position on a sofa, his chin resting on the handle of a cane, looking away from me and gazing out to sea. It was on the occasion of his one of his last films, Napalm, about a personal story which he first told in his memoir The Patagonian Hare. As a young man, he was part of a delegation to North Korea and had a passionate romantic escapade with a beautiful North Korean nurse. I suggested to him that there may have been elements of a honeytrap in this, and he reacted with extravagant and very funny scorn, emphasising the genuine passion with which he and the young woman kissed – he actually mimed hugging and kissing – and imperiously told me: “It is probably because you read too much John le Carré that you think this. But I like your idea. It is a very British idea.”Lanzmann was a remarkable man. An open, free, all-day showing of Shoah every 27th January at the BFI Southbank for Holocaust Memorial Day would be a great way for him to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671b4be80d5d2d2b128f67abe9433f8fb22d337a/0_62_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11717bce92e3422bbcaf8f01947f114b","title":"england world cup sweden samara","story":"• Temperatures reach 36.5C in Samara• Weather similar to that in Nizhny NovgorodSamara, the venue for England’s World Cup quarter-final, has been hit by a record-breaking heatwave in recent days, and the match is likely to be played in temperatures significantly warmer than those at England’s training base outside St Petersburg.On Tuesday temperatures here reached 36.5C, breaking a temperature record for the city set in 1954 and causing problems with water pressure. By Thursday the temperature had dropped to around 30C but on Saturday afternoon, when Sweden and England will kick off at 6pm, it is still forecast to be 27-29C.The hot sunny weather will be a change for the England squad, much warmer than the chilly, drizzly evening in Moscow for the last-16 match against Colombia and a good 10C warmer than at their Repino base, where the daytime high is currently 17-18C with frequent rain. Sweden may be more acclimatised, with the team’s training base being in the sunny Black Sea resort of Gelendzhik.However, England have shown they can play in high temperatures during the tournament, brushing aside Panama 6-1 in Nizhny Novgorod in temperatures over 30C.Sweden have given themselves more time to settle in, as the squad flew here a full day before England. The Sweden squad were due to land on Thursday afternoon and spend 48 hours in Samara before the game. England are due to train in Repino on Friday morning and then fly at lunchtime.The unusually hot weather here, combined with the presence of tens of thousands of fans, has put pressure on the region’s water system, leading to low water pressure in certain parts of the city. The hotels where the England and Sweden teams will stay are unlikely to be affected but the Samara water authorities released a statement this week saying pressure was affected and calling on people to save water by taking showers in pairs.The water authority issued a further statement on Thursday, clarifying that the call had been meant as a joke, after media coverage of a potential water shortage. “We jokily suggested people should shower in pairs and we even added a smiley face to our suggestion, but some media outlets have taken it too seriously,” ran the statement. “Water supply in Samara is normal … We hope that our call improved people’s moods and was taken with humour.”A trickle of England fans began arriving in Samara on Thursday. Most flights and train tickets within 24 hours of the match have been snapped up long in advance, meaning supporters booking travel in recent days have had to resort to coach travel, car sharing or using nearby airports.Mikhail Maltsev, the region’s head of tourism, said authorities were expecting the majority of spectators at the 42,000-seat Samara Arena to be Russian, with around 3,500 England fans and 5,500 Sweden fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2dc4b9b38dd002ca38a94f3660c3d0ff7a51e5a/0_174_4043_2427/master/4043.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51901b01659da86a3138a6320b341643","title":"gareth southgate england world cup","story":"Focus, ruthless, desire, strength. These are some of the words which are the norm in the lexicon of successful football coaches and teams – assets where the head rules the heart in the pursuit of results and trophies. So much has been said and written about England since the but there is one word I’d add to Gareth Southgate’s approach which is unusual in this environment: vulnerability.Vulnerability is often viewed as a negative, especially in the competitive world of elite sport, but at times it can also be a huge strength which has the potential to maximise togetherness and team spirit. This is something so easy to see from the outside when these England players are constantly encouraging each other and admitting how much they rely on each other on and off the field.There is an obvious vulnerability in the fact it is Southgate’s first major tournament and yet he is happy to be open with the press and also to be so much closer to his players than England managers in the past. Did you see the way he embraced Harry Kane after the penalty shootout on Tuesday night?There is vulnerability in the fact the lack of seasoned experience of World Cup tournament football has been offset by youthful confidence and exuberance throughout the squad. And on a personal level there is vulnerability in the fact many of the players, including Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling, have felt comfortable enough to show their human side for the first time to the media, creating a link and bond between an England squad and the public I have never witnessed before. No matter what happens in the quarter-final against Sweden on Saturday or for the rest of this tournament no one can argue against the fact every member of this squad, management team and support staff has shown an integrity, humility, confidence and passion worthy of wearing the Three Lions shirt.The reconnection between England and everyone who loves football in this country is palpable. When Eric Dier’s penalty hit the back of the net I ran and slid on my knees across the front room, just like millions of us in that moment when Southgate’s fearless young team destroyed the mental barrier of winning a World Cup shootout.The last time I reacted so emotionally and physically to an England goal was 20 years ago at France 98 when Sol Campbell’s disqualified strike sent me from ecstasy to disappointment in a matter of seconds. The way this team have me responding in the same manner as I did as 13-year-old epitomises the fearless, confident way these players and the manager have conducted themselves and the way they have represented this country and not been afraid to be more open and communicative through the media and in turn with the public.They have set standards with a recognisable playing style and cultural identity that must be adhered to in the years to come and it is fitting it has been set by a manager who has been by far the most “inexperienced” before taking the so called “impossible” job. Southgate has impressed me so much with his calm, honest and intuitive way of dealing with everything while remaining fundamental to his strong beliefs on a playing style that has empowered and enabled John Stones, Harry Maguire and Kyle Walker to be confident in their ability to build from the back and take possession, something lacking for too long in our national team. The 3-5-2 system employed has brought rewards but the next question and obstacle this squad and Southgate in particular have to overcome is can we adapt our system if things don’t go according to plan – something we haven’t done yet?It’s happened to other teams and, for example, Belgium and Roberto Martínez had to adapt everything in their amazing encounter with Japan when they were 2-0 down. By being brave and changing from their stock 3-4-3 to a 4-3-3 they managed to come back and win the game in an almost unbelievable manner. Even Brazil made an outstanding tactical change in their game against Mexico after they struggled in the opening 30 minutes by adapting from a 4-3-3 to a more orthodox 4-4-2 to enable Neymar to play in a more central position, from where he scored, and give them more flexibility in terms of dominating the game with possession.In terms of our 3-5-2, there is huge benefit in the way we are able to construct play from the back while being able to dominate numerically in central areas of the pitch. But there were times against Colombia when we allowed them to take control of possession for long periods to take the sting out of the game. They utilised their full-backs to push our wing-backs into a back line of 5-3-2 instead of 3-5-2 , forcing us to defend deep and not press. England became less of a threat in transition moments, something Sterling, Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard thrive on. This also puts a great physical demand on Alli and Lingard, who have to cover a lot of ground at high intensity without the ball, making them less fresh and creative in possession.The way England have been prepared in terms of our organisation on set plays, penalty shootouts and the strict adherence to our possession game tells me Southgate does have a plan B and I believe we will need it at some point. It wouldn’t be a surprise if at some stage we see Sterling and Rashford on the pitch at the same time and we play a 3-4-3 system or 4-3-3.Overcoming obstacles and breaking boundaries has been the theme for England and if we can answer the inevitable questions of tactical flexibility, who knows, we may actually achieve what everyone believed to be impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef5a266c59dc1d218000313123da8b2423fcfcd/0_225_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7025918e5ce7a4b6c2cbaeed1353c2e 465w","title":"sweden england tomas brolin world cup","story":"I grew up having Tomas Brolin as one of my idols. That makes me different to everyone else on the ’s sport desk – and probably the whole company.For those who do not know who Brolin is I can tell you he was a wonderful footballer. He had brilliant technique, he had an extraordinary football brain and he was hard-working.The attacking midfielder from Hudiksvall in the north of Sweden was the main reason we were able to finish third at the 1994 World Cup. True, we had Martin Dahlin and Kennet Andersson scoring the goals, and Jonas Thern and Stefan Schwarz in central midfield but Brolin was the standout performer. Starting from the right of midfield, he had a free role and made all the difference.The summer of 1994 was an incredible experience. The sun was shining and the national team were exceeding all expectations. There was a party mood around the country. Everyone seemed happy and came together in a way that can happen when a national team do well.Two years later the same thing happened in England and I was lucky enough to experience that too, having moved to Coventry in 1995. This time it was Alan Shearer, Teddy Sheringham and Paul Gascoigne bringing a nation together. The summer was glorious and is, for me at least, the last time there was genuine excitement about the England team.For many Swedes it is a strange emotion to face England. It is like coming up against your big brother.Swedes have an unhealthy relationship with English football. We become obsessed with English teams from an early age. Since 1969 Swedish television has been showing top-flight English games on Saturday afternoon. As the Swedish season is in hibernation during the winter that was, for a long time, the only football to watch – live or on TV – for several months.A lot of Swedes support English clubs with more passion than they do their Swedish equivalents. It is hard to explain why but it is nevertheless the case. As it happens, Swedish football is also heavily influenced by English football after Roy Hodgson and Bob Houghton conquered the country with their 4-4-2 revolution in the late 70s.This led to an era of unprecedented success for Swedish clubs in Europe, with Malmö FF reaching the European Cup final in 1979 and IFK Göteborg lifting the Uefa Cup three years later (managed by a certain Sven-Göran Eriksson), playing a strict 4-4-2.The current Sweden team also play in that formation and in a sense they will feel more English than Gareth Southgate’s side and his 3-3-2-2 lineup. Despite the different tactics, however, there are many similarities between the managers. Both have taken a national team who were on their knees and made them something to be proud of.Both are calm iniduals but possess the fire necessary to succeed at the highest level. Janne Andersson’s touchline antics have been a regular feature of this World Cup and it was clear to see what the penalty shootout win against Colombia meant to Southgate.Back in 94 and 96 both teams reached the semis before losing to Brazil and Germany respectively. This time only one can get that far. For me, Saturday will be a strange experience. I am in a privileged position to support both teams, although there is no denying I want Sweden to go through. It is the country where I grew up and the country that made me who I am.And it is why I have Brolin as one of my heroes. Most of my colleagues look strangely at me when I talk about him with a glint in my eye. They remember him only as the unfit player who turned out for Leeds and Crystal Palace after that horrendous ankle injury against Hungary in November 1994.I may never succeed in convincing people that Brolin was a great footballer and it does not really matter. Football – and life – moves on at an extraordinary rate and that is why we should savour every moment. This summer, Sweden and England have been able to relive those two summers from the 90s while a younger generation has had its first taste of it.Enjoy it while it lasts. It may not happen again for another 20 years.Marcus Christenson is the football editor of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/578af4971d31e6c224f1c91d74128aac2f72fd5f/0_85_3208_1925/master/3208.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a45f855a59dd04a3eadaef20af1e4a5","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/383cfccd91ec0b20e094a2385ca85cc943e96ccd/0_31_1794_1076/master/1794.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f0ba00acde3bef2315f90616cad953","title":"world cup 2018 building up to uruguay v france and brazil v belgium live","story":"Jeffrey Earp has taken on board Liam Rosenoir’s tactical analysis.

Now, if you had to envisage a textbook Didier Deschamps expression, how close to this would it be?Russia has enjoyed a great World Cup as hosts, as good a time as any then to revisit this film on the country’s football culture.Some afternoon reading: it’s an oldie, but while Harry Kane is leading the Golden Boot standings on six, he’ll have some work in catching up with Just Fontaine in 1958.I’m going to check out of the liveblog for today. I leave you with a picture that will gladden the heart of every Uruguayan: Edinson Cavani, apparently playing a full part in training today. Bye!Tite has let slip the name of another player who will be in his starting line-up tomorrow. Not a big keeper of secrets, though this one isn’t an enormous surprise: he says Fernandinho will replace the suspended Casemiro.Kyle Walker is being interviewed live on YouTube right now. You can follow it here:This Uruguay side has a very different profile to Argentina. We will have to be patient. They are extremely organised in defence, they don’t concede many goals. But they also know how to attack and they’re very good with their counters. They switch from defence to attack with a direct style of play that’s really admirable, and have two extremely talented strikers. We need to be patient but we’ll need to have more than patience if we’re going to beat them.Big news just in from Moscow, where the city’s zoo has unveiled to the public a recently-born eagle, which has been named Akinfeev after the national team’s goalkeeper.Uruguay have been celebrating their victories with roast beef. What celebration would you prefer?Cavani has been a great figure at PSG. He’s a winner, he’s a leader, he’s respected in France as a player and also as a man. We’re getting ready for everything, whether he plays or does not play. We know they have other players who can play at a high level. It’s true that Cavani and Suarez are among the most beautiful attacking pairings in the world. They’re a very difficult team to handle and very strong on the counter, regardless of who’s playing up front.And about his own apparently poor penalty-saving record for his country:Well every match is independent. In a penalty shoot-out you need to be a bit lucky, but you can prepare, both from the goalkeeper’s point of view and also those who will take the penalties. Before that we will have to play 120 minutes. We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves. France are holding a press conference as I type, with Hugo Lloris at the mic. I’m eavesdropping, and will post highlights. First he’s asked about whethere reaching the quarter-finals counts as success for France.Let’s go step by step, shall we? We’re still in the competition, we feel the enthusiasm that’s behind the French team, but we’re getting ready to fight tomorrow. It’s going to be a big game. We’re focused on the match in hand. Uruguay are a very strong team, it’s going to be a big struggle and we’re going to have to be involved in all aspects of the game.And on the evolution of Paul Pogba:I think he’s maturing, he’s growing. He’s accumulating experience and he’s played more seasons, won more caps. He’s growing in the dressing room also, which is good as he’s a leader. He has a lot to offer the team and his team-mates. These big competitions are also good for revealing the true talent of players, and I’m sure that’s true of Paul.This is quite interesting. The big surprise I suppose is that France is much less interested this time than in 2014, when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals:Meanwhile the ongoing English-Colombian mud-slinging has continued with John Stones describing England’s vanquished round-of-16 opponents as “the dirtiest team I’ve ever played against”. “The best thing for us was to beat them at football, that will hurt them most,” he said. “They’re back on the plane going home and we’re in the next round.” So there. After announcing that Joao Miranda would captain the side, Tite has revealed another member of his starting line-up for tomorrow’s quarter-final against Belgium: Marcelo will return at the expense of Filipe Luis, having returned from his apparently mattress-related back-knack. This is what he had to say about it:Lovable footballing cherub Juninho has been asked for his thoughts about Brazil’s World Cup so far. And astonishingly he thinks they’re really good.This team struggled a bit, they didn’t expect to draw the first game. Then they got it together and they got two wins. And then against Mexico, it’s the knockout round, you can’t lose, that worry is on your mind, and Brazil got through it, they passed that emotional test.Brazil were very strong mentally, they suffered the first 20 minutes but after that they composed themselves. I think Brazil now go into the match against Belgium with a lot more confidence. They are now more sure of themselves, even though they are aware they are facing team that will be more difficult to beat than Mexico. They know that they are good players. They haven’t yet had to play in top gear. Technically they are solid. I think now they are solid emotionally.If there have been any other words or terms that have defined Russia 2018 for you, answers on a postcard to Simon Burnton who’s back in the chair for the rest of the afternoon.

Uruguay are clearly the more settled and organised outfit. While both coaches can call upon world class talent, Óscar Tabárez has a team that equals the sum of its parts. That has not always been the case for France under Didier Deschamps. Finding the personnel and system that bring the best out of his star names has been a problem for Deschamps, who tends to revert to the tried and tested when the going gets tough.Antoine Griezmann has underwhelmed so far at the World Cup, with his two goals coming from the penalty spot. France’s only fluent attacking display came in the last round against Argentina, when they hit La Albiceleste on the counter. That tactic is unlikely to be as successful against Uruguay. Breaking down a defence controlled by José Giménez and Diego Godín will be easier said than done, as their clubmate Griezmann is all too aware. “Uruguay will be like Atlético,” said Griezmann this week. “They will take their time, fall, go to the referee. We will have to get used to that because the match will be boring and they will want to bring us into that.” Prediction: Uruguay 1-1 France (Uruguay to win AET).Friday night’s match in Volgograd is shaping up to be the most entertaining of the quarter-finals. It’s the favourites against the leading scorers. Belgium have scored at least three goals in the three matches Roberto Martínez picked his first XI their second string were also victorious against England but just not so prolific. It will be intriguing to see what line-up Martínez selects against Brazil. Both Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli will hope to have earned a start after they turned the game against Japan on its head.There was no such drama in the for Brazil, who beat Mexico relatively comfortably and were the only side to win their last-16 match by more than one goal. That said, Tite’s side have not been prolific in Russia. Despite having the most shots (77) and the most shots on target (31), they have scored just seven goals and never more than two in a game. In comparison, Belgium have scored 12 times.This game could be a slow burner. Belgium have only scored in the first half in one of their four matches and Brazil have scored five of their seven goals after the interval. It should catch fire in the second half, though. Belgium will look to exploit Casemiro’s absence through suspension. Fernandinho is an extremely capable replacement but Martínez would be wise to push Kevin De Bruyne further forward to occupy his Manchester City teammate.Both teams have plenty of firepower but Brazil have been more reliable at the back. Tite’s men have conceded just one goal at this World Cup – from a corner in their first game against Switzerland – and their opponents have been restricted to just five shots on target across four matches. Brazil’s dependable defence should see them through. Prediction: Brazil 2-1 Belgium.It’s time we gave Sweden the respect they deserve, not only for defying the odds at the World Cup but for doing so consistently over the last 18 months or so. Since crashing out of Euro 2016 and losing their best ever player in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Janne Andersson has turned this squad into an incredibly functional team who are very difficult to beat. They have beaten Portugal, France and Italy since Euro 2016 and they topped a group where Germany were the clear favourites.They relish their underdog status and will not fear England. They boasting an impressive international record against England, with just one defeat in their last eight competitive encounters. They do have any star name but their record of five clean sheets in their last six matches shows they can rely on their defensive organisation.England have reasons to be concerned. They have struggled to create a great deal from open play since their scintillating start against Tunisia, particularly against the two stronger sides they have faced. Sweden have created seven more chances from open play than England but they do not have anyone as deadly as Harry Kane, who has scored six goals from just nine shots at this World Cup.England’s superior quality should just about win out, but it’s unlikely to be easy viewing yet again. Southgate’s side are the only quarter-finalists who have not kept a clean sheet in Russia so it may fall to Kane to bail them out once more. Prediction: England 2-1 Sweden.Having secured the upset of the round-of-16, if not the entire competition, Russia are beginning to believe in the seemingly impossible. With no optimism surrounding the squad or manager before the tournament, the hosts have already gone further than they would have expected and will see any progress from this stage as a huge achievement. Their odds to beat Croatia may not be as long as they were before the Spain match, but there remains little doubt about who will be the favourites in Sochi.That being said, Croatia’s performance in the round-of-16 left a lot to be desired. Zlatko Dalic’s side were among the most convincing teams in the group stage but looked well under par against Denmark. Russia manager Denis Cherchesov will have taken note of the way the Danes combated Croatia’s threat, particularly from Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic in midfield.Reports suggest that Alan Dzagoev, who was injured when Russia played Saudi Arabia in the first game of the tournament, could return, though that would likely force star man Aleksandr Golovin out wide. Denis Cheryshev should return and Russia are also likely to revert to a back four. The likely absence of left-back Yuri Zhirkov is a blow and we could see a crucial mismatch on that flank between his replacement, Fedor Kudryashov, and the lively Croatia winger Ante Rebic.Saturday night’s game is probably the toughest to call. These two sides have taken and conceded fewer shots on target than the other six quarter-finalists, so goals may be at a premium. The hosts will hope to ride the increasing wave of optimism but Croatia will surely improve from their last match and progress to the semi-finals. Prediction: Croatia 2-0 Russia.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dddb9777556d8181d764b1b9fd9776680a21ead5/0_277_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a765c25c83d6e9181766d9f2949fd5","title":"from mango salad to pineapple granita 12 chefs on their favourite heatwave dishes","story":"No one wants to be in a hot kitchen when the sun is beating down – so we asked food experts to share their coolest recipes, from chilled soups to rosewater lassiWhat to eat when it’s boiling outside is a riddle. The heat has a way of stunting your appetite, but not eating can make dealing with the heat physically that much more taxing. While consuming your bodyweight in ice-cream – the only edible equivalent of a e into the cold, cold sea – might feel sensible, science and India will tell you that a hot drink is what you need most. And when rail lines are threatening to buckle, using heat of any kind to cook a meal – or just boil the kettle – feels daft. We asked chefs from around the country for their tips on what to eat during a heatwave.A chilled beetroot soup is light, vibrant and quick: sweat red onions and red cabbage until soft then add in raw beetroot, diced very small – to ensure quick cooking – then cook until soft (about five minutes). Cover with boiling water, then cool before blitzing in a blender, with a good dollop of soured cream. Chill until cold, season to taste with salt and lime juice and top with chopped chives and more soured cream to serve.Quick-fry sliced garlic in olive oil, then turn off the heat and add finely chopped tomatoes and leave for 30 seconds. Stir in a handful of basil, roughly chopped, and season to taste. Toss through the pasta of your choice, finish with a drizzle of olive oil and – if you can face making them – a scattering of breadcrumbs.My go-to is a salad of fridge-cold green leaves – little gem is a good choice – torn into biggish pieces, fresh peas, broad beans and radishes, with a dressing of fridge-cold buttermilk (or, in a pinch, yoghurt), which naturally has such a cooling flavour, seasoned with salt, pepper and lime or lemon juice. Served with sourdough bread and a glass of rosé. Light, fresh, cooling.Take a ripe pineapple – it must be ripe – and peel it, then place it in the freezer overnight. The next day, grate it, and you get an instant granita. Delicious with some chopped fresh mint or basil folded through it. Serve in a tall sundae glass with creme fraiche, some finely sliced fresh pineapple, a few sprigs of fresh mint and a sprinkling of palm sugar. Spicy food cools you down by raising your core temperature and making you sweat: it causes your body to self-regulate. So, I’d opt for a Thai-style som tam salad: mix green mango and papaya, shredded, with lots of fresh coriander and peanuts. Dress with palm sugar, lots of red chilli, garlic, tomato and lots of lime juice, pounded together in a pestle and mortar to balance out the hot, sour, sweet and salty flavours.When it’s hot, we need more liquid and less alcohol, so a good, easy cocktail is something fortified – sherry, port, vermouth, Campari, martini – on the rocks, topped up with tonic water, soda, lemonade or a mix of all three, garnished with whatever you have to hand – a slice of orange or lemon, a sprig of mint or rosemary. For something very low-alcohol, tonic water with angostura bitters is great – the alcoholic content is minimal because you only need a few drops.Whizz up some almonds in blender – either blanched or ground – to obtain a paste, then very slowly add water to get a smooth soup. Season with sherry vinegar, a little crushed garlic, a little olive oil and some salt. Ladle into bowls and top with fresh fruit – cherries, grapes or, my favourite, really cold sweet melon. Drizzle with olive oil to serve. It is vegan and beautifully cooling.Fresh, raw, good-quality veg, which is bountiful in farmers’ markets right now, keeps well at room temperature: try tomatoes, spring onions, shaved artichokes, green beans and lightly blanched broad beans with loads of fresh herbs, dressed half an hour before you eat with olive oil, salt, lemon juice and zest or, if tomatoes, some chardonnay vinegar. Very little prep, which means more time outdoors.Pan-fried dover sole – or blonde ray, an excellent alternative to skate – is delicious at this time of year. And the beauty of cooking fish in the heat is that it is so quick: 4 minutes on either side and you’re sorted. Fry it on the bone so it retains its moisture then flake and stir through a fresh garden-pea salad, with some finely sliced raw shallots, fresh goats cheese, olive oil, salt and pepper. Add in some finely sliced red chilli to spice it up a bit if you like, and a little crispy bacon, or cured ham.You don’t need as much sustenance in the heat as you do in the cold, so fresh, green things are best – they’re satisfying, but also keep you feeling awake and light. And the most cooling veg is kohlrabi. Find a small one (red or white), peel it and slice very thinly. Lay out on a plate and dress with olive oil and lemon juice, then dot with fresh ricotta or – my favourite – sprouted puy lentils. And to drink, place sprigs of lemon verbena in a jug of ice-water. Beats lemon slices and cucumber hands down.The crucible of Indian eating is the constant heatwave – even in the winter, it’s hot. So, much of the food we make is geared towards cooling. One of the things my mother and grandmother always made me is lassi. Make the base mixing one part low-fat yoghurt with one part soy milk. Flavour with rose water, crushed green cardamom pods and pomegranate juice and season with a pinch of salt and some sugar, which realigns your electrolytes.Salad is an obvious choice, as is cured meat – both stand up well in the heat. In Italy, prosciutto is given to hospital patients: it’s very nutritious and highly digestible, which is also key when it’s very hot. If you are going to cook, it needs to be something very quick. I like to cook whole courgettes – the small, thin ones – very quickly in boiling water, with a little salt, for two minutes, then drain them and leave them to cool, before slicing them lengthways. I dress them with salsa verde – anchovy, parsley and mint – and serve with prosciutto on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2b68affb1d495df05582e9544d49f987e843a7/0_0_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668909257852c615e339d25d9d488b71","title":"big is beautiful the razzmatazz of the grand ultra","story":"Having only previously run low-key races, how would Adharanand Finn rise to the challenge of 120km in the Italian Dolomites? I’ve been running ultra marathons for about 16 months now, but I’ve been mostly keeping to low-key, smaller races such as the Ring O Fire in Anglesey, or the Miwok 100K in California. These races are intimate: you get to know the other runners, the race organisers. You get to feel like an oddball as you shuffle alone at dawn through quiet country towns with your backpack and head torch.But with the UTMB looming – the biggest ultra mountain trail race in the world – last week, it was time to get my first taste of the razzmatazz of the European ultra trail circuit, by taking part in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail in the Italian Dolomites.The world of ultra running may still be little known in the UK or the US, but in France, Spain and Italy, these races are huge. In the piazza of Cortina d’Ampezzo, just before the 11pm start, the town is alive with noise and bustle. As well as the 1,600 runners cramming into the start area, thousands of people have come out to cheer us on our way, sitting high up on walls, dancing on hotel balconies, as a huge sound system gees everyone up.The race is 120km along some spectacular and steep mountain trails. It’s a daunting prospect, so I hang near the back as the moment to start approaches. Up at the front, superstars of the sport such as the Americans Hayden Hawks and Tim Tollefson, Fernanda Maciel from Brazil, and the former Nepalese child soldier Mira Rai, are introduced to the crowd to huge cheers. You rarely see this much excitement or buzz at the start of a road race. This is a sport full of colour and adrenalin, with lean, chiselled mountain men and women with tattoos and expansive handshakes everywhere. And a lot of beards.And then, as the clock strikes 11, and to the strains of the race’s theme tune, The Ecstasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, we’re off. The showboating is over – now it’s time to run.With so many competitors, once we leave the town and head into the mountains, the narrow trails get congested to the point where I’m often forced to walk, or even stop completely. But this is good, I need to force myself to slow down in the early stages of these races. Too often in my fledgling ultra career I’ve set off too fast, too eager, and I’ve ended up being that guy slumped by the side of the trail at 90km, not sure how I’m going to continue. Not this time, I tell myself, as I wait for another bottleneck to clear.The night ticks slowly by, traipsing up and down through woodland trails, following the highway of head torches, until the chilly morning emerges suddenly and we find ourselves face to face with the immensity of Tre Cime, a huge trio of rocky peaks that seem otherworldly in the dawn light.After some pasta soup at a crowded aid station – who knew mini star-shaped pasta floating in vegetable stock could taste so good? – we begin the first long descent back down into the valley.These mountain races are, of course, a series of climbs and descents, and until today I’ve always struggled with both, having come to ultras from road running. But today, finally, it all starts to make sense.On the climbs, I have a new friend, a pair of Leki hiking poles. I’ve always been resistant to using poles in races. It reinforces the walking element of mountain trail running, which I try to ignore. I like to think of myself as a runner, not a hiker. This is ultra running, I tell myself, not ultra hiking. Besides, the runners I’m most impressed by, people such as Kilian Jornet and Zach Miller, seem to cope just fine without them.But the truth is that in a 120km mountain race like this, I’m going to spend a fair amount of time hiking up steep climbs, and poles certainly look like they might help. When I ran the 100 Mile Sud de France in October, I was pretty much the only person in the race without poles.Of course, you’re supposed to practice with poles before you use them. So you don’t trip yourself up. So you know how to store them when you’re not using them. So any number of a thousand possible unseen problems can be avoided in advance of the race. But practising with poles when you don’t live near any mountains is not easy. I tried them out on the coast path near my home in Devon, but the climbs are so short – even though they can be very steep – that I’m forever putting the poles away and getting them out again. It’s all good pole practice, but it slows your run down. So I do it once. It doesn’t seem so difficult.In the event, the race becomes the practice. By the time I’m finished, I have it nailed. I barely grip the poles, but let them mostly dangle in the straps around my wrists. That works better, and doesn’t rub my hands. And they really seem to help. It’s like having a rail to hold on to up the biggest ascents. Throughout the race, even though getting them out of my bag is a hassle, I use them on every climb.But it is the descents where things really click for me. I keep waiting for my legs to start complaining, but on each downhill I just let myself go, flying and skipping along through the field. From 900th position at the first checkpoint in the race, about 10 miles in, I gain around 100 places on every descent. People look at me racing by, particularly near the end, with a touch of annoyance. It does seem a little unfair to be making up so much ground on the downhills. They’re the easy bit. But why doesn’t everyone else go a bit faster?I know why. I’ve been there before, where your legs are so tired that even going downhill is a struggle, where your legs don’t want to, or can’t, lift your feet from the ground. Where all you can do to stop yourself sitting down is to keep up a slow, pained, forward shuffle.But after 10 ultra races, for the first time, I’m not that guy. I’m that other guy. The one who comes from nowhere, full of energy, skipping past you, and you think, bloody show off.In the end, I finish, 120km later and in 366th position, back in the buzzing town of Cortina. Twenty-one and a half hours. I grab my free beer and sit down in the square to take it all in. Something has shifted. My whole perception of time and distance seems to have changed, because suddenly it doesn’t seem that crazy to have been out running for so long. When I started ultra running, the thought of running for more than four hours felt a little insane. I remember the first time my GPS clicked past 30 miles and finding it hard to process. But now, well it seems sort of normal. Seventy-five miles is a long run, sure. But not that long.Still, I’m shivering and tired and night is falling, so I’m grateful that Giovanni, the owner of Hotel Villa Argentina, is a runner and has given everyone in the race his phone number so that when we finish he will come and pick us up and scoot us back to the hotel bar for pizza and lemon soda, followed by a long, warm bath. All those things that are just bloody incredible after a long run. Even if it’s only a 21.5-hour-long run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb22606db67bee3a070487bc1335173d9c93322/0_44_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7525b4e5e6fb00851e0b7c27b68bfcfd","title":"moving stories the great student halls v home debate","story":"For some, getting a room in halls of residence is the best way to begin life at university. Others want low-cost living at home for as long as possible. But what are the benefits of each option, and is it still possible to have a full university experience if you’re living away from uni? “When you first arrive in London, especially from abroad, it’s great to be living in university halls,” says Victoria Smith Graterol Chirinos, 19, a journalism student at Goldsmiths, University of London. You’re immediately connected to life in the capital.“I came to London from Basel in Switzerland and I love the city. There’s so much going on, there is never a day with nothing to do. It’s easy to get into central London from the Goldsmiths campus in New Cross. I do that often and enjoy the vibe, but I always like to get home to a quieter, residential area,” she says. Students living in halls will generally have their own room in a shared flat, and it’s a good way to meet people. “The nice thing about living in halls is that there is always someone there to hang out with,” says Jaxson Mannes, 18, a first-year psychology student at Goldsmiths. He’s an ambassador for the university’s Surrey House halls of residence, where students live in flats, sharing a kitchen. Part of his job, which is paid for by the university, is to provide information and encourage a sense of community.“Most of my role is planning events and activities to engage students and make it fun for the whole of the year, not just welcome week. When there was a cold spell earlier in the year, I noticed students were holed up in their rooms, so I started a weekly music listening party in the Orangery, our common room, and I used some of my budget to provide free food,” he says.On the other hand, it’s much cheaper to live at home with your parents, says first-year politics student Niquella Simpson-West, 19. “I like living at home and I have a good relationship with my parents,” she says. “It didn’t seem worth paying rent when I could commute.“The drawback is the time and money it takes for travel to go to the library or events on days when you don’t have any lectures or seminars.”For those living nearer to the university, an advantage of New Cross and nearby areas like Brockley, Peckham and Camberwell, is that private rented accommodation is more affordable than in many other parts of London in zone 2. Some students, such as 24-year-old Danielle Jombla, who is studying management and entrepreneurship, arrange their own rentals before they arrive. She wondered if she would miss out by not being in halls, but found it easy to meet people. “At the start of the course we had the opportunity to take part in icebreakers in order to get to know one another. One of the challenges I had was that I can be quite shy, so I had to make a real effort. Whether you live on campus or not, you can make friends and enjoy life at university. It’s about being friendly and putting yourself out there to be sociable,” she says.No matter where you live, you can feel part of things, says Karyma Ellis, 24, a final-year music degree student. “I’ve tried all three options. For my first term, I lived at home in Islington. Then a place in halls came up for the rest of the year – and since then I have been in private rented accommodation,” she says.Living with her family meant saving money on rent, but Ellis was nervous at first about losing out on the wider scene. “I was adamant that I was not going to miss out on anything and I joined a Facebook group for Goldsmiths commuter students. We met on the first day and we kept it up, meeting a lot of new people along the way. In welcome week there were team events, and alongside the halls teams there were teams for students who weren’t in halls. I stayed all day and went to everything I could,” she adds.“The key thing, whether you are living around the corner or living an hour away, is to make an effort.”The university’s head of accommodation services, Rocchi Acierno, says: “Many students decide to live in university halls for the first year, while others prefer to stay at home with their families and commute or share rented flats and houses. The choice is very much down to the inidual.”  Although some may feel living in halls will give them the full student experience, he believes there is no reason why anyone deciding to keep costs down by living at home should miss out on the wider university life.“We recognise that a lot of students are living with their families or renting privately, so our campus support officers are on hand to help all students who need advice out of hours, not just those in our halls,” he adds. “Our student hall ambassadors are there for students to speak to, and they also arrange social events for residents. Even if you’re not in halls, there are social events going on for everyone at the students’ union or organised by the different clubs and societies.”Goldsmiths, University of London is based on a single-site campus in New Cross, south-east London.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

I have been at that door so many times. The one you walk through into his apartment, or let him through into yours, and something shifts. It’s as quick as the click when the optometrist slides a new lens into the eye-test machine: a clear, almost weightless little sliver of a thing, but with the power to make the world resolve into clarity – or blur out, leaving you nauseous and unbalanced.Once, it was the door to the celebrated journalist’s apartment that I stumbled through, aged 21. I’d taken a train to New York to meet him for career advice and, unexpectedly, he had suggested we meet at a bar, then bought me several martinis. But then again, I drank them. Whose fault was the sex that ensued? And then there was the door to an AirBnB I rented in Uruguay in 2014, with a pushy local journalist I had just met trailing behind me. As I fumbled with my keys, I remember thinking: how did I get here?Me too. Isn’t that frightening? That almost every woman today can say these words? Finally, we are having a conversation about the sexual harassment – and the sexual encounters – that have left us feeling damaged. And yet there’s a kind of uncertainty still hovering around the unfolding conversation – something still tucked into the shadows. Some people have said women are being inconsistent, re-remembering encounters they hadn’t had a problem with at the time. Others wonder why women – particularly young women – are feeling so fragile, acting as if they have been terribly wounded by something as apparently minor as a leer.Complaints about boorish behaviour or lame one-night stands, this critique goes, have the potential not only to delegitimise real accusations of rape, but #MeToo’s whole message. When a writer recently accused the novelist Junot Díaz of “forcibly kissing” her (which he denied) and other women came forward to say Díaz had acted aggressively towards them in public, a friend of mine in her 40s – a feminist who writes with empathy about women who kill their abusive partners – worried that Diaz was being pilloried for “assholery”, not legally actionable crimes. Just after saying that, though, this friend began to recount her own first kiss. The boy had shoved her hard up against a fence. She started to laugh, as if to pass it off as a wacky youthful memory, like a zit popping during a job interview. But it was clear something in her still wanted to cry.The problem is, it’s this ill-defined area between “assholery” and attempted rape that troubles many women. This is hard to talk about, and increasingly so, as we perceive the damage that just remembering can apparently wreak. When I asked if it was “the right time” to write about my experience with the New York journalist, another male writer said to me, “Hell, no!”, telling me that “careers are being ruined”. But I don’t want to ruin anybody’s career.We are having these conversations at last, but we are not talking much about the historical context. I think this is the key to understanding how women are feeling now. For me, born in 1983, the context was the 90s – a peculiar era, caught between the confidence that there had been fabulous progress in the relationship between the sexes, and the smouldering remnants of a past in which bold women were feared and ridiculed.In the 1990s, the pressure on young people to succeed was intense. Women’s bodies and their sexual choices became the focus of ever-harsher scrutiny, and the expectation was that they would be perfect.I remember leaving my childhood home for college in 2001. Among the items I packed were a pair of what everybody then was calling “fuck-me boots”: knee-high black leather boots with a four-inch heel. Like my textbooks, I felt the fuck-me boots were preparing me for adulthood – for a decisive step out of the self-doubt of my teens. It wasn’t that I associated adulthood with fucking. It was more that I was determined to become the kind of woman who was fuckable in just the right way. I still remember the look I gave myself in the mirror I’d pasted on the back of my dorm-room door the first night I put the boots on, to wear to a frat party, along with a slash of lipstick in berry pink. It was a look of wonder and hope: it felt like a magic mirror, and with those boots on I could stare myself into what I wanted to become.The hopes of the end of the millennium were the mirror in which I saw myself. But the young woman there was only a picture. In flesh and blood, by the time I became a woman, I had already been singed by those smouldering embers of the past. And thus, I entered adulthood as two people: the image my era wanted me to be, and the other woman, the hidden one, the one with a body.It’s 1993. I’m almost 10. In apartments across the US, Madonna’s new book, Sex, graces coffee tables, the cover depicting her in the throes of an orgasm. My family has just moved from the city to a house in the suburbs. My parents gave me – the child – the “master bedroom”. It had a wall-length closet covered in mirrored doors. I woke up every day staring at myself.It was a narcissistic decade, but it was a strange narcissism, premised on the idea we could remake ourselves any way we liked, virtually from scratch. People came home from vacations in Germany with pieces of the Berlin Wall the feeling was not that they’d got a memento of German reunification, but a piece of the ultimate wall, some figurative wall whose crumbling represented the tumbling-down of a whole world. My father, a former Reagan administration official, filled up our house with kitsch he found on trips to Moscow. Muddling around for the house keys, I’d touch medallions of Stalin and Lenin in the bowl in the hall.The message I got from these objects was that enmity, conflict, maybe even pain – all the kinds of things my parents told me they’d had to fear as kids in the early 60s, when their schoolteachers made them hide under their desks in case of a Soviet nuke – were all some kind of big joke. We could keep Stalin in our house as an amusement, like those 19th-century Europeans who displayed the shrunken heads of conquered Polynesian tribes.Unmanageable male lust was one of those things we hoped would become a kind of relic that we didn’t take all that seriously. Men in that decade’s pop culture tended to be harmless – think the goofs of Seinfeld and Friends. One of the bestselling American books of the early 90s, You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, reassured readers that resolving miscommunications between the sexes was actually easy, if we just understood how to do it. Solutions were big then. A couples therapist named Harville Hendrix sold hundreds of thousands of copies of a guide called Getting the Love You Want, which unravelled “the mystery of romantic attraction” and answered “humanity’s yearning” in just 384 pages.I remember my early girlhood as surrounded by a shimmering halo of possibility. Explaining the long-term inconveniences of an oesophageal surgery I’d had as an infant, my pediatrician told me with a wink that the only thing I could never be was an astronaut: as if, without that little fault, I’d have definitely gone to Mars. My friends and I loved the cartoon The PowerPuff Girls: “Sugar, spice, and everything nice,” the narrator intoned. “These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. But Prof Utonium accidentally added a can of whoopass to the concoction!” The PowerPuff Girls combined traditional female perfection (Mary Jane shoes, pigtails) with post-feminist female badassery (they whooped bad guys).The success of MTV’s Real World – not, it was clear, real – confirmed that reality didn’t really matter the only things that had to be real were our dreams. Oprah was the preacher of that decade. She told us we just didn’t have to believe in bad things any more. Fear, she said, was a useless emotion it was all in our minds. Failure and lasting heartbreak were the monsters of the human childhood, which just vanished as soon as we opened the closet door. Her frequent guest, the motivational author Iyanla Vanzant, told a live audience in New York: “You can use words to totally redefine reality. What I do when I hear myself say ‘can’t’ is, I cancel it out. Cancel the word. Cancel the thought. You shouldn’t have any ‘problem’. ‘Problem’ means you are powerless. ‘Problem’ means you are weak. Say ‘ine opportunity’.”It wasn’t clear how men would fit into the picture of young 90s women’s futures. What guy on Seinfeld or the Simpsons could keep up with an ambitious woman? The lead male character in American Pie, the classic 90s comedy, tried to fornicate with a pastry.In sex education classes, we spent endless time watching videos of sperm penetrating an egg, or labelling diagrams of the testes there was no sense of a real man connected to these sexual organs, but there was a firm message of fear. Our instructors terrified us with stories of how condoms could fail, exposing us to STIs that would destroy our potential we were taught about sex in the same classes as hard-drug awareness, implying it was a bit like cocaine, a quick thrill that could prove ruinous.Though we were supposed to be the first generation that didn’t need men in a material sense, my friends and I in high school were absolutely obsessed with guys. We talked about little else. We didn’t know what men were for, but I think we wondered whether they could turn out to be the secret key – a kind of final stage in our self-development, or a confirmation that we had become as awesome as we were supposed to be. When I think back to that time, I remember a scene from my favorite teen TV show, Dawson’s Creek. Pacey, a boy, tried to tell two of his female friends about a serial killer who was reportedly stalking the region. “He cuts out women’s hearts,” he warned. Joey, a girl, just laughed. Jen, the other girl, smiled beatifically and said: “He’s probably just looking for love.” A powerful enough woman, in other words, could be a literal alchemist, turning even the worst heart-eating murderer into a good guy.Female ambition was purportedly encouraged. But when it actually manifested in a real woman, it was often depicted as deadly, contradictory or grotesque. When Fergie, the Duchess of York, tried to recover from her orce by entering business, a nasty Independent article, written by two women, mocked her efforts: “Goodness, she would have a jolly good go at anything!” Donald Trump had a tower and a plane, but it was Imelda Marcos, the wife of Philippine dictator Ferdinand, with her vast collection of shoes, who became the decade’s symbol of greed. In her 1991 biography of Nancy Reagan, Kitty Kelley accused the president’s wife of secretly “ruling the White House with a Gucci-clad fist”. Diana was applauded for rejecting her ugly prince. But she was also painted as reckless for getting killed with her playboy lover in a car chase with paparazzi.Around the time the Bobbitts were in the news, I started to become very fearful. I wrote diary entries. Anxiety – over my grades, over the need to be perfect – was a theme. “I will get better and better at sledding,” I encouraged myself. I impressed on myself the need to be good, even at the things I did just for fun. “Goals: to work harder. Spend more time on homework and less time drifting away and ending up with my nose in a book.” After a report card came home, I mourned: “As the grownups say, I am not living up to my potential.” I was eight years old.Coexisting with the sense of limitless possibility was a strong counterstrain of dread. If life in the late 20th century could theoretically be perfect, then any wrong step was potentially catastrophic. On an Oprah episode called Stranger Danger, an “anti-abduction” specialist taught a group of very young children how to evade potential kidnappers by doing things such as jumping into rubbish bins or kicking out the brake lights of the car if a paedophile locked them in the boot. “Fantastic way to signal the police,” he’d say.The kids in the show, though, struggled to contain giggles. In that situation, who would remember to kick out the brake light? I remember learning stuff like this – the sinkholes to misfortune I might stumble across in the future, and how to tiptoe around them – and just laughing, too. It felt so much easier, and more powerful, to imagine danger just didn’t exist or could be risen above, as the girls in Dawson’s Creek did, than to acknowledge we could screw up our glittering destinies.At 16, I got my first boyfriend. But I couldn’t enjoy it. I was timid and terrified, unable to voice my feelings or concerns. I felt muzzled by contradictions: love could be everything love was a distraction. He wasn’t the right guy he might be the right guy and I would blow it. I had become detached from my real instincts, because love was an achievement, rated, in some vague way, by outside forces.When my boyfriend grew depressed and increasingly angry, I felt I had to figure out how his behaviour was actually due to my actions. As a young woman, the infinite power I’d been told I had turned out to have given me infinite responsibility – and that was a terrible burden. He was like a gear in the complicated but glorious machine I was assembling called my life, and if he went wonky, it must be my fault.I spent a lot of time sobbing in car parks. When I broke up with him, I brought him a fruit basket. I wanted so much for a bad thing to be good, to make a “ine opportunity”. As I got in my car to leave, he threw himself under the front wheels. The emotion I recall is numbness, a sense of profound dissociation. The more messed-up the evening got, the more I had to pretend it was almost funny, a “crazy” story I would later tell my girlfriends – proof of promising qualities I had been assured of in magazine personality quizzes, like adventurousness and a willingness to let life unfurl in all its wackiness.The writer Andrew Solomon has explored the lives of prodigies, gifted children burdened from a very young age by great expectations. The experience, he writes, is “isolating, mystifying, petrifying”. I think many millennial women, and not just the wealthiest ones, had youths a little like prodigies. We were invested with the hope that the suffering of generations of women who had gone before us hadn’t been in vain. Recently, a friend told me that her mother got into Harvard in the 1970s but chose not to go because of the explicit inequalities for women that remained there. “They had a male-only library. She wasn’t allowed to be in the marching band,” she said. My friend felt that her mother was in awe – even jealous – of our condition, apparently freed from that overt discrimination. My friend recalled that she grew up being told: “This is how good you get it. You get to live in this time when everything is possible.”My mother, the nerdy daughter of penniless Polish immigrants, loved literature and music. But, when she applied to college, her father insisted she study science, and she did so, because daddy was still king in the 60s. Defeated, she dropped out. She felt, I think, trailed by the shadow of opportunities denied. Her determination that I not screw up my special opportunity became, at times, overwhelming. When I came home with a B in geometry, I got chewed out as if I had written off the car. When I looked deep into my mother’s eyes, sometimes I thought I saw a plea: tell me you are going to make it.It sounds paradoxical, but all the power we were told we had led often not to courage, but to hesitation, rationalisation, even self-hatred and self-harm. It was portrayed as a liberation to have the chance to be everything all at once, brainy and gorgeous. But in practice, it was crushing: if we could be anything, we had to be ideal.The beauty rituals of the 90s focused on scraping, plucking and driving out. We knew we had to be godly, so we became like monks, obsessed with flaying ourselves and exorcising the evidence of sin within us in the form of stray hairs and blackheads, which we cruelly tried to rip off of our delicate faces with special tape. Our 90s models of beauty – Kate Moss, Posh Spice – were hollow-eyed, so blemishless and skinny that they seemed to be melting away. The beloved teen magazine Seventeen played the role of our advisor on romance, and it was a harsh tutor, reminding us incessantly of all the ways we could fail. One recurring feature was the quiz, dedicated to helping young women identify and root out their neuroticisms. “Quiz: Do You Play Mind Games?”, “Are You Overreacting?”, “Are You Paranoid?” Another feature was “550 Guys on First Moves and the Worst Thing a Girl Could Do”.We were rated on everything. I got graded at summer camp. In high school, we took the Myers-Briggs type-indicator test, which adjudicated our entire personalities and generated quantitative values for our traits we could even be rated on how much we liked to have fun. This was the insidiousness of the decade’s philosophy: in the guise of liberation, it swallowed up everything and directed it towards incessant self-perfection.Educators who work with prodigies know they often become paralysed because any action at all would be a betrayal of the ideal performance. Or they start to sabotage themselves. Many girls I knew began to cut themselves. Young-adult novels began to proliferate in which the teenage protagonists became grievously ill, bedridden, or died. In recalling her thoughts of suicide, the writer Porochista Khakpour described it as the only choice that had not yet proved itself imperfect. In an environment where being extraordinary is never quite enough, being dramatically, pointedly off the mark becomes a way to get attention. A friend of mine and I privately called the girls who cut themselves the “Arrogant Suicidals”. We assumed they were doing it to stand out.It makes me sick to recall that I presumed feeling suicidal could be just another performance. But it might have been, at times, because everything was. The longer everybody tried to be amazing, the harder we all had to look for marks of distinction in paradoxical places.We longed so much to step or fall off the narrow tightropes we walked. In the early days of the internet, a lot of kids my age took a quiz called the “Purity Test”. Among the hundreds of questions were ones such as:“Have you used a drug to lower someone’s inhibitions about sexual activity?”“Have you had sex with a woman who was asleep and she didn’t wake up?”“Have you ever accepted money for sex?”“Have you ever masturbated into a houseplant?”It wasn’t entirely clear whether it was good or bad to get a low score – to be “pure” – but I recall it was judicious to be pure and cool to be impure, and we kind of had to be both.The people who designed the purity test were high achievers: students at MIT. I suspect the test reflected fantasies of getting off the dizzying fast track. But it’s telling, and sad, that their fooling around also yielded a grade. In the end, “impurity” was just another proof of accomplishment. In the test’s logic, prostitution and rape were almost wickedly charming, marks of daredevil extraordinariness. Early on in the iconic 90s film American Beauty, Angela, the movie’s ingenue, fields creepy attention from an older, married man. She converts that problem into a ine opportunity.“If people I don’t even know look at me and want to fuck me, I really have a shot at being a model, which is great!” she says. “Because there’s nothing worse in life than being ordinary.”Years later, in 2014, on a reporting trip to Montevideo, I hosted a dinner for local artists and journalists. One of them gave me the eye across the table. We ended up at a bar. He walked me home to my AirBnB. We went upstairs. I recall these steps as feeling both discomfiting and inevitable, as if someone else was moving my feet. The whole time I walked, I thought brightly: I can always go back.But I couldn’t. My first step towards the AirBnB had arisen from a wish to be fancy-free – but then it became a rule. For if I’d had the power in that situation, then I’d have been able to make the best choice at any given time. To stop walking, to change my mind, was to admit that I had made a mistake, been stupid – a crippling admission.After I let him into my AirBnB, he dropped his pants and blocked the door with his body. Now this was real. This was bad. This was the point at which I was supposed to kick out the brake light of the car to signal the police. But all I could manage was to feebly voice what had become for me, by then, a go-to excuse for ending such encounters: that my vagina was broken. I said it had a “disorder”.Unfortunately, my excuse didn’t work. He just grinned and said: “Maybe mine will be the dick that will fix that for you.” Horrible – but wasn’t that kind of always the hope? That a man would come along and put the last piece into the not-yet-quite-perfect puzzle of our feminine lives?It felt awkward, even childish, to hit him or to scream. I also felt I owed him a long explanation for my inconsistency, even though I had not yet managed to explain it to myself. Suffocating under contradictions, I just lay back and resigned myself. I think so many of us resigned ourselves to situations that were wrong, not because we were powerless, but because we thought this was the way for us to experience our power. To shove the man, or to scream, felt like an admission to myself I had misjudged the situation in the first place, and I’d always been taught that to lose control of a situation was a mark on your character. A failure.I trekked to his office the next morning to return a sweater he’d left behind. He gave me a warm smile, which I returned with a queasy one. I didn’t know what to think of myself, and in that void, I didn’t want to seem inconsistent. I think he thought my solicitousness meant I’d had a good time. And why shouldn’t he have? How could he have known all the fears and concerns I had brought in with me to that AirBnB, when we, as a culture, go so terribly far to conceal them?But I’ve thought of Montevideo during the #MeToo conversation. There are many of these kinds of ambiguous yet heartbreaking encounters that women have not yet voiced. Some commentators have fretted about “evolving standards” – as if all of a sudden women just decided that things they used to be cool with aren’t so cool any more. There is surprise at some of the #MeToo stories – when strong women such as Amy Schumer reveal that they endured abuse, sometimes for years. But it all makes sense to me. We aren’t changing our standards. We are remembering things. Why should we be surprised that women are only now remembering, or understanding, what really happened to them, when, in the time that so many of us came of age, we told ourselves that everything we knew about life and human behaviour could be forgotten, that we had left the past behind?How many times have I recounted a truly scary or hurtful encounter with a man to my girlfriends as a jolly story? But, it turns out, it just isn’t funny or adventurous to see your boss masturbate on a houseplant. It’s traumatic. There are, perhaps, only so many times a woman can deny the impact of such experiences before she loses it. Every one of them dredges up the memories of the others, cumulatively, until one day a stranger whistles at you on the street, or you read an account of some random celebrity’s misdeeds, and you find yourself raving on Twitter like a person who has been halfway destroyed.Yes, some of these experiences are minor. But what’s behind them is not. Love as triumph, love as ruin. Sex as weightless, sex as incredibly freighted. Men as pointless, men as the whole point of life’s game. Women as witches, magicians women so fragile they cut themselves open in high-school bathrooms. Women as careful, women as carefree.In some of the #MeToo critiques, I perceive an anger that younger women weren’t the perfectly empowered people their elders had hoped they would be. The older generation had prepared the ground, after all, and fought their battles. To acknowledge how younger women have struggled would entail a painful admission that the battles of previous generations may not have been won as decisively as they had hoped. We were told, decades ago, that we were starring in a totally new story, and that we didn’t have to experience any of these painful conflicts. But that only made our ultimate experience of them more painful.Nine months after it began, I sense an ebbing of some energy around #MeToo – a tiredness perhaps an acknowledgement that the contradictions and painful realities it revealed are too big to solve fast. Frantically firing offending males may make it harder for women to tell their complex stories. But the suffering of men who have been publicly accused of sexual assault or misconduct must not shut us up now, either. I want more stories. I want more curiosity about the complexity of women’s lives – instead of a panicky retreat from the conversation.We would like to believe that clearer rules around “positive consent” will put an end to much of this difficulty. But I worry a little about “positive consent”. It still puts the onus on the woman to perfectly manage the situation – this time with non-verbal cues, communicating desire or retreat with a flicker of the eye. It wasn’t a better description of “consent” that I needed while growing up. I was taught endlessly what I should and shouldn’t consent to for my life not to go wrong. All that emphasis on all my power to make things turn out right ended up paralysing me.I lacked a perception of what I wanted. I think that’s one of the things that lurks in the shadows of #MeToo. How to enable young people to discover what they really want and need out of love and sex – this is what we should be talking about in sex-education classes. Forget about putting condoms on bananas. But as long as we venerate doing and solving – making things more efficient and perfect – it will be hard to glimpse what we really want out of sex or of love.Main illustration by Nate Kitch• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aeae96c86c8ab2e9e9c4a3bb311eaa45262d1eb/0_19_6042_3625/master/6042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ccacc21f3990e751591b06993d84453","title":"study law to open up a world of opportunities","story":"Politician, lecturer, human rights campaigner – a law degree will set you on the path for a career at the top Not only does a law degree or postgraduate course open up a wide variety of careers within the legal sector – it can also set you up for a future career at the top, in anything from business to politics.International law, for example, is a fascinating and fast-moving area. Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e83a874da059b4b34ce5824b9d2a91491b42def3/1267_200_2233_1340/master/2233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b317d48b76ca08761013b0ea01269d7","title":"david davis says mays new brexit customs plan is unworkable","story":"Brexit secretary criticises PM’s compromise proposal, saying EU will not accept itDavid Davis has told Theresa May her “best of both worlds” plan for Brexit is unworkable, in a letter written as details emerged of the prime minister’s proposed new customs arrangement.The Brexit secretary raised concerns that the “facilitated customs arrangement” compromise plan – which would allow the UK to set its own tariffs on goods arriving in the country – was too similar to a discarded idea that the EU had already rejected.Downing Street indicated that under the plan tracking devices would e used to determine where the goods would ultimately end up, and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.Details of the plan are still emerging and it is not certain whether the cabinet will back it at a key Brexit meeting at Chequers on Friday. But the early hints were that it would be acceptable to other key Brexiters such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, paving the way for the publication of a strategy white paper next week.The “third way” customs proposal is intended to end the cabinet clash between the “maximum facilitation” model favoured by Brexiters, which relies on using technology to ensure the correct tariffs are levied on goods crossing the UK border, and May’s once favoured “customs partnership”, which involves the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU.Davis’s concern is that the EU will block any deal for the UK to police its borders. The Daily  reported that in his letter he said the plan was doomed because it amounted to a customs partnership with some additional technological elements. The EU has previously rejected both the maximum facilitation and customs partnership models.Downing Street says its plan could be in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. May travelled to Berlin on Thursday afternoon to discuss the progress of Brexit negotiations with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The prime minister is under intense pressure from EU leaders and industry to provide greater clarity, but No 10 has said it will not detail new customs plans to Merkel before they are discussed in cabinet.As she arrived for the bilateral meeting with Merkel, May said the UK was about to propose “a substantial way forward” which she claimed would “enable the pace and intensity of negotiations to increase”.However, Merkel said time was running short to strike a Brexit deal and it was important for Britain and Germany to keep talking. “Negotiations will now enter a crucial phase. You know that on behalf of the European Union the commission is leading those negotiations with the United Kingdom,” she said. “So there are a number of issues that we would like to discuss here also bilaterally, a number of substantive issues.”Before Friday’s away day, there is also ministerial concern that the focus on the details of future customs arrangements is too narrow. Remain-leaning cabinet ministers fear it leaves out the crucial services sector, while Brexiters are nervous that the meeting will fail to address freedom of movement.Britain’s biggest vehicle manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, said it needed greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK. “A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year,” said its chief executive, Ralf Speth.Two other major employers, BMW and Airbus, have said their positions in the UK would be in doubt if their production processes were threatened by the terms of the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb1581dd690957f414f93d14bf076f26f8083f2/0_104_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bd988a1c9ef82438b336cf92192b3fc","title":"esther mcvey refuses to widen apology over claim she misled mps","story":"Work and pensions secretary responds to urgent question as Labour says she ‘has clearly broken ministerial code’Esther McVey has refused to apologise for misleading MPs about the progress of welfare reforms after being dragged before parliament to hear further demands that she should step down from her cabinet post.The work and pensions secretary was asked on Thursday to answer an urgent question about claims she had wilfully misled parliament on three key points in a highly critical National Audit Office report to make it look as if the programme was doing well.But after hearing claims that she had been “dissembling” and calls for her resignation, McVey declined to go further than apologise for claiming that the independent auditor wished to speed up the process. The urgent question was granted after Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, sent an unprecedented open letter on Wednesday claiming that McVey had misled MPs about his organisation’s views on universal credit, a programme that rolls six separate benefits into one.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, told MPs: “The secretary of state should be ashamed that she has been forced to come to this house again. If she misread this report so badly this brings in to question her competence and her judgment. If she did read the report and chose to misrepresent its findings, she has clearly broken the ministerial code. Either way, she should resign.”McVey said she planned to meet Morse on 9 July, adding: “From my interpretation of what was said and the words that I used, I apologised for and came to the house.” She reiterated the assertion that the highly critical NAO report failed to take into account recent changes made to the flagship benefit.She said: “On the significant changes this government has brought in this year, those effects cannot have fully been taken into account because they are still being rolled out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08c013f053072a72340ff46119558390a19a09dc/1346_1319_2422_1454/master/2422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a803e6fd5181e4cbe116c91edfa0e82","title":"brexit david davis refuses to deny reports hes told may her new customs plan wont work politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenAnd, since we’re talking about a possible UKUS trade deal, this, from the ’s Europe editor Peter Foster, is interesting.This is from Hugh Bennett, deputy editor of the pro-BrexitCentral website.And these are from Owen Paterson, the Brexiter Conservative former environment secretary.This is from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Lucy Allan.Theresa May’s spokeswoman has rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion that the proposed Brexit plan would make it impossible to then make a new trade deal with the US – but would not comment on the idea it could become more difficult.Asked about the Spectator report (see 3.30pm), she said:The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US that reflects the strength of our trading and investment relationship, and as you know the president has also made it clear that he is keen to sit down and talk with the UK about that. And the PM and the president will obviously have a chance to discuss trade next week … What I can be very clear on is that it is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.The spokeswoman said she would not “get into speculation” about what might or might not be in a Brexit deal. Asked if she could rule out May’s plan making a trade deal with the US more difficult, she said: “I’ve given the answer. I’m not going to go any further on that.”My colleague Peter Walker is just out of the the Number 10 lobby briefing.But the Spectator’s James Forsyth is not saying Theresa May’s Brexit plans would make a trade deal with the US impossible. He quotes a line in the paper circulated to ministers saying the plan would probably make it impossible to give the US the sort of trade deal they would want. (See 3.30pm.) Forsyth writes:The paper is explicit that this deal ‘would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal’ as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s ‘array of standards’.Fifteen British MEPs have signed a joint statement saying the revelation that the Electoral Commission has found that Vote Leave broke election spending rules during the EU referendum justifies a second referendum. In the statement, organised by the Green MEP Molly Scott Cato, they say:The international treaty on democratic conduct, the Venice Commission, to which the UK is a signatory, has ruled that campaigning over-spends are adequate grounds for annulling an election result. However, given that we have no domestic remedy in the UK for this occurrence, but given the evidence of breaches of electoral law by both the main Leave campaigns, the mandate for Brexit is seriously undermined.These new revelations, following on from allegations of social media manipulation, fatally undermine the legitimacy of the referendum result. We believe that there is a simple straightforward way to address this by supporting the call for a people’s vote on the Brexit deal. Those of us who respect the rule of law have no need to cheat and have nothing to fear from the people’s judgement.The other MEPs who have signed it are: Charles Tannock (Conservative) Catherine Bearder (Lib Dem) Seb Dance, Catherine Stihler, David Martin, Mary Honeyball, Derek Vaughan, Jude Kirton-Darling, Theresa Griffin, and Julie Ward (all Labour) Julie Girling (independent) Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru) and Jean Lambert and Keith Taylor (both Green.)Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative backbench Brexiter, is not happy about the leaks from the cabinet’s Brexit paper (see 3.30pm and 3.36pm), the ’s Steven Swinford reports.No 10 sources are saying the Spectator is wrong. They don’t accept the claim that Theresa May’s Brexit plan would probably rule out a trade deal with the US. (See 3.30pm.)We are expecting to be told more at the Downing Street afternoon lobby briefing.The Guido Fawkes website (which, like the Spectator, is pro-Brexit) has had a similar leak about the Theresa May Brexit plan. The proposal would mean the UK accepting “EU rulings on all level playing field issues, environment and social policy, effectively maintaining ECJ jurisdiction in the UK”, the website says.According to the Spectator’s James Forsyth, the paper which has been circulated amongst cabinet ministers today says that, under Theresa May’s Brexit proposals, a trade deal with the US would become almost impossible. That is because May is proposing a deal that would effectively keep the UK in the single market for goods and agrifoods, meaning the UK would have to align with EU standards in these areas.What has really riled ministers is the section on what this deal with the EU would mean for future trade deals. The paper is explicit that this deal ‘would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal’ as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s ‘array of standards’.Brexiteers are taking this as Theresa May effectively ruling out a post-Brexit trade deal with the US just days before the US President arrives in this country.Jeremy Corbyn has been in The Hague today, speaking to the Dutch Labour party. He told them that European progressive parties had to reject austerity and the “broken neoliberal model” if they wanted electoral success. He said:My message for our European sister parties is simple: reject austerity or face rejection by voters.If our parties look like just another part of the establishment, supporting a failed economic system rigged for the wealthy and the corporate elite, they will be rejected – and the fake populists and migrant-baiters of the far right will fill the gap.This moment, ten years on from the crash, can be ours to forge a new economic consensus to replace the broken neoliberal model, which has failed working class people, fuelled inequality and insecurity, and sucked wealth away from the majority to an elite few at the top.On Brexit, Corbyn had this to say.

But others believed the strands became electrostatically charged and in doing so, allowed the spiders to ride Earth’s natural electric fields.In a new study, scientists at Bristol University weigh in on the issue. They report the first tests of whether electrostatic forces are involved in what aficionados call spider “ballooning”. After a series of experiments performed with spiders in a Faraday cage, they conclude that the insects can indeed fly on electric fields.When a spider wants to take flight it typically climbs to the top of a plant, tiptoes around, points its abdomen in the air and rapidly ejects up to a metre of silk. In some species, the insect ejects a number of silk strands that spread out like a fan. Either way, in the blink of an eye, the spider is whisked into the air.To capture spiders to study, Erica Morley, who works on sensory biophysics at Bristol, went to a nearby field and set traps in the form of sticks with upturned bottles on the ends. Back at the lab, she introduced the insects, one by one, to a clear polycarbonate box in a room that doubled as a Faraday cage, meaning it was isolated from the atmospheric electric field.Morley set the box up so she could re-create inside it the kinds of electric fields that are commonly found in nature. On a clear day, the atmosphere’s electric potential might be 120 volts per metre, but it can be tens of times stronger that this when storm clouds gather.When the electric field was off, Morley found that spiders made few attempts to fly off an upright cardboard strip she had put in the middle of the box. But as she ramped up the field, the spiders increasingly took flight. Once aloft, their altitude could then be controlled. “When they take off, you can switch off the electric field and watch them drop, then switch it on and see them rise again,” she said.In further experiments, Morley and Daniel Robert, who studies how organisms sense their environment, bounced laser light off the spiders to reveal how tiny hairs on their legs moved in the presence of electric fields and so helped the insects to detect them. Together, the findings, reported in Current Biology, suggest that while air currents are surely important for ballooning, spiders may exploit electric fields too.Following Darwin’s voyage on HMS Beagle, scientists have recorded spiders flying for hundreds of miles. They can reach staggering altitudes too, according to some accounts. In 1939, PA Glick, an assistant entomologist at the US Department of Agriculture, published a technical bulletin on the distribution of insects, spiders and mites in the air that claimed to find spiders more than two miles up. Beyond flying, the insects can skate, and even sail, on water.While Darwin described the spiders’ aerial excursions to HMS Beagle as “inexplicable”, ballooning undoubtedly helps to disperse the insects. And the sooner they start the better. “Spider egg sacs can contain hundreds of eggs and spiders are cannibalistic, so it’s probably advisable to disperse soon after hatching,” Morley said. “It might not be as reckless as we assume.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7495ad633700c307c5d154531163ae91e4d2abe/0_378_8121_4873/master/8121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c62ec9e9711e4e9ed14270eed1e3225f","title":"a day in the life of a british beach from fishermen at dawn to midnight kisses","story":"On summer weekends, Ramsgate in Kent is packed with holidaymakers.

He enjoys the early-morning shifts. “I love it! It’s the best part of the day!” he says, before he disappears behind the metal gate and along the pontoon. The harbour wall is lined with algae, a joyous, iridescent green.5.50am Outside Cannon’s seafood stall, a car sits with its doors splayed open, a bucket of fish inside. “Half past six, I’ve got to go lobstering!” says Michael Penn. He is busy washing and setting out the bream caught that morning, placing them on the packed ice, next to the prawns and jellied eels.5.54am Anthony, 22, walks past with his dog, Honey. “There’s not that many distractions for her at this time of day,” he says. “And she wakes me up at this time anyway.” Across the street, a man is cleaning the windows of Peter’s Fish Factory – the seafront chippy – using a long pole.6.05am The local Loop bus service has started up. Back outside the Royal, a large truck is collecting the empty bottles. The day is warming and the wind lifting, bringing a briny smell and a golden light across the sands.6.40am On the beach, Martin, 61, has been metal-detecting. “I wish I came out every day, but it’s a couple of times a week,” he says. “It’s a lovely, nice-and-quiet two hours. Someone offered me a cheap metal detector probably 25 years ago – he was hard up, so I bought it. I don’t just do beaches, I’m also in a couple of clubs locally, so I go out at the weekend with them and I record all their finds for the national finds archive – writing them down, weighing and measuring. I’ve found Roman coins, Iron Age coins, medieval stuff. I’ve found bits on the beach I’ve got back to people – jewellery, phones, memory cards …”6.50am Outside Gifts Galore, Derek Rhodes, 72, is putting up flags: Brazil, Wales, a Union Jack. “I’ve had the shop for 20 years,” he says. “It used to be around the corner, but the building started to fall down so I’ve been here for the last five.” He enjoys his days here, right by the beach: “It’s lovely, beautiful friends come every day and have tea – or soup in the winter,” he says. His position opposite Wetherspoon’s has brought a surge in trade. “In November, it was like summertime,” he says. “I’ve never bought so much stock! We’ve sold a lot of England flags lately.”7.28am Two swimmers are out in the waves. One of them – David, 41, a tattooist – emerges slowly from the water and wraps himself in a towel. “I thought I’d be on my own out there,” he says. “My own personal swimming pool! But there’s someone else out there today. I normally go boxing at Golden Gloves, but I do swimming a couple of times a week. It’s beautiful, it’s a good way to clear your head.”8am Down among the boats is Paul, 53, a fisherman. “I’m out at this time most days, taking anglers out on fishing trips. Wait here,” he says, returning with this morning’s daytrippers – including Ian, 50, a carpet-fitter from Rochester, who has headed down here with five friends because they “just fancied a day out fishing”. They are hoping for some skate and will be out for about eight hours. There is a gleam of sun on the green water. “Right! Let’s get fishing!” says Paul. With a heavy clunk of the ropes on the walkway, the boat pulls away softly.8.45am Dawn McIntyre, 55, has just begun her shift, cleaning the showers, toilets and all around the harbour. “They’re generally not too bad,” she says, “because we clean them every day and they have to be immaculate for the mariners who come in. But today … I don’t know if you’ve seen the disabled toilet, but I don’t know what they’ve been doing in there. Holding a foam party, from the looks of things …”8.56am Three men are gathered by the fuel storage of the Thanet Fishermen’s Association, chatting and drinking mugs of tea. Roddy, 59, is delivering fuel – a job he does three or four times a week. “I leave about 4am and pick this up from Essex,” he says of his tanker. “I’ll spend about an hour and a half each time I’m here.” Beside him is Merlin, 49, who runs the fuel company for the commercial vessels. A former fisherman, he took this role when the company began to get busy with the arrival of the wind farm. There are few fishermen out today, he says, “because the weather’s against them. The wind’s a north-easterly we call it a famine wind.” There are days when he misses fishing. “I’ve got to that point where I romanticise it,” he smiles. “I remember the good things.”11.27am Peter’s Fish Factory is bracing itself for the lunchtime rush. Behind the counter, Jamie, 21, is saying how long the queues can run. “In the summer, it’s endless, endless, endless,” he says. Outside, a family of three eat boxes of medium cod and chips, bare-armed and bare-legged – determined, despite the north-easterly, to make the most of the sun.11.45am Michael from Sandwich in Kent is going up in the East Cliff Lift, a listed construction of red brick, with pilasters and architraves and an ornate plaque depicting a dolphin. It carries him up from Harbour Parade to Wellington Crescent. “I’ve never been here before,” he says, as it edges slowly upwards. “I’ve just come for a bit of a stroll. I’ve got nothing else to do.”12.12pm The beach is quiet now. The waves have grown high, bucking against the railings with a soft boom and a flourish of foam.1.14pm At Granville Marina – a parade of houses built partly into chalk cliffs, right by the beach – a couple are cleaning their windows. Jan and John come to their door and explain some of its history: how Ramsgate was the first seaside resort that these houses were once shops for the Granville Hotel on the top. Once, guests would come down Marina Road in their carriages to visit. Their house was home to the coiffeur. “This house has been in the family for 50 years,” says Jan. “It was my aunt’s and she left it to me because I loved it.” They are here semi-permanently now, splitting their time with their home in East Sheen, west London. It is the light they love best. “The sun actually comes up right in front of the window,” says John. “And the light will stay like this till 4pm. And the moon last night was an orange moon.”1.50pm A coachload of Italian schoolchildren arrive for the 2pm tour of the Ramsgate Tunnels – the largest network of civilian wartime tunnels, carved out of the chalk cliffs alongside the beach. Inside, at the cafe counter, two men discuss the merits of the bread pudding.2pm By the ramp to the sands, dressed all in white, is Dave, 77, who moved here last September from Croydon in south London. “People said Ramsgate was beautiful, they said it was out of this world,” he says. “But now it’s just fell to bits. It’s a shame, really. It’s all down to the government. They moved all the rubbish people in and that’s how it’s all deteriorated.”2.06pm At the kiosk on the sands, Jane, 69, and Laura, 19, are selling ice-creams – two Crunchies and a Dream – to three workmen. “We’ve been here about 18 years,” says Jane. “Is that right, Eric?” she calls to her husband, barely visible out the back. “Before that, we were at Dreamland in Margate for 20 years.” Whippy ice-creams are their bestsellers, followed by slush. “We’ve not sold that many today – it’s quiet because of the north-east wind,” she says. Today, they will close about 5pm. Later in the summer, they will stay open as late as 7.30. “It’s not set in stone,” she says. “When the last person comes up for an ice-cream, the shutters come down.”The new Wetherspoon’s along the Parade has changed this stretch of the front. “It doesn’t affect us when it’s sunny, but when it’s cold people who might’ve bought a tea or coffee from us are drawn in there,” she explains. “Quiet times are quieter, is what I’m trying to say. But we get the overflow.”4.25pm From a small cabin on the sands, Tom, a retired firefighter, rents deckchairs and windbreakers and runs a trampoline and a carousel. “I’m here Easter to October and I love it, it’s a great office,” he says. Days like today are not great for business – although it is hot, the wind keeps people away from the shore. “August is the month we make money,” he says. Tom has lived in the area for much of his life. “I was in charge of the fire that burned down all this 20 years ago,” he says, gesturing to the awnings that shield a large stretch of half-begun building work. “It’s the old Pleasurama,” he says. “For the last 15 years, it’s been partially derelict.” He has noticed the demographic changing. “You see a lot of eastern Europeans with a lot of cash to flash around now,” he says. He is looking at buying a place in France. “A watermill outside Limoges, that’s the dream,” he says. “But I’ll need a few good Augusts for that.”4.35pm At a wooden picnic table on the edge of the sand, Emma and Charlotte, both 32, are keeping an eye on their children – they have three each – and catching up on the gossip. They don’t often come down to the beach. “I don’t like the sand – it gets everywhere,” says Emma. “But they love it.” She nods at her children, who are now in the water. “You’d think it would be cheap, but it’s not – I spent £30 on ice-creams, drinks, chips and buckets the other day,” she says.4.52pm Nestling behind a large, striped windbreaker are Annie, 65, Reinhold, 66, Lindsey, 33, Steven, 32, Amy, 10, May, 9, and twins Abby and Katy, 2. They are here as a family, on holiday from Frankfurt. “We love England, we love the beach it’s not too hot and it’s not too cold, there’s a nice breeze and it’s only a seven-hour drive to the ship,” explains Annie, who left Abram in Lancashire for Germany in 1974. When they are not enjoying the beach, they spend their time shopping, “for memorabilia and English things”.5.02pm The sun is still high, but as the day has drawn on and people have finished school and work the beach has grown busier. Pippa, Bethany and Thomas, all 18, and Chloe, 17, are sitting on a step by the sands. They have recently finished their exams and have returned to school today to hand in old textbooks and meet up for a drink. In a few months, they will move away to different cities to start university. “We’re just making the most of the time we have left together, chilling on the beach,” says Pippa.5.35pm A young girl skateboards along the Harbour Arm in shorts and a T-shirt, zig-zagging her way past the fishermen. Meanwhile, in the boot of his car, Potts, 62, lies on a makeshift bed, reading. “I don’t fish, but it’s nice to get out of the house and enjoy life. I chat to everyone – Dutch, Germans, people from all over. I’ll stay and watch the sunset and the people taking pictures.” He pauses and then, unannounced, takes out a didgeridoo and begins playing. “I heard someone playing it once and I liked the sound,” he explains. “One time, when a thick sea mist came down, I started playing and the fishermen over there started wondering what was going on …”7.23pm A gauzy mist has fallen. A man is still fishing off the harbour wall, his daughter crouched at his feet, still in her beachwear, playing Michael Jackson songs on a phone. At this hour, as the light fades, the sky clouds and the fishermen begin to pack up, the gulls’ call sounds more doleful. There are still kite surfers out on the water and children playing on the beach two little girls run across the sand towards the sea line, coats flaring out behind them.7.41pm The day drinkers have moved on now. On the Harbour Parade, the night is revving up. Two bouncers have taken up position outside the Wetherspoon’s at Rokka bar, music spills out on to the pavement.8pm Not far from the harbour sits Lyall, 37, and his dog, Lacey, who live on the streets here. He explains how his other dog, Marley, died three weeks ago. “I used to come down here every Thursday and Friday,” he says. “But when Marley died I was quite depressed.” He has been out of prison for four and a half years, but has struggled to find work and has been homeless for about four months. “There are only about six of us who are actually homeless here,” he says. “The other people are aggressive beggars, heroin addicts, and they bully people.” Yesterday, he was five miles away in Margate. “There’s so many homeless people there sleeping on the beach in tents,” he says. He is on a list for council accommodation, but he does not hold out much hope. “It’s hard with pets,” he says. Not so long ago he was moved along from a spot he had by the waterfall. “Now I sit here because of the cameras, because it’s safe.” Soon, the lighthouse light comes back on, glowing red in the softening night sky.8.40pm Where this afternoon Tom rented deckchairs, a large group of exchange students are now doing the Macarena. When the music fades, Whigfield’s Saturday Night starts up, followed by Lou Bega’s Mambo No 5. Even when the stereo falters, the formation dancing continues. Others play football or leap about on the unattended trampolines. They are here with Churchill House School of English, explains Adwoa Asiedu, 27, one of the group’s activity supervisors. This is a summer job for Asiedu, who is studying for a creative writing MA at Brunel she recently wrote a screenplay called Superstar, “about pursuing your dreams against obstacles”.9.02pm Under the concrete boardwalk are Louise, 20, who works in a nursery, and Matthew, 19, a site supervisor. They are finishing up a barbecue and have spread out a large blanket away from the wind. They look cold, snuggled together in their hoodies. “I was at work and I said let’s go to Aldi and get some bits,” says Louise. “Even though it’s cold, we were like: ‘Let’s brave it! We can take jackets!’”10.03pm The lights have come on in the boats and in the neon of the restaurants along the top of the cliff. Near the harbour office, Philip Louis, 51, a bar manager, is walking home after a night out “pubbing”. Tomorrow, he will take his teenage children to Bruges in Belgium. As he heads off, he points out a fox, pressed against the wall of the Sailors’ Church.11.15pm There is a high, bright moon now. At the Queen’s Head, a cover band is playing Get Lucky. A young couple stands entwined by the shuttered seafood stall, kissing. A car pulling a boat moves quietly out of the harbour and along towards the main road. “You’re not in control!” one girl tells her friend as they sway towards the front. “You gave some mad guy your number!”11.30pm Back at the Royal, Brad the doorman, 24, leans in the doorway checking his phone. “Friday’s always the worst night,” he says. “It’s notoriously quiet. Thursdays are heaving. It’s £1 a pint and last night it was the football.” But even on the busiest nights, he says, there is rarely trouble. “It’s always just a bit boisterous,” he says. “It’s never anything serious.”11.45pm Out to sea is the blinking of lights, the sound of the waves. The back of the lifeguard shelter is lit up by the light of the Wetherspoon’s.12.01am A National Express coach pulls up. A couple make their way down to the pontoon. In Enoteca, a live band is covering the Cranberries’ Zombie as the crowd dances and sings along. “With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns …” the crowd sings. “In your head, in your head, they are crying …”12.09am Two passengers alight from the last Loop bus. The lights go off in its belly and it sails off up the hill, leaving the front to find its morning once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb5aba00ea6973b8c03209b7d49ef1e08764d58/0_304_4385_2630/master/4385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0e06015a980cd7632ce3e149bfe30f","title":"england merlyn india t20 jos buttler","story":"England are expected to fire up the Merlyn spin-bowling machine in the nets at Cardiff on Friday as they search for a method to counter Kuldeep Yadav’s unconventional left-arm wrist spin in their Twenty20 series with India.The message from Jos Buttler, the vice-captain, was not to panic after Tuesday’s opening eight-wicket defeat at Old Trafford, despite a middle-order collapse induced by Kuldeep. The former seamer’s flighted “googlies” claimed five wickets for 24 including Eoin Morgan, Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root in the space of four balls.With such bowlers scarce in England the best option is turn to Merlyn for assistance before Friday’s second game at Sophia Gardens. The technology was introduced in 2005 to replicate Shane Warne before that summer’s Ashes and its inventor, Henry Pryor, claimed it can “bowl any ball known to man”.“Left-arm wrist-spinners seem quite hard to come by,” said Buttler, who top-scored with 69 in Manchester but was Kuldeep’s fifth victim. “One thing we can do is with Merlyn, to replicate the angle. It’s a very good machine to get used to that. But it was the first time some guys have faced Kuldeep and it may take one or two games, plus video.“Old Trafford was one game and it’s Twenty20. We are confident, we will stick to what has served us well, stay true to ourselves and come back hard at them in the next game.”England did not use Merlyn in the build-up to the series and its deployment now would not be viewed as a panacea. The message in the post-match debrief, which took place before the team watched their footballing equivalents the team watched their footballing equivalents win their penalty shoot-out with Colombia, which sparked wild dressing room celebrations, was that batsmen must remain calm and adapt.Buttler, who has faced Kuldeep in the Indian Premier League, said: “He’s a very good bowler. It’s now down to the guys to gain an understanding. You see it a lot in international cricket that guys burst on to the scene and then people get a handle on them.“It’s getting used to the angle as wrist spin is usually right-arm. We know we are a lot better than we showed during that little phase of the game.”India’s victory, sealed by a magnificent unbeaten century from KL Rahul, demonstrated the huge leap in intensity from the six short-form hammerings of Australia, not least given the vocal support for Virat Kohli’s side from the Manchester crowd and the heatwave in the UK that is creating dry surfaces for their spin bowlers.Buttler said: “The pitches will be what they are, so it is down to us to react. We had this in the Champions Trophy last year and in 2013 too. We have to deal with it, counteract that and play in all conditions. That is international cricket.England have confirmed that James Anderson, the leader of their Test attack, will return from a spell spent rehabilitating a chronic shoulder issue in a specially arranged three-day second XI fixture between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire from 15 July.Stuart Broad, another paceman being handled with kid gloves before the Test series with India begins on 1 August, has experienced pain and swelling in his left ankle this summer and visited a specialist on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5d78bb7bee304a02ebd321cb489e6e62ea9a08/238_414_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b45dcf00ed07aec509b9bae0b2a050","title":"lewis hamilton faith perspective f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton knows that risk is part of his business but has revealed that while his passion for Formula One is as strong as ever, he believes it is not worth dying for. As he prepares for this weekend’s British Grand Prix, the four-time world champion also emphasised the importance of his faith and despite the danger inherent in the sport, that: “God has his hand over me”.Hamilton is now in his 12th season in F1 and is expected shortly to confirm an extension to his contract with Mercedes for a further two years. He made his debut in 2007, when he was 22 years old, and took his first title in 2008 for McLaren, scoring three more with Mercedes in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Now one of the most experienced and successful drivers on the grid, he insists his enthusiasm is undiminished but tempered as part of a broader perspective on life.“I love racing,” he said in a podcast released on Wednesday. “I wouldn’t say F1 is worth dying for. Your dream, passion, ambition and goals can be worth dying for.”Hamilton had been greatly moved by a fan who told him she had cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy during his debut season and that his performances inspired her recovery.“It is hard to grasp that and to imagine what she is going through but she grabbed on to something,” he said. “That was maybe this young kid coming from nowhere but facing adversity, somehow fighting through it. That’s definitely worth fighting for, that’s definitely worth dying for, if you can touch one kid and put them on course for their potential.”Hamilton goes into the race at Silverstone, the third leg of F1’s first triple header after France and Austria, after a frustrating meeting at the Red Bull Ring. The Mercedes driver was forced to retire there and his 14-point lead in the world championship became a one-point deficit to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.The 33-year-old has always been open about his Christian faith and believes it plays a major role in his life and his racing. At the Nurburgring in 2007 during qualifying, a wheel nut that had not been located correctly caused his tyre to blow under heavy loading into turn eight at 160mph and his car to spear nose-first into the barrier. It illustrated the danger he knows is a constant companion in F1.“You don’t have time to pray,” he said of such incidents. “Anything can happen any day, but I feel God has his hand over me.” It is a belief strengthened by regular prayer and attendance at church. “I go with a couple of my close friends,” he said. “We meet, we go for breakfast and then we go to church together. We leave most often feeling enlightened and empowered, it’s like a re-centring.”Hamilton has matured as a driver and is at the peak of his powers, which are being put to the test for the second season in a row in a close title fight with Vettel, also a four-time world champion. The pair have exchanged the championship lead five times this year in nine races and intriguingly, drawing on Star Wars, Hamilton believes he is better able to deal with the battle mentally than ever.“My attitude to risk, in a sense it is more controlled, more calculated risk,” he said. “Whereas when I was a kid it was just pure adrenaline and pure balls. I have still got that, but I have also got the mental side. I am stronger in my mind than ever. It is almost like you can relate it to the movie with the force. He has the force within him but doesn’t know how to utilise it. I have the force within me but now I can control it.”That reaching this point has not been easy is well documented but Hamilton was also honest about how much opposition he faced, even as a child. “Parents of other drivers would say: ’You’re not good enough’. Grown adults telling an eight-year-old: ’You just don’t have it.’ It knocked me back,” he said. “I struggled at school, I was dyslexic and I was always behind because I was racing. My headmaster was a complete arsehole. He didn’t agree to me taking time off to race and would put me in detention for the day. I hated school.”Hamilton goes to the British Grand Prix as strong favourite, with the chance to surpass Jim Clark and Alain Prost with his sixth win at the race but is taking nothing for granted. With team errors costing him at three races this season, he sees the travails he has suffered as part of the sport.“Formula One has given me a life, given me a purpose, which is pretty special. But F1 has also broken me. It’s broken me and built me, broken me and built me,” he said. “When you go through it, you put so much into it, it breaks your heart and kills you when you fail, when you stumble, when everyone’s watching when you stumble. But, when you get back up and when you succeed it lifts you up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2bc6799134d65d8a8ca0823857bbf60ca121236/0_159_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff5be81b9c35786c69fee8a708491f8","title":"tour de france 2018 stage by stage guide","story":"This year’s race begins in the Vendée and heads across northern France before turning south to the Alps and the PyrénéesA flat opener, no doubt amid relief that the race is not crossing to the mainland via the tidal causeway of Le Passage du Gois, although with long stretches on exposed coastal roads, if the wind blows the race could splinter as it did in Holland in 2015. Even if that happens, a sprint from a reduced bunch is a near-certainty, and Peter Sagan will be favourite.Another Vendée loop, mainly westwards, with a single fourth-cat climb: another day for Mark Cavendish and company. Time to explain a minor change to the format intended to liven up the the first nine stages as well as time bonuses at the finish, a few seconds are on offer at a sprint close to the finish today’s is 14km out, and should make the finale even more hectic.For the GC men days one and two are about staying upright and in touch. This is the first chance for gaps to open – particularly if it’s breezy or wet – and all eyes will be on Team Sky, who have yet to win a Tour team time trial. It’s not a straightforward blast, peppered with corners and with two little hills after halfway to put any strugglers under pressure. Into the cycling heartland of Brittany for a third sprint day - no wonder the young Australian fastman Caleb Ewan was devastated to be left out. The race should have a more controlled pattern now – breakaway, chase, sprint – where it is to be hoped that Peter Sagan will stay in a straight line avoiding last year’s controversy.Day two in Brittany, and a final 100 kilometres with five climbs, none long but all steep, with the bonus sprint on a further short ascent near the finish. A good day for a break as the finale will be hard to control, or for a sprinter who can climb like Sagan or Arnaud Démare. A classic tense stage when the Tour won’t be won but it could be lost.The longest stage of the race, probably with the wind on the riders’ backs on the rolling roads of Normandy this will be fast and it is destined for a sprint, although if the breeze is north-westerly and teams feel enterprising the race could split up in the finale. One for the usual suspects: Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel, André Greipel and new kid on the block Fernando Gaviria. The fifth flat day out of the first eight let’s hope the sprints haven’t all gone to Marcel Kittel, and that the shenanigans have been relatively restrained. More rolling than the day before, on “French flat”, repeated small climbs and descents which look innocuous on the profile, but take their toll. Again, the wind could make life interesting again, it should be a sprint.Lots of cobbles on a potentially key stage: the final 109km includes 15 pavé sectors, all short, but offering little respite - the longest tarmac stretch is 12km - leaving little chance to regroup after a puncture or crash. Toughest section is Camphin-en-Pévèle at 18km to go. If wet, this could be carnage Geraint Thomas will fancy his chances, but Vincenzo Nibali won the 2014 race on a similar stage. A lengthy transfer to the Alps for more off-roading, two kilometres of unpaved road on the hors-catégorie Col de Glières three other climbs, all first-category, will provide a rude awakening after nine stages on the flat. With a descent to the finish after the brutal double of the Cols de Romme and Colombière, the script is an attack from Romain Bardet, but Chris Froome will have other ideas. Following the recent trend for short mountain stages, this has three major ascents including a summit finish La Rosière is draggy rather than steep, so the main selection will come over the Cormet de Roselend, tackled mid-stage after 38 mainly uphill kilometres. One for a specialist climber with a sprint, so ideal for a Movistar rider such as Mikel Landa or Alejandro Valverde. After two days softening up, a very traditional climbing stage: the Cols de Madeleine and Croix-de-Fer – 25km and 29km long respectively – followed by the Tour’s toughest summit finish, made for Nairo Quintana at his best. With masses of points on offer in the King of the Mountains, someone will take an option on that jersey here with the the overall distilled to half-a-dozen contenders at most.The overall battle will go back on hold for a typical contest between a break and the sprinters teams, depending on what they have in their legs after surviving the Alps. An early climb for the move to take shape, rolling roads in the middle as the route skirts the Vercors, and a flat run-out to the finish. The sprinters teams should handle it but it could be tight. One of the few days when the break is highly likely to stay away, so the tussle to get in it will be intense. The second half of this is brutally hilly, and the steep finish climb up to the airport is made for Julian Alaphilippe, although British fans remember this as where Wirral’s finest Steve Cummings outwitted Romain Bardet and Thibaut Pinot for a tactically perfect win back in 2015. More than a mere transition stage, this includes the first-category Pic de Nore 40km from the finish, after some hilly roads in the Aveyron. Chances are it will see a break succeed, with an elite selection of overall contenders behind them. But these are roads eminently suited to a surprise attack from an all rounder such as Nibali, or Bob Jungels of Quickstep.After the second rest day, the final week opens with a lengthy run in to the Pyrénées and three short steep climbs, the last, the Col du Portillon, just 10km from the finish. The winner should come from the early escape - a climber such as David Gaudu or Pello Bilbao - while the elite group of overall contenders are liable to watch and wait with tomorrow in mind.Uniquely, this short stage will see the favourites “gridded” at the start as the battle for position will be intense with the race heading straight up the Col de Peyresourde, followed by another first-cat, Val Louron, before a summit finish made for Rafal Majka or Nairo Quintana – 2,215m above sea level after a 16km climb. Possibly decisive, it should at least whittle the overall contenders down to two or three.An abrupt transition to flat roads could offer an intriguing ersion from the main plot a similar stage in 2012 witnessed a desperate contest to get in the early break, which fought out the finish. This is the last chance for any non-climbers to try for the stage win – Edvard Boasson Hagen for example – and the sprinters’ teams may not be in sufficient shape to pull a group back.A final day of classic Pyrenean climbing: the triptych of Aspin, Tourmalet, Aubisque – climbed via the little known Col des Bordères – before a descent to the finish. A holding operation before the next day’s time trial for whoever is in yellow, with a break going all the way – someone such as the Pole Rafal Majka for the win – and perhaps a final fight for the King of the Mountains jersey. A time trial, at last, over a distance that would have been termed short in the 1980s or 1990s. Last year, the final contre-la-montre witnessed a fraught battle for the podium, and the same could transpire here. The Basque country course is far from flat, so Chris Froome will start favourite rather than Tom Dumoulin, although the ups and downs will also suit Richie Porte.After another long transfer, the now-traditional evening stage in the heart of Paris, finishing at 7pm, and again using the full circuit around the Arc de Triomphe.

It connects to iOS and Android phones through Bluetooth, and uploads its data to a companion app, also branded UP. But in 2017, after a run of bad financial results, the company liquidated its assets, and earlier this year it disabled the app entirely.That left existing Jawbone Up users unable to carry on using their fitness tracker, sparking hundreds of complaints on social media. But it also pre-emptively broke unsold products, despite the fact that they were still on shelves across the country.Until Which drew attention to it, Selfridges was selling two models of the Jawbone Up2 for £89.99, and Amazon was selling a large selection of devices made by the company. Although they have been removed for sale from the UK site, Amazon’s US branch continues to sell Jawbone devices, including a cut-price version of the UP2 for just $19.97 – a steal, if the device still worked.Amazon UK, Selfridges and Groupon all removed the Jawbone devices from sale after being contacted by Which. Selfridges added that the tracker hadn’t actually been in stock when it was advertised for sale on the site. Jawbone Health, a successor company to Jawbone that bought many of its assets in the liquidation sale, said that Jawbone trackers haven’t been officially distributed or sold in the UK for at least two years.“Retailers have a responsibility to ensure that products listed on websites or sold in stores are fully functional,” said Alex Neill, Which’s managing director of home products and services. “This is especially relevant to products that include a digital component that’s vital to operation, which is typically the case with wearables.“It’s important for all retailers to ensure that suppliers keep them fully informed of any issues that customers might have and take appropriate steps where necessary to ensure that consumers are not inconvenienced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a72cf11beea98c5ac5d424e98197e5f580048e5b/0_262_1978_1187/master/1978.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa6ffea7158dfc272d2cff17c86dc5e5","title":"what should i do about all the gdpr pop ups on websites","story":"Barbara is constantly being interrupted by pop-ups about the new GDPR. Is there anything she can do?Because of GDPR, it feels as though my internet access – my access to information – is now more restricted. I am constantly being interrupted by pop-ups that want me to agree to the website’s privacy policy, use of my data and so on, in order to “personalise my experience”. After recent revelations about unauthorised use of personal data, I’m wary of agreeing without checking what their proposals are, but I often just close the page because there are too many options and it’s too much of a bother. Am I being too paranoid? BarbaraThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) only came into force on 25 May and it will take a while for some websites to adapt. Breaking the rules can result in fines of up to €20m, so at this point, information providers are probably more paranoid than you are.Despite having two years’ warning, some companies were not prepared for GDPR’s arrival. Tronc, a giant American publisher, blocked access to the Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel and many other papers. A message says: “Unfortunately, our website is currently unavailable in most European countries. We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the EU market.”Lee Enterprises, which owns 46 daily newspapers and more than 300 other publications, has taken the same approach. Try to read the Arizona Daily Star and you get an error message that says it is “Unavailable due to legal reasons”. The rubric explains: “We recognise you are attempting to access this website from a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) including the EU which enforces the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and therefore access cannot be granted at this time.” This demonstrates that, thanks to GDPR, your access to information really is being restricted. A few US sites may even decide that compliance costs more than EU residents are worth, but I expect most will become available again soon.Of course, the GDPR does not prevent websites from serving information, including advertisements. Nor does it prevent them from collecting data or using cookies – small text files stored on your devices – if these are needed to provide services. For example, log-in cookies don’t need a notice. Sites only require active consent to use information for other purposes, such as targeted advertising and marketing.Targeted advertising is based on tracking and profiling users. It’s why I see ads for foreign holidays, financial investments and funeral services rather than dating sites, payday loans and job opportunities in the armed services. Websites allow it because advertisers demand it.The European Union\u0027s new stronger, unified data protection laws, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will come into force on 25 May 2018, after more than six years in the making.GDPR will replace the current patchwork of national data protection laws, give data regulators greater powers to fine, make it easier for companies with a one-stop-shop for operating across the whole of the EU, and create a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board.The new laws govern the processing and storage of EU citizens\u0027 data, both that given to and observed by companies about people, whether or not the company has operations in the EU. They state that data protection should be both by design and default in any operation.GDPR will refine and enshrine the right to be forgotten laws as the right to erasure, and give EU citizens the right to data portability, meaning they can take data from one organisation and give it to another. It will also bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed, and ensure that it can be withdrawn at any time.Some websites decided they could comply with the GDPR by removing trackers and the ads they served. USA Today, for example, now provides a “European Union Experience” that “does not collect personally identifiable information or persistent identifiers from, deliver a personalised experience to, or otherwise track or monitor persons reasonably identified as visiting our site from the European Union.”USA Today’s EU site has no ads and no clutter, and it’s very fast. A typical page is roughly 300K instead of 3MB. It shows how nice the web could be without the ads.We’re suffering from a rash of pop-ups because the system is new, but this should be temporary. Once you have selected your preferences, they will be saved in a cookie for future reference. This is an imperfect solution because you will have to repeat the consent procedure for each browser you use, and repeat it again if you have a clean-up and delete all your cookies.The pop-ups are complicated because the GDPR wants specific consent for specific purposes, not blanket acceptances. For example, OneTrust’s consent utility has sections for strictly necessary cookies (needed for the site to work), performance and analytics cookies, functional cookies (for extra services, such as live chat), and targetingmarketing cookies. That’s a good minimum.Fortunately, many sites seem to have adopted off-the-shelf consent utilities and templates rather than writing their own, so you should soon get used to them.One system says “We value your privacy” and offers a choice between “I accept” and “Change consent”. Click to change consent and you’ll get a list of choices (personalisation, measurement etc), but they are all set to “Off”. Simply click the “Save \u0026amp Exit” button and you’ve finished.Another common pop-up thanks you for visiting the site, tells you about data collection and tracking, and offers buttons labelled “Manage your choices” and “Got it, thanks!” In this case, you should choose to manage your choices because they are all tuned on by default. You may want to turn off some of or all the options before clicking “Save and exit”.In some cases, there are too many advertising-related trackers to turn them off inidually. Fortunately, there are ways to use these sites without consenting.The simplest is to read the cache. Google and other search engines may keep copies of pages they have indexed. If so, you can usually read the cached page instead of going to the site.An even better method is to use your browser’s private or incognito mode. Firefox calls it private browsing. In this case, you can accept everything because all the information including cookies from the site is discarded when you close the private browsing window. (You can set many browsers so they always use private browsing.)There are drawbacks. Private browsing modes will not save passwords or keep you logged in, will not add sites to the history section so you can find them again, and will not save anything you type into forms for re-use later.A third way to avoid GDPR pop-ups is to pretend you are not in Europe. You can do this by routing your internet access via a server in a different country, such as the US or Japan.This sounds geeky but it’s actually common. People use anonymous proxy servers to access, for example, Netflix from countries it doesn’t cover. British holiday-makers and ex-pats often use proxy servers to watch BBC iPlayer from outside the UK.For a good description of how proxies work, see Hide Your Real IP Address Behind a Proxy.It’s even more common to use a VPN to protect your data when using public hotspots or wifi in hotels. The VPN encrypts traffic between your computer and its own server so that snoopers can’t read it. Large VPN providers have servers in many different countries, and usually have several in the US. Choose one of those, and sites that derive your location from your IP address will think you are in the US, not in Europe.The drawback is that you will get all the usual cookies stored on your PC, without the opportunity to refuse them. In fact, Ghacks has suggested that Americans could use a VPN with a European server to get the same treatment as EU citizens.The current system is a mess. People end up with thousands of cookies that are hard to manage, even with the help of browser extensions such as EditThisCookie, Cookie AutoDelete and CookieBro for Chrome or others. And while nobody likes tracking, the fact is that targeted advertising is how most users pay for most free websites.But before getting too paranoid, remember that reputable companies are not actually selling your data. That would be giving away the farm. They’re selling the ability to target large groups of people (selected by age, estimated income, family status, homecarother ownership, special interests etc) with adverts that might influence their purchasing decisions.No doubt there are some unscrupulous companies as well. They are the ones that should be caught by the GDPR.Have you got a question?

Rent bikes from Matthias Drasch at Fahrrad-Klinik and pedal off along traffic-free paths beside the Danube. Esterbauer publishes a guide in English for this classic route: maps are excellent, with accommodation listings and places of interest along the way, like Melk and the Austrian vine and fruit growing areas. Fahrrad-Klinik has an arrangement with a hotel on outskirts of Vienna where you leave the bikes. Spend a day or so in Vienna before catching the train back to Linz and flying home.Philip MooreIn AD990 Archbishop Sigeric walked the 1,800km from Canterbury to Rome to collect his pallium (his “stole” of office) from the pope. On the return journey he helpfully recorded his overnight stops – all 80 of them – which form the basis of today’s Via Francigena. Much less well-known than other pilgrimages, like the Camino de Santiago, this route is still taken by more than 1,000 people each year. Cycling it over 20 days is perfectly feasible – I did it in June this year – but be aware it involves crossing the Alps (the 2,469-metre Saint Bernard Pass) and the Apennines (the Passo della Cisa at 1,041 metres). Pilgrim accommodation (€10 a night on average) is sparse in France but much more common in Italy. More information at csj.org.uk.• viefrancigene.orgericonabikeWe did the first section of the EuroVelo 6 route from Orleans to Nantes. We took our bikes over on the car and parked in Nantes using the ZenPark app. We then took a train to Orleans – it has a special bicycle carriage – and started our ride back to Nantes. The route is well-signposted and uses a mix of dedicated cycle paths and minor roads. It works its way along the river and the scenery is stunning. The route is flat but there are worthwhile ersions inland – involving moderate hills – to visit chateaux. There is plenty of good accommodation (B\u0026ampBs, small hotels) along the route: we pre-booked it all online. Nantes is a great place to finish as it has Les Machines de L’Île and the amazing giant mechanical elephant. We covered about 400km over two weeks.  Andrew SpencerThis is a wonderful 440km cycle ride through peaceful countryside and the beautiful walled medieval towns of Nördlingen and Rothenburg ob der Tauber. The route also passes through the larger town of Augsburg. Towards the end of the ride, with the Alps in the distance, there is the amazing scene of Neuschwanstein castle in its mountain. The Europabus coach service offers transport for cyclists and their bikes (reservations advisable), as well as offering short packages for cycling tours. It is, however, easy to organise yourself, as most German train stations have bike hire places, and it is easy to get to the start and from the finish by train. Jennie ParsonsGet the ferry to the Hook of Holland or Rotterdam and pick up the Eurovelo 2 cycle trail, also called the Capitals Route. It takes you across the Netherlands and Germany to Berlin (then on to Moscow if you wish). The route is so well-signposted that you rarely have to look at the map (except to find a campsite or hostel, which are handily marked on the route book, which can be ordered from the website for a donation), and it feels a bit like a treasure hunt looking out for the next signpost. You are taken along small, well-paved paths through forests and rambling countryside, with delicious food and beer and friendly people along the way. It’s long enough to be a real challenge (it took me two weeks) but also flat and smooth enough to not feel overwhelming. Rj HahnThe beauty of cycle touring is that you see amazing things while you are in motion. Watching a landscape shift as you pedal round it is a fantastic feeling, and occasionally you stumble upon a path that makes your heart thump. For me, that was the D25 road from Gospić to Karlobag, in Croatia. It takes you from the leafy interior along 24km of gradual climbing up through a mountain pass. Yes, it is gruelling but, if you stick to bottom gear, put your head down and ride it out, you will be rewarded.After a few hours of solid uphill, the enclosed pass suddenly opens out and you enjoy a calf stretch as you free wheel through the village of Baške Oštarije. You are at the top of the mountain ridge. The road goes into a tunnel and on the other side is an entirely new world. I could see a dozen rocky islands in the glistening Adriatic Sea – the first sea I had seen for 60 days of cycling. To see so far and so unexpectedly, I thought I had jumped into Google Earth.The remainder of the journey was a 1,000-metre descent, full of hairpin bends you only see on car adverts. The main danger was keeping an eye on the road while such an incredible view was in front of me. This journey kept me buzzing for days and is the best afternoon of cycling I have ever had.  Alexander Lewis-JonesOur family cycling holiday around the Amalfi coast was a great way to enjoy the amazing scenery and gave us the flexibility to stop and see loads of beautiful spots both on the coast and in the hills and forests. In fact, most tourists were stuck in cars in traffic jams as we rode past them. For €30 a day we rented excellent bikes from cyclingamalfi – they have a choice of trekkers or e-bikes including locks, helmets, kits and panniers and give advice on routes, too. funinfinlandAt the age of 50, I realised my dream of completing a leg of the famous Giro d’Italia cycle race last spring when I biked from Milan to Sanremo. I hired a bike from Bici Rossignoli in Milan. The 200-mile trip did take me four days at 70 miles a day, stopping off at excellent youth hostels in Genoa then in Finale Ligure on the coast. Coming back, I took advantage of Trenitalia’s take your bike onboard service  from €3.50 a day.  TheCapeCruiser It may not be a long distance for some but the 127 miles from Dieppe to Paris provide a beautiful few days’ cycling. The most famous route is the Avenue Verte, but the best route has been pioneered by Donald Hirsch .The early miles of the route meander through little French villages, over rolling downs and past fields of wheat and corn. The roads are quiet, and there are just enough hills to keep it interesting but not exhausting. Donald’s website contains links to cycle-friendly accommodation.As you near Paris, unlike the Avenue Verte, this route takes you through a series of royal hunting forests to avoid the traffic. After 120 miles of villages, fields, and hunting forests, you enter Parc St Cloud. It’s an area of woodland just after Versailles, traffic-free, long and straight, and bordered by tall trees. Then, you see that the road opens out to a paved area, fountains, and something beyond.Donald’s route takes you to the left, so you never see what’s at the end of the road. But it’s worth cycling on to investigate. You find yourself on a cliff, with all of Paris stretched out in front of you. It will leave you breathless from the view, not the exertion. FrancesValdesIf you’re looking for an introduction to cycle touring (or your partner isn’t as keen as you) the 100-mile Baie de Somme route is the perfect way to explore this underrated region. The cycling is easy throughout and a self-guided route with Belle France (£895pp half-board) is easy to follow with comprehensive maps and notes. We took our own bikes, though bike hire (or even e-bikes) can be included.

The symbol was adopted by England toward the end of the religious wars, in the 13th century, with English ships flying the flag of Genoa as a deterrent to enemies. For the privilege, the English monarch paid an annual tribute to the doge of Genoa, or ruler of the Republic of Genoa. However, the tribute apparently fell by the wayside after the republic collapsed.Marco Bucci, the mayor of Genoa, said the arrears claim could be the “biggest stroke of marketing” for the city. He said he would write to the Queen seeking to recoup funds that could then be spent on the city’s needs.It is highly unlikely Bucci’s idea has any legal grounds, but the matter has been a bone of contention between the two countries for centuries. The St George’s Cross is also used as a symbol in other northern Italian cities, including Bologna, Padua, Reggio Emilia, Mantua, Vercelli, Alessandria and Milan.It is unknown whether St George – who is thought to have been born in the late third century in Cappadocia, now eastern Turkey – ever visited England.

Unaware of the headlines and sympathy their plight had inspired around the world, the 12 boys and their coach assumed the ers were explorers.Adul Sam-on, 14, called out in English to ask the ers what day it was and tell them that he and his friends were hungry. His teammates, unable to follow the conversation, chattered “eat, eat, eat” with the little English they had. Adul assured his friends: “I already told them.”Driven by the revelation that the boys are alive and that a rescue is likely, Thai sports outlets have been working to piece together the dynamics and personalities of the team.The squad’s goalkeeper is Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, who goes by the nickname Bew. Bew has reportedly improved his game over the past few years as a result of his disciplined personality. At the end of each training session, he steps up to collect the team’s equipment. In the cave with Bew is his close friend Pipat Bodhi, 15, whose nickname is Nick. Nick is not a member of the Wild Boars he had joined the team’s practice match on 23 June to spend time with Bew.Prajak Sutham, 14, known as Note, occasionally plays in goal when he is not in midfield. He has been playing football for two years.In defence are Pornchai Kamluang, 16, known as Tee, and Panumas Saengdee, 13, nicknamed Mick. Mick has been described as an ideal defender because of his fitness and fluid movement. However, his coaches have recently considered playing him as a striker because he is strong in the air and skilful with his head. He is said to play as well as a 15-year-old.Also in the cave are two right-wingers: Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, known as Night, and Sompong Jaiwong, 13, or Pong.Duangpetch Promthep, 13, known as Dom, is a forward and team captain. His teammates on the U16 squad say he has the qualities of a leader and a good sense of humour. Dom has been invited to trials by a number of leading provincial teams, including Sukhothai FC and Chiangrai United FC.Playing alongside Dom is Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, or Titan. Titan is the youngest Wild Boars player. He has been playing football for five years. When he joined his school’s sports club three years ago, he was invited to play for the Wild Boars.The third striker in the cave is Nattawut Takamsai, 14, known as Tle.Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, known as Mark, is a trainee. Thailand’s sports daily Siamsport reported that Mark has been playing football since he was in kindergarten and loves the sport so much that he almost always wears a football shirt. His favourite team is Muangthong United, the leading team in the Thai Premier League. He also enjoys swimming and cycling. His mother, Namhom Boonpiam, told Siamsport: “I believe he will survive.”Assistant coach Ekaphol Chantawong, 25, took his squad into the cave on 23 June. He was once ordained as a Buddhist monk, and since leaving the monkhood has spent much of his time caring for his grandmother. Thai news outlets have reported that the authorities have not ruled out charging him with a crime, but Thai government spokesman Lt Gen Werachon Sukondhapatipak told the  that “no one is talking about that”.Wild Boars FC, known in Thai as Moo Pa, was established three years ago as a small, regional club to compete in provincial tournaments. It has under-13, under-16 and under-19 squads, and since members of each squad are trapped in the cave, the entire club has had to sit out of competitive matches.Most of the players are from ethnic minorities and underprivileged communities, and many join when they are eight or nine years old."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3555169.1530795586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plea to anglers to stop fishing due to high temperatures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe State agency said if current weather conditions continue it may consider emergency conservation orders.  Photograph: iStockInland Fisheries Ireland have appealed for anglers to stop fishing until the current period of high temperatures and low water levels comes to an end. The high temperatures mean fish are increasingly stressed and there is less oxygen in the water, posing problems for catch and release angling. The current conditions in many rivers mean fish caught with the intention of being released afterwards, are more likely to die out of the water. On Thursday, Inland Fisheries Ireland called for all salmon angling to be voluntarily suspended during the period of drought. The State agency said if current weather conditions continue it may consider emergency conservation orders. The emergency order would prohibit salmon angling on certain rivers, until the threat to fish health subsided.John Chambers, chair of the Irish Federation of Pike Angling Clubs, said angling competitions across the country had been cancelled due to the weather. “If you catch a pike in this sort of weather, the pike will be much more stressed out, and the chances of it recovering when put back into the water are a lot less,” he explained. Water levels in rivers were much lower than normal due to the lack of rain over the past two weeks, he said. This meant fish were pooling in deeper parts of rivers, and would be easier to catch in large numbers “for those less conservation minded” anglers. The fisheries agency is concerned the low water levels and high temperatures may also lead to fish kills. With pike angling, when a fish is caught the angler may have it out of the water for 10 to 15 minutes, to weight it, or take a picture with it, Mr Chambers explained. In the current weather the fish would be more distressed, and “more likely to die” out of the water, he said. This would apply “across the board” to catch and release angling, he said. Often “keep nets” are set up during competitions, which is a portion of net near the bank of a river where caught fish are kept in the water until the end of the day. Temperatures in the water are hotter near the banks, and Inland Fisheries Ireland have called for the practice to be suspended. Andrew Golden works on Roscrea Fish Farm, Co Tipperary that farms brown trout and rainbow trout. He said the current high temperatures would not affect the farms when it came to hatching fish, which happened once a year around October. “We would have chillers to cool down the water if it was too hot,” when hatching the fish, he said. But the hot weather was having an effect on the current fishery stock, he said. “The fish are very stressed. At the minute we’re not feeding them as much, so they’re not growing as much,” he said. Once the spell of exceptional warm weather and drought passes there should not be any knock on effects for the fish farm, he said.

The Donald don’t get no breaks with these media bums. And Leo knows how he feels. Leo gets it. But he doesn’t appear to get how dangerous the Trump rhetoric is for truth and democracy. The Taoiseach sees hacks hanging around Leinster House in packs looking for stories. Did you ever know the like? As the Donald would say, and Leo concurred on this point over lunch with the happening youth, they aren’t interested in the truth. Although when a politician says a journalist isn’t interested in the truth it’s usually because that politician can’t handle the truth. Earlier this year in the Dáil he accused one newspaper of peddling fake news. It wasn’t. But that doesn’t matter. And in January, in Davos, he revealed his sneaking regard for Trump’s attitude to serious journalism. Anyhow, when news of the latest thrilling episode of Taoiseach on Tour hit town, the Leinster House reporters did their best to appear hugely annoyed. Amid fears tablets would have to be administered to bring down the abnormally high levels of dudgeon among the ranks, Varadkar moved to defuse the situation while his opposition counterparts shamelessly milked it.The Fianna Fáil leader talked about the homelessness crisis, blasting the government for the lack of urgency and delivery in its response to it. He cited the many announcements made about various schemes “and the media was very fair to you” and “they reported you faithfully”. Along the way, he craftily stitched in references to the media and its sympathetic treatment of him.Mary Lou McDonald abandoned any attempt to introduce a masking issue and went straight in with a few haymakers on his reported remarks on the Irish media. “You have confirmed in part these remarks that you are in sympathy with president Donald Trump and that you believe that Irish journalists have no interest in the truth.”For all the things he was saying now about context and the rest she believed “you simply wanted to have a go”.The Taoiseach came prepared with a large page covered in tiny handwritten notes, complete with big inky bullet points and shaky lines drawn around particular sentences.When he got a chance to reply, he said his piece. “I profoundly regret if anyone in the country thinks that in any way that I don’t support a free press or don’t respect the work of journalists.” Cornerstone of democracy, and all that. Although the media is not above reproach or criticism, he stressed. Which is proper order. No, it’s people like Donald Trump, or those who share his views on the media, who want to be beyond reproach. Leo is irked that what he said was leaked. “I’d like to be able to respect the privacy of that event, but obviously that isn’t now possible.” He is annoyed that what he said at the lunch was taken out of context, although people in Leinster House on Tuesday were puzzling over what context Trump’s views on the media might be acceptable.They were also puzzled by his comments about the Irish media trivialising the news and chasing tittle-tattle and gossip. (Some of us have to do it.) Leo seems to find this very distasteful. This amused Micheál Martin hugely. Too many political journalists interested in gossip? “I mean, former taoiseach Enda Kenny would have been very interested in hearing that because he considered you quite notorious in feeding the rumour mill in Leinster House on an ongoing basis with journalists and you weren’t remiss in that regard.”How very true.When we throw in fun runs and gym kits and posing with animals and novelty socks, Leo really finds himself up to his oxters in pot calling the kettle black territory.How did the Taoiseach get himself into such a pickle? For all his media savvy, when meeting a group of media savvy young people, he didn’t think his remarks would get out. The same thing happened Boris Johnson recently, and he’s supposed to be very intelligent too. Above everything, Leo seemed miffed that he was caught out. Of course, we’re all rather hurt now. How could you do this to us, Leo? You know how sensitive we are.Indeed, this has been a most difficult sketch to write. It is practically impossible to type while clutching your pearls and reaching for the smelling salts. I’m off to lie down in a darkened room."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554204.1530731748!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and the media reputation as progressive leader is tarnished","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he profoundly regrets if anyone thinks he does not respect the media after comments he made at a private lunch in New York. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and President Donald Trump at the White House in March: Trump’s attacks on the press have escalted since he became president. Photograph: Win McNameeGetty ImagesFollowing the fatal shooting at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that the United States was the third deadliest country for journalists, behind Afghanistan, and Syria. Newsrooms around the country went on lockdown, and at the National Press Club, one block from the White House, members gathered and mourned.The comments, made to what was reportedly a group of young Irish expatriates working in media, as well as other industries, are particularly striking given the current climate of ongoing attacks against the media in the US.While a reporting fellow with the International Women’s Media Foundation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014 , I underwent hostile environments training, fairly standard for foreign correspondents such as myself working in conflict and post-conflict zones.Trump’s attacks on the press have escalated since he became president, calling out inidual journalists by name at rallies, tweeting vitriol in their direction, and painting all media as “fake news” as a means to undermine often legitimate investigations into his conduct, relationships and ethics.Journalists have been assaulted at rallies by attendees, and security forces. They’ve been arrested while attempting to cover events. They’ve been threatened online and in person with physical harm. They’ve had their credentials revoked, and their access blocked, in a country where press freedom is so enshrined into the constitution that many consider the First Amendment – which guarantees the freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of iniduals to speak freely – the cornerstone of American democracy.In the US, Varadkar is seen largely as the face of a modern, multicultural society. The images of him marching proudly with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau – who immediately and forcefully issued support for journalists and condolences to the victims of the Annapolis shooting – his support of Repeal the Eighth, and his joining the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York City this year with his partner Matt Barrett signaled an Ireland that cares for the rights of its people, and people around the world.That image offers a stark contrast to the current image of the US, where access to reproductive health care is becoming more and more restrictive, the Supreme Court just voted that a baker could deny a gay couple a wedding cake, and harsh immigration policies signal a vision of America\u0026nbspthat is at odds both with our founding, and our current existence.With Varadkar’s comments on the media – and his siding with Trump – that reputation as a progressive, global leader is tarnished. Instead, it appears that Varadkar all too readily adopted the anti-press rhetoric of a reality show executive with a history of manipulating the media now frustrated to discover he can’t edit the ugly bits away in post-production. It might endear Varadkar to the current US administration, but that effect is likely to be short-lived.Varadkar’s bid for the UN Security Council seat comes at a time when Ireland has dropped two places on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index, due to the country’s consolidation of its media companies.If Varadkar truly wants Ireland to take its place at the centre of international peace, security and development, what better way, and in what better time, for him to position Ireland as a leader in championing a free and independent press the world over, where journalists are able to practise without threat of harm or death, from its citizens or its leaders.The opportunity is there, and it’s worth seizing.Molly McCluskey is a former EU correspondent in Ireland and the UK and is now based in the US, where she is a journalist, public speaker, and press freedom advocate.

They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyRSPCA rapped by Charity Commission for allowing chair\u0026#39s daughter to live in £1 million catteryFair game?

But, despite the heat wave temperatures on Wednesday afternoon, the park was empty.Late on Tuesday, Scottish police confirmed that six-year-old Alesha had been murdered and that, as a precaution, told islanders to look out for each other and please look out for your families and the security and safety of your homes.On Wednesday night, police announced that they had arrested a male youth on suspicion of Alesha\u0027s murder. The teenage boy faces further police questioning after his arrest while police repeated a call for information as officers continue their investigation.Anyone who has CCTV at their home or business, or indeed any motorists with dashcam footage which might help with our investigation, are also urged to get in touch, Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said.Alesha\u0027s grandparents Angela King, 46, and Calum MacPhail, 49, live in the Victorian seaside resort Rothesay, in a house that overlooks the Firth of Clyde and out towards the mainland.Its front garden was supposed to be a place where Alesha\u0027s laughter was heard this summer. But instead, the pavement nearby was lined on Wednesday with flowers, cuddly toys and messages. In the middle, her school photo rests next to two pink balloons. A message said: “So, so going to miss you.”Across the road, a pebbly beach was roped off by police tape. A seagull bobbed lazily on clear waters as local resident Bob Mason, 73, looked at the crime scene.“It’s paradise, it’s beautiful,” said Mason, who lived around the corner from the house. “There’s very little crime, I don’t lock my door, most people don’t.On Wednesday night, police had shifted their focus away from the wooded area where Alesha\u0027s body was discovered. A forensics team was seen at the grandparent’s house, where she had been staying along with her father, Rab MacPhail, 25, and his girlfriend when she went missing. Among evidence collected from the property were two cars that were removed over the course of the day.The news shocked the residents of seaside town, which has long been a holiday resort off the west coast of Scotland. Locals commend the tight-knit community and its absence of crime.Tributes and flowers for Alesha left outside her grandparent\u0026#39s house Local councilor Len Scoullar said: “The community is very dismayed and disappointed that such a thing could happen here. We don’t have crime rates that include things like child abuse and murder.”  Alesha had come to Bute for the summer. On Monday morning, at 6:25am, Angela sent out a plea on Facebook asking friends and neighbours to help her find her granddaughter who had gone missing in the night.Two and a half hours later, a neighbour discovered the girl’s body in public woods less than a mile away from the house.Alesha lived on the mainland in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, with her mother, Georgina Lachrane. The 23-year-old discovered her daughter was missing when she saw the Facebook message.Someone tell me what\u0027s happened to my daughter, Lachrane commented. Angela answer me now.Police forensic officers at the house on Ardbeg RoadPolice later brought Lachrane to the island, where she was seen in tears as she laid a tribute to her daughter.Local resident Winnie Watters, 79, said: They\u0027re such a lovely family. The granddad plays bowls and everyone says he\u0027s a great man. I get the bus with the grandma sometimes and she\u0027s lovely too.lt was that little girl\u0027s highlight, coming to see her grandparents in the holidays. I heard from someone that she\u0027d sleepwalked and maybe got lost or fallen, but I don\u0027t know. You hear a lot of rumours.Less than 7,000 people live on Bute, which is home to Mount Stuart House, the stately home where fashion designer Stella McCartney got married. Prince Charles is the Duke of Rothesay.In the centre of town, near the seafront, three young local girls in summer dresses ate ice creams and kicked a balloon.They seemed to have no cares in the world, but the eldest is the same age as Alesha, and was friends with her.Six-year-old Alesha Macphail\u0026#39s body was found in a wooded area by a member of the publicThe girls\u0027 father, who was sitting on a bench keeping an eye on them and did not want to be named, said: It\u0027s terrible. We know the family. It\u0027s hard sleeping at night in case anything happens. I just hope they get who it was. I\u0027ve never seen Rothesay like this, it\u0027s in lockdown. I feel so terrible for the family.Former oil industry caterer Ian Colville, who runs a coffee shop on the seafront and lives near where the schoolgirl was staying, said: There\u0027s a lot of young kids playing out there all the time but for the last three days there have been none at all.At Cafe Zavaroni\u0027s on the seafront, owner Margaret Zavaroni, cousin of the late former Scottish child singing star, Lena Zavaroni, said the town was far quieter than usual.I\u0027ve never heard of anything like this happening on the island. You can let your kids play out all night and if any kids went missing they\u0027d be found in five minutes because everyone knows everyone. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s out of respect but I\u0027ve only had two lots of families with kids in today, normally it would be packed.Police told residents to keep their children safeBute has a faded charm as an old seaside resort and remains popular with daytrippers from nearby Glasgow who still enjoy trips doon the water on the historic Waverley paddle steamer which still goes along the Clyde.The last murder on Bute was 30 years ago, when two paedophiles killed Allison McGarrigle and dumped her body at sea. McGarrigle, whose body has never been found, went missing in 1997 and was declared dead in 2005.  Councillor Scoullar said: “Rothesay has always been the safest place for ladies and children, but that’s been proved wrong.“Let’s hope when the police get to the bottom of this it goes back to the way it has always been.”RSPCA rapped by Charity Commission for allowing chair\u0026#39s daughter to live in £1 million catteryFair game?

An astonishing 24.4 million people watched the match on ITV, the biggest televsion audience since the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.British Airways announced yesterday it was laying on larger aircraft on flights into Moscow and St Petersburg “to make sure as many fans as possible are able to travel”.One flight booking website said it had seen an 83 per cent increase in bookings to Russia in recent days although Kiwi declined to give actual numbers of people flying out. The biggest surge was in fans wanting to travel from Leeds to Russia - a three-fold rise in bookings - which may be linked to the fact that about a quarter of Gareth Southgate’s squad hails from Yorkshire.Russia World Cup in pictures: New puff July 3rdKevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation, said: “Getting the Fan ID is no longer the issue. Fans have posted their tickets on social media and that’s enough to use that to obtain the Fan ID. Supporters have discovered that the Fan ID and purchase of tickets is not linked by an database. They are not connected.“At the moment we are seeing a lot of chatter about getting to Samara. But fans are going to find it hard to get there in time. The price of flights from Moscow have soared as has the cost of accommodation.”England fans have, until now, steered clear of Russia, deterred by the fears of attacks by Russian hooligans and plunging diplomatic relations following the Kremlin-ordered nerve agent attack on the spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in March.Just England 2,000 fans watched the penalty shootout defeat in the Spartak stadium, outnumbered by at least ten-to-one by Colombians. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, has urged more fans to travel to cheer the team on and it is expected that at least 5,000 England fans will make the difficult journey to Samara.  About 10,000 supporters are anticipated to flood into Moscow if England reach the semi-final and the possible showdown with Russia.Fans already in Russia are now delaying their return home. Kieran O’Mara, 20, from east London, said after the Colombia win: “I wasn’t planning on going to Samara but more savings are being transferred and I’m going to stay on. I was saving up for a car but not now.”World Cup 2018 | The best of the \u0026#039s coverageHotels and homeowners have hiked prices in Samara, an industrial city unused to an influx of tourists. Even dingy flats were being advertised for rent at more than £1,000 a night.A two-bedroom flat on Sadovaya street near the downtown area was going for £1,378 on Saturday night despite its garish decor including bright pink floral wallpaper and a cheap sofa covered with a blanket. With no prior reviews on Booking, it appeared to have only recently come on the market.“Villa Chic” on offer outside the city centre was priced at 1,019 a night although it did include .what appeared to be a lapdancing pole in a party room with wall to wall mirrors, sauna and a karaoke machine.The cost of flights out of Samara and back to Moscow have also shot up with one budget airline charging £400 one-way for the one-hour 40 minute flight. Trains are an option but can take 18 hours, which means fans would have to leave Moscow on Friday to make kickoff in Samara the next day.Samara, Russia\u0027s sixth largest city, is an industrial hub of more than a million people located in a bend of the Volga River. The top tourist attraction is a bunker built 120 feet below the ground for Joseph Stalin as the Germans advanced in 1942.The city is known as the centre of the Russian space industry, since the Soyuz rocket, which remains the only way for astronauts to reach the International Space Station, is manufactured there.The British Government has banned ministers, senior officials and members of the Royal family from attending the World Cup following the Skripal poisoning but Labour has suggested shadow ministers could watch England if they wished. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, also called for a national holiday if England won the World Cup.Please review our commenting policyRSPCA rapped by Charity Commission for allowing chair\u0026#39s daughter to live in £1 million catteryFair game?

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “Despite a rocky first six months for the new car market, it’s great to see demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles continue to rise. Given these cars still represent only one in 20 registrations, however, they cannot yet have the impact in driving down overall emissions that conventional vehicles, including diesels, continue to deliver. “Recent government statements acknowledging the importance of petrol and diesel are encouraging. However, we now need a strategy that supports industry investment into next generation technologies and puts motorists back in the driving seat, encouraged to buy the car that best suits their needs - whatever its fuel type.”Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the fall in sales would drag on GDP growth. He also said that while changes to rules around diesel vehicles in April “might have persuaded a few consumers to bring forward purchases”, the drop over the second quarter “likely reflects the still-low level of consumers’ confidence and rising finance costs”.Meanwhile, Ian Gilmartin, head of retail \u0026amp wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said the drop in sales was “no surprise considering the plethora of challenges being faced by sellers”. He added: “The industry has rightly been more vocal in recent weeks, with the lack of clarity around what the playing field will look like for the motor market post-Brexit growing. Patience is running out for both manufacturers and retailers, with all parts of the industry hoping to see some material progress to allow them to plan for the future.\u0026nbsp“As today’s data shows it’s not just a trade issue, with wider questions over diesel policy posing another headache for operators as diesel purchases fell by almost a third in June. The sector has to focus on delivering more environmentally efficient vehicles, but diesel cars have a part to play in this and consumers need reassurance that a diesel purchase is still a sensible move.”The numbers come as Jaguar Land Rover issued a warning that it urgently needs greater certainty on Brexit if it is to continue investing in the UK motor industry. “A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year,” said JLR chief executive Ralf Speth. “As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.”In April, the car maker announced it was cutting 1,000 UK jobs due to Brexit uncertainty and confusion around diesel policy. The SMMT revealed last month that investment in the UK motor industry had halved in the first half of 2018, due to uncertainty about the future post-Brexit.Mr Hawes said: “There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of negotiations. The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

If not, it’s good to keep negotiating,”\u0026nbspthe EUobserver\u0026nbspreported.Asked whether he would countenance extend Article 50 talks, he said: “We’ll see.”Austria took up the rotating presidency of the European Council this week following a summit on Friday, and will hold the role\u0026nbspduring the crucial autumn period during which both the EU and UK have said they want to sign a deal.Extending Article 50 talks would require the UK to ask for an extension and all 27 EU member states to agree to one.

Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “Despite a rocky first six months for the new car market, it’s great to see demand for alternatively fuelled vehicles continue to rise. Given these cars still represent only one in 20 registrations, however, they cannot yet have the impact in driving down overall emissions that conventional vehicles, including diesels, continue to deliver. “Recent government statements acknowledging the importance of petrol and diesel are encouraging. However, we now need a strategy that supports industry investment into next generation technologies and puts motorists back in the driving seat, encouraged to buy the car that best suits their needs - whatever its fuel type.”Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the fall in sales would drag on GDP growth. He also said that while changes to rules around diesel vehicles in April “might have persuaded a few consumers to bring forward purchases”, the drop over the second quarter “likely reflects the still-low level of consumers’ confidence and rising finance costs”.Meanwhile, Ian Gilmartin, head of retail \u0026amp wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said the drop in sales was “no surprise considering the plethora of challenges being faced by sellers”. He added: “The industry has rightly been more vocal in recent weeks, with the lack of clarity around what the playing field will look like for the motor market post-Brexit growing. Patience is running out for both manufacturers and retailers, with all parts of the industry hoping to see some material progress to allow them to plan for the future.\u0026nbsp“As today’s data shows it’s not just a trade issue, with wider questions over diesel policy posing another headache for operators as diesel purchases fell by almost a third in June. The sector has to focus on delivering more environmentally efficient vehicles, but diesel cars have a part to play in this and consumers need reassurance that a diesel purchase is still a sensible move.”The numbers come as Jaguar Land Rover issued a warning that it urgently needs greater certainty on Brexit if it is to continue investing in the UK motor industry. “A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year,” said JLR chief executive Ralf Speth. “As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.”In April, the car maker announced it was cutting 1,000 UK jobs due to Brexit uncertainty and confusion around diesel policy. The SMMT revealed last month that investment in the UK motor industry had halved in the first half of 2018, due to uncertainty about the future post-Brexit.Mr Hawes said: “There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of negotiations. The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.)

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will stand trial next April.Prosecutor Simon Davis said: The defendant and [Rogers son] Kevin Curry effectively dumped Roger Curry in Hereford city centre knowing full well they just left him there.The motive was to put him into care - its known as granny dumping.Having left Roger Curry there, the defendant made contact with the police. His story was all lies, about having found this person.Mr Hayes was granted bail on the condition he notifies police if he plans to leave the country for any period.Mr Curry was cared for at a nursing home in Credenhill, Hereford, for eight months before being flown back to Los Angeles.Police spent months trying to work out who he was, despite contacting local care homes, hospitals and even international embassies.Mr Curry appeared to have been cared for and was found wearing new clothes.He lived in a care home run by Herefordshire Council but was eventually identified after a viewer responded to a police appeal on BBC Midlands Today.Debbie Cocker found an old picture from a 1958 yearbook for Edmonds High School in Washington State which appeared to show Mr Curry in his younger days.Mr Curry was then tracked down by investigators to a burnt-out house following a fire at his home in 2014 in a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles.Neighbours identified the mystery man as Mr Curry, a former nurse married with two children.In a BBC Panorama documentary, his son Kevin said he had nothing to do with the abandonment of his dad."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418185867.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chile miner mario sepulveda help thai cave boys","story":"Mario Sepulveda - nicknamed Super Mario by fellow captive miners for his indomitable spirit - was among the 33 stuck 2,300ft underground after a mine collapse in San Jose, Chile in 2010.The group were later pulled alive from the mine in a specially constructed capsule one-by-one, and their astonishing tale of survival was made into a film.Today he told The Sun Online the boys needed to remain calm, stay good humoured and dont get too down.He said: I am planning on going there myself, so I can provide help and support, especially so I can be with their families and encourage them with my own experience.I think it would be really important. I am already looking at buying the plane tickets, I want to be there to help and it would be great if other miners could come with me too, because we all went through the same situation.I am determined to go and find the money to pay for the journey. It’s difficult for me economically, but I’ve done so many other things in my life and so I believe I will achieve this too.The 12 Thai boys - aged between 11 and 16 - and their 25-year-old football coach went missing while visiting the cave network on June 23.Although rescuers feared the worst, British cave divers called in to help found them alive on a dry bank inside the cave earlier this week.The groups plight has captured the worlds attention as authorities now try to find a way to get them out of the caves as soon as possible.There is the possibility they may remain stuck for three months until monsoon season ends and water levels blocking their exit drop, or they may be taught to dive and escorted out by Navy SEALs.Mario added: The children must be feeling desperation, anguish, and there will be moments when they will enter into panic, thinking that they will be abandoned there to die.For this reason I think that it’s very important that someone in the group stays positive, and that role needs to be done by the coach, as he is the only adult there.In my experience, the qualities which kept us alive and positive was a sense of humour, working together in a team, resilience, humility and much faith in God.The most important thing, though, is good humour, that really helps you keep going and tolerate the situation.This situation has made me relive our experiences, and I have felt again the anguish of being trapped underground.In fact every time that I hear of a situation like this happening it fills me with great anguish. It saddens me that this situation could have been avoided.What most worries me, as I have followed the story on TV and newspapers, is the humidity and the cold in the cave, as well as the hunger the children must be feeling.Those boys must be missing their families terribly, they must be missing the shelter and warmth of their homes and their parents.I hope that good comes out of it and that when they come out they will value their families much more than before, just like we did.My advice to the families of these boys is to stay united, respect each other, be very patient, and never stop believing that they will see their sons very soon.They also need to know that once this is over they and their children will be at the centre of the spotlight, they need to prepare themselves for this and find people to advise them well.As happened to us, there will be people trying to fool them with false promises, they will need to keep their feet on the ground and protect their children before anything else.I remember how much my family suffered when I was down there, so I imagine just what the families of these children are going through, they must be so worried and desperate.For this reason the most important thing is for the authorities to be constantly communicating with the families, because when there is little communication they begin to enter into a great feeling of distress and anguish."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418087664.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"school bans suncream hyde park plymouth uk heatwave","story":"Hyde Park Infant School in Plymouth, Devon, sent a newsletter to parents letting them know pupils were not allowed to bring sun cream into school.It instead urged parents to use “once a day” lotion on their kids – despite Cancer Research UK advising people to re-apply cream regularly.Former RAF office Mark Jones claims his eldest daughter Poppy, seven, was told to put away her sun cream when she got it out at lunchtime.Mark, 41, also dad to five-year-old pupil Alice, said the “ridiculous” and “bonkers” decision is putting kids at risk of sunburn as temperatures soar.Hyde Park Infant School have put the ban down to concerns over the chemicals in sun cream and its storage.The Royal Navy Reserves officer, from Plymouth, said: It’s absolutely bonkers that the girls can’t take sun cream into school.“Lots of sun creams rub off easily onto the kid’s uniforms which means when they go out at lunch time they’re no longer protected.“These ‘once-a-day’ creams haven’t been proven to work and even the Cancer Research UK website says that cream must be re-applied regularly in order to maintain adequate protection.”Mark has now set up a petition calling on the school’s board of governors and head teacher to change their minds.He claims when wife Nicola 39, contacted Elizabeth Hill, the school’s headteacher, she was told there were concerns over the chemicals contained in the cream which could potentially cause harm.Taking his concerns to the board of governors, Mark claims he was later informed the reason the sun cream wasn’t allowed in school was due to storage space.Mark is also confused Hyde Park Junior School – which sits on the same campus and has the same board of governors – does allow its pupils to bring in sunscreen.Newsletters on Hyde Park Infant School’s website state: “Please apply sun cream to exposed parts of your child’s body that will last the day.“Please apply any sun cream before school as it cannot be applied in school or brought to school.”Mark said: “The fact that the head teacher and the board of governors couldn’t give me the same reason just didn’t add up.“They couldn’t provide a plausible reason for not allowing cream in the classroom.“I understand that they have rules about not being allowed to apply sun cream to pupils because of safeguarding, but I want my children to be able to apply it to themselves, so why can’t they do this?”Mark has since made an official complaint and his petition has already been signed more than 100 times.In a statement, head teacher Ms Hill said: “Mr Jones has made an official complaint to the school which is at ‘stage 3’.“I am unable to make a comment during this process.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418096973.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eating a handful of nuts a day significantly improves fertility

Do you be extremely reasonable and adjust, or do you face down the EU?“They will come to us eventually, we just need to hold our nerve.”At the same time, Mrs May mounted her own battle against time to try to persuade senior Cabinet ministers to side with her during a make or break Cabinet showdown at Chequers tomorrow.The PM called in Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson yesterday afternoon – seen as two key swing votes around her bitterly divided top table.She argued that her plan to align with Brussels rules on goods and collect EU customs tariffs in order to keep borders with Europe free flowing will only affect 4% of all UK trade, and crucially not stop Britain from pursuing an independent trade policy after Brexit.Mr Davis was coordinating a “ring round” of Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers to make sure they were “all on the same page”.An ally said the ministers would “be ready at Chequers to show very simply where promises made in the PM’s speeches were crossed by the new proposals”.The New Customs Partnership which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU was rejected outright by Brexiteers in the Cabinet.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.The Brexit Secretary is working closely with Boris Johnson, with both confident that Mr Javid was also still opposed to collecting customs on behalf of the EU – a new system dubbed the Facilitated Customs Arrangement.Ardent backbench Leaver Andrea Jenkyns called on the Brexiteer Cabinet ministers to “show their steel” and block the blueprint, as she ominously warned that Mrs May could be ousted, saying: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs who keep their promises”.Jacob Rees-Mogg led an angry deputation of 40 anti-EU Tory MPs from the eurosceptic European Reform Group to protest at Chief Whip Julian Smith yesterday morning.Mr Smith was told during the stormy meeting that the Tories will be “toast if we welch on Brexit”. Former Leave campaign boss Michael Gove insisted it was for the full Cabinet to decide whether her plan will go forward, in a veiled hint they could overrule the PM.The Environment Secretary – who angrily ripped up a paper on her customs plan in No10 last week – would also not rule out Cabinet resignations, equivocally saying only when he was asked: “I don’t think so”.Another minister predicted there would be resignations after the day-long Chequers showdown.The former Remain backing minister told The Sun: “The time has come to chose.“She cannot take everyone with her any more, so someone is going to walk”.As tensions spiralled on all sides of the Tory party, Business Minister Richard Harrington insisted that no deal “would be completely disastrous for business” – deviating from the Government’s line.Ministers such as Boris and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who attack firms for going public with their worries “don’t really understand how business works,” Mr Harrington added.GOT a story?

Now he may have saved these kids’ lives.“The funny thing is that at first the authorities didn’t want to pay attention to him.“But Vern convinced them and now they consider him as some kind of magician.”The practice is common in Thailand to bring good luck on occasions such as New Year.Pilgrims to the site in Chiang Rai province also took fruit and flowers.In a picture posted on Twitter, Thai navy divers could be seen taking a garland of banana leaves to the cave.Thailand is a famously superstitious country.Getting a hair cut on a Wednesday is considered bad luck, while bees and toads are good omens.The No 9 is lucky, but Thais are said to be reconsidering the superstition against the No 13, with 12 boys and their coach stuck in the cave.GOT a story?

An Italian member of crew rang to alert us.The body was on the floor. The cabin was single, she slept there alone and very small as they are on boats. Her suitcases were on the floor as though she were rearranging things.She may have hit her head on the door of the cabin or while getting her suitcase down. These cabins are very constrained.He added: There was no blood and no traces of violence or other people. It seems as if no one else was on board when she died.There was no alcohol visible in the room. The autopsy has to be done still but it looks like an accident. The boat must stay in port while some checks are made but will probably not be seized.The Maltese-registered La Polonia had arrived at the Italian Riviera port of Imperia last week and was undergoing a changeover ahead of a new arrival.Rebecca, from Notting Hill, west London, had only joined the yacht last week after being hired from a Monaco-based crewing company.Crew members from La Polonia had watched the match with deck hands from a neighbouring yacht called Dynamic in a bar and Rebecca had joined them later to celebrate the win.Local reports said that when the group returned they had jumped into the hot tub on the La Polonia and carried on partying but after a while Rebecca was said to have gone back to her cabin the worse for wear.Crew members raised the alarm yesterday morning when she failed to turn up for breakfast and found her lifeless in her cabin.Police and paramedics were called to the scene but she was declared dead and TV news reports showed her body being taken away in a private ambulance.Matteo Andracco, the lawyer representing the boats owners told The Sun Online: It seems that after the England match she went for a few drinks in town and met up with the crew of another boat, the Dynamic, which was moored next to their boat.There were only the crew staying on board, not the owners, about five members of crew. They were all in bed at the time when she died.The chief engineer heard her alarm go off about 6.30am. After a few minutes when she didnt turn it off he went in and saw she was not moving, so they called an ambulance.In her room there were two levels, a lower level with the bed and an upper level with a small bathroom. It seems likely she fell down the five or six steps between the levels. So far nobody is under investigation. Police believe it was just an unlucky accident.La Polonia can accommodate 10 guests and seven crew, and costs £150,000 a week to charter.Meanwhile, horrified neighbours of Rebecca today paid tribute to the told of their shock at her tragic death.One said: Thats such a shock. I would see her quite a bit and shed always say hello.Shed make an effort to go out of her way and say hello and have a chat. You could tell she was a genuinely nice person.She seemed quite reserved and maybe even shy, so its surprising that she did that kind of job. But I guess you dont know until you know someone better.She added: I wish Id made more of an effort to speak to her because you could tell she was a good person.Another, called Chris, told The Sun Online: She never caused any trouble here. She kept herself to herself, but always said hello to me and my kids.Me and my ex didnt know much about her, didnt know what she did or anything. Wed just say hello when passing, its kind of like that round here.The only other person that came to visit was her mum.He added: Its genuinely shocking to hear, she was so young. Its always the nice ones it happens to. I hope for the family gets this sorted out soon."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417877080.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"all time heat records

sweating it out.Residents in Quriyat, Oman, endured the highest sustained temperature in a 24-hour period at the end of last month with a minimum temperature of 42.6C.Temperatures in Ahvaz, Iran, hit 54C this week, the highest the country has ever experienced.Yerevan, in Russia saw the mercury reach 42C.And North America is also suffering with Ottawa in Canada peaking at 47C and Montreal recording a new high temperature of 36.6C.Denver in the US managed 40.6C – equally the city’s highest ever recorded temperature.Britain has also seen its temperature records being smashed.Motherwell recorded Scotland’s highest ever temperature last week with the thermometer reaching 33.2C.Glasgow saw temperatures peaking at 31.9C, which melted the “weatherproof” material on the roof of its Science Centre.Belfast also recorded a new record high of 29.5C.Public Health England (PHE) has issued a level two health warning over the unusual heat.It said: “Temperatures are expected to temporarily reduce a little night and day through the middle of this week, before lighter winds allow higher temperatures across more eastern areas of England during Thursday and to some extent during Friday.“This alert has been issued for the maximum duration possible.“It is very likely to be extended for similar areas later this working week as heat is expected to build towards the weekend and possibly during the following week.“Even in areas that do not breach their alert criteria, the headline is that it is expected to remain largely dry, often sunny and very warm at times.”Weather forecasters expect the current heatwave in Britain to at least match the temperatures of 1976 when temperatures topped 28C for 16 consecutive days.Meteorologist Emma Salter said: “The long-range trend is for above-average temperatures staying until the end of July.”Experts believe global warming and the weather pattern known as El Nino are behind the temperature surge.Jennifer Marlon, of Yale University, said: We know that these kinds of events are very consistent with what we expect to be happening with climate change.The current heatwave in the northern hemisphere is also being caused by El Nino, where sea surface temperatures rise in the tropical Pacific – an event that occurs every three to five years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004180758431.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather heatwave longest hotspell britain 42

consecutive days of scorching hot weather led to the worst drought in 150 years.Meteorologist Emma Slater told The Times: The long-range trend is for above average temperatures staying until the end of July.Temperature records are being broken worldwide during the current heatwave sweeping from North America across Europe and Asia.A world record highest sustained temperature was recorded in Quriyat, Oman, at the end of June — where locals had to cope with a minimum of 42.6C over 24hrs.Meanwhile, 47C was recorded in Ottowa, Canada this week, while residents in Ahvaz, Iran hit a record 54C.In the UK, record temperatures were recorded in Belfast (29.5C) and Glasgow (31.9C) — where the weatherproof roof of the citys Science Centre melted in the heat.Heavy rain and showers today will only briefly intrude on the summer scorcher.Up to 20mm is expected to fall in the south east — but the stormy weather is set to clear for Super Saturday as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter finals.It will also be the first weekend of Wimbledon and the London Pride march — with pub industry insiders predicting an extra eight million pints will be sold as Brits flock to beer gardens.A hosepipe ban was activated in Northern Ireland on June 29 and restrictions in England, Wales and Scotland are expected to follow.Anyone caught using a hosepipe could end up in court and be given a £1,000 fine.However, it seems homeowners are ignoring the pleas from water firms as sales of sprinklers at Wickes have rocketed by 600 per cent, the Daily Star reports.Sales of the Hozelock part which attaches to garden hoses have also gone up by 135 per cent.A Wickes spokesman said: “To see demand for sprinklers increase so significantly in the last four weeks suggests customers are opting to use a sprinkler while simultaneously enjoying all that summer has to offer.”Overall temperatures will be around 82F (28C) for the 11th consecutive day today.This is expected to trigger some torrential downpours and thunderstorms — a jarring end to several days of a 30C-plus heatwave.Parts of the south west including Dorset have already had a washout — and more southeasterly areas will see the rainfall today.But the showers will clear quickly as the we approach the weekend when sunny skies and high temperatures will take hold once again.Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: “These downpours are actually part of the heatwave.“All signs suggest that it is going to carry on until the end of the month and possibly beyond.”Some patchy cloud will be the only spoiler on an otherwise sunny 30C day on Friday in the south — with an even warmer picture in store for a day of sport on Saturday.The highest temperature is expected to be recorded in the London area on Saturday with 31C or 32C forecast.Elsewhere it will stay largely dry and warm on Friday and Saturday across the UK.Light drizzle is expected to affect northwestern parts at times over the weekend but it will mainly be a sunny picture across the country.Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell told The Sun Online: Today many places will still be warm and sunny, but with a slightly fresher feel in the north west.There is a risk of rain with some heavy and thundery showers in southern England this afternoon and into the evening, while it remains largely dry elsewhere.Into the weekend, an area of high pressure will move in bringing dry weather with sunshine for most places.There could be some cloudy patches in northern and northwestern areas but otherwise it will be a clear.On Saturday the highest temperature could be 31C or higher in the London area."},{"url":null,"title":"argument dog owner pet tied up heat who is wrong","story":"The pooch was left for ten minutes on a scorching pavement that

dog?”He decided to stay with the dog until his owner collected him to ensure that he was OK.He says: “I thought the situation was disgusting.“How could someone leave a defenceless animal who can’t speak for itself tied to a lamppost in the midday sun?”Andrew wants people to be more aware of the dangers the current UK heatwave could have on their pets.He said: “Owners need to know what their pets can withstand in regards to the sun.“It seems as there’s a lot of people disregarding the animal welfare act and we have a duty of care to help any animal in any need.”According to Pets4Homes, a pavement temperature of over 50 degrees is hot enough to burn dog’s paws in just a couple of minutes.The RSPCA advises people to call the police on 999 if they see a trapped dog displaying signs of heatstroke — which includes heavy panting, dark gums and tongue, and vomiting.If possible they should give it cool but not cold water, pouring some over its body to bring its temperature down

hand-feeds the babies every two hours for up to three weeks until they develop teeth and can be set free in the wild.Youngsters are particularly vulnerable in the dry conditions, which it is feared could be devastating for the already declining British hedgehog population.Some homeowners have reportedly found hedgehogs struggling in ponds and swimming pools after apparently falling in while trying to drink.Gillian said: We are getting baby hedgehogs handed in during the last week or so that are dehydrated because theres no water for them.Weve had 27 handed in over three days and thats just what we know about.There will be others that are dying of thirst.People need to put out dishes of water that are shallow enough to drink from without them falling in and drowning.Gardeners should also be careful when trimming bushes or burning rubbish so they dont disturb hedgehog nests, she added.The UK population of hedgehogs are thought to have plummeted below a million, 30 per cent down

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church still holds remarkable sway over its worshippers.Research carried out by Edinburgh University in November 2017 found there had been a rise in public exorcisms in recent years.Belief in the notion of the evil eye – or buda – is widespread in the country where people are said to be empowered by an evil spirit, often with the ability to change into a hyena."},{"url":null,"title":"california couple bathroom hidden message reddit shineski","story":"Alex and Jessica Monney were carrying out building work in their home in San Jose, California, when they found a hilarious note from the house’s former occupants.The message read: “Hi!

Visitors must leave by 25 July.To order one you must hold a match ticket, even if you don\u0027t actually intend on attending the game. The UK Foreign Office told Sky News that the process of applying for a Fan ID once a match ticket has been purchased is quick and an electronic version is suitable to travel on. A physical version can be picked up in Russia.Travellers also must have a passport valid for the duration of their trip.The Foreign Office website advises that if travelling on a British passport issued since January 2017, it must be signed with a black pen before anyone travels as some British nationals who haven\u0027t signed theirs have been denied entry into Russia.But the whole package is unlikely to be cheap. Some websites were claiming to offer tickets to the match in Samara, but the conditions varied enormously, with some only available to purchasers outside the UK and most going for several hundred pounds.I\u0027ve got my documents, how do I get there?One of the fastest options for those coming from London is to take the Thursday 6.05pm flight (UK time) from Heathrow. With a connection in Helsinki, you\u0027ll land in Samara\u0027s most convenient airport, Kurumoch, at 3.15am (local time). The flight, which lasts just over six hours, will set you back around \u0026#163665.A cheaper option, at around \u0026#163460, is to fly from Gatwick at 10.35am (UK time), wait almost four hours in Istanbul before landing in Samara at 12.45am (local time).If you\u0027re flying from Manchester, a quick option is to catch the 5.50pm from Manchester airport where you\u0027ll connect up with those flying from London to take the plane from Helsinki to Samara which lands at 3.15am (local time). It\u0027ll set you back around \u0026#163665. I don\u0027t want to fly, how else can I get there?Sorry, you\u0027ve left it too late. The drive from London takes an estimated 46 hours and needs you to cover almost 2,500 miles (4,000km). This means to get there in time for the game, you would have needed to leave Thursday morning and drive constantly without stopping.What if I want to be situated in Moscow?The distance between Moscow and Samara is around 650 miles (1,050km) with an approximate travel time of 75 minutes by plane or 15 hours by train. The Samara Arena is nine miles (15km) from the city centre. Kurumoch airport is less than an hour\u0027s drive from the town centre.Will there be anywhere for me to stay?Samara is Russia\u0027s ninth biggest city and is situated on the banks of the Volga River. It\u0027s the centre for Russia\u0027s aerospace industry, and has a population of more than one million people.However, the tourism sector is less developed than in other host cities, and as such there are limited accommodation options so it is advised to book somewhere before you arrive.Do I need to speak Russian to get around?The fan zones are equipped to deal with English speakers. A few phrases which may prove useful to know are:One - \"adin\" Two - \"dva\"Three - \"tri\"Thank you - \"spasiba\"Hello - \"zdrastvuite\"Bye - \"da svidania\"Please - \"pazhalusta\"What is your name? - \"kak vas zovut?\"My name is\u0026#8230 - \"menya zovut\u0026#8230\"Entrance/exit - \"vkhod/vykhod\"Please help me - \"pazhalusta pomogite mne\"Bus - \"avtobus\"Train - \"poezd\" - \"metro\"Police - \"politsiya\"I don\u0027t speak Russian - \"Ya ne gavaryu pa-russki\""},{"url":null,"title":"70 vital facts show power","story":"News70 vital facts that show the power of the NHS on its 70th birthdayDespite huge challenges, it remains a national institution.

It faces huge challenges thanks to an ageing population, expensive drugs, and budget pressures. But despite it all, it has remained a national institution - employing well over a million people across the country. And it\u0027s an inspiration to health system\u0027s across the world. To mark this milestone, here are 70 notable facts that show the enduring power of the NHS.   1 The Commonwealth Fund rates it as the best healthcare system above France, Germany, and USA.   2 It ranks the NHS as best for safe care, affordability and equity.   3 The NHS is the world’s fifth largest employer behind the US Department of Defense, the People’s Liberation Army in China, Walmart and McDonald’s.   4 It directly employs 1.3million people in England and Wales.   5 That does not include 159,000 temporary staff, 42,000 GPs, 24,000 dentists, and 12,000 opticians who also work for it.   6 The NHS was conceived by Labour minister Aneurin Bevan and launched on July 5, 1948.   7 Sylvia Beckingham, then 13, was the first NHS patient at Park Hospital in Manchester.   8 The first NHS baby Aneira Thomas was born at Amman Valley Hospital in Wales just after midnight.

The Work and Pensions Secretary brushed aside the call today as MPs summoned her to explain misleading statements about Universal Credit.  Ms McVey was forced to apologise after the National Audit Office criticised her use of facts in a damning open letter.  She insisted she only inadvertently misled MPs about a report by the NAO on her flagship benefits shake-up. But Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said today: How can these statements be inadvertent slips of the tongue? Labour MP Ms Greenwood said the Cabinet minister had either deliberately misrepresented the NAO report - or was incompetent by not reading it properly.  Ms Greenwood told the House of Commons: If she misread this report so badly this brings in to question her competence and her judgment. If she did read the report and chose to misrepresent its findings, she has clearly broken the ministerial code. Either way, she should resign. The row erupted after Ms McVey disowned a report by the National Audit Office that warned the six-in-one benefit was poor value for money and forcing people to food banks.  Ms McVey claimed the damning report was out of date. But in an unprecedented open letter, respected NAO chief Sir Amyas Morse said there was “no evidence” of this. He accused the Cabinet minister of misrepresenting his report, branded her behaviour odd and suggested she has refused to meet him. Crucially, he added her claim that Universal Credit is working has not been proven. Ms McVey apologised to parliament yesterday - for only one of three “unproven” statements highlighted by the NAO. She told MPs: “I mistakenly said the NAO had asked for the rollout of Universal Credit to continue at a faster rate and be speeded up. In fact the NAO did not say that and I want to apologise.

The game - which sees people playing as individuals or teams trying to become the last survivors on an island - has become a global phenomenon, with the most popular Battle Royale version downloaded more than 40 million times.  But it has also caused concern because of the amount of time that young boys are spending playing the 12-rated game, reports NottinghamshireLive .  Zoe Godber, 47, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, said her nine-year-old son Jacob started playing Fortnite about six months ago.  Before this game came along, he was fine. He was playing Roadblock [an online puzzle game] before that, then all of a sudden Fortnite popped up and that was it. Nothing else mattered. She said that Jacob usually starts his day watching a YouTube video of Fortnite gameplay, and then when he got home he was usually on the game itself from 4pm to 10pm, or sometimes 9pm. Even if he\u0027s not on the game, he\u0027s watching YouTube videos about it. He doesn\u0027t watch telly downstairs with us anymore. We don\u0027t see him, and that upsets us. But if I didn\u0027t let him on it, he\u0027d kick off. He\u0027d have a fit on the floor, and scream and swear at me. He\u0027s run off and I\u0027ve had to go and find him.  She said her husband Jamie, 40, a postman, was less of a soft touch than she was, and would stop Jacob playing at 9pm. She also said her ten-year-old daughter Layla plays the game without any of the same issues. But on one occasion Jacob actually smashed his TV screen after failing to win a game. He was getting really agitated, said Zoe, a bartender at the Nag\u0027s Head in Sutton-in-Ashfield. Layla came down and said Jacob had broken the telly. He had taken his controller and smashed the screen. He didn\u0027t play on Fortnite for a few days [after that], but it was a nightmare. He was crying, and being naughty at school. She let him play again, and he now has a new TV in his room. She said that Jacob had previously not been eating properly because he was on the game, but she now made sure he came down to have his dinner. However, she added: I feel like I can\u0027t get him to be normal with the game. He\u0027s got loads of toys under his bed, but he\u0027s not touched them since Christmas. I\u0027m not looking forward to the summer holidays.  Dr Mark Griffiths, Distinguished Professor of Behavioural Addiction and Director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, said that Fortnite was not especially addictive. People who have a genuine gaming disorder or addiction tend to play role-playing games, where they play for 10 or 12 hours a day and then the game carries on without them, he said. Fortnite is short 20-minute games. It does have a very \u0027more-ish\u0027 quality, because you get rid of your frustration [at losing] by playing another game, but it\u0027s actually a very social and co-operative game. People have to work together to kill people on the island, but it\u0027s a very innocuous type of killing, there\u0027s no blood or gore. Games are designed to be engrossing. They are not designed for you to pick them up and then put them down five minutes later. But there\u0027s no evidence that Fortnite is any more addictive than any other game.

Businessman Steve Taylor, 55, says that on returning to Manchester from his 13-day break to Canada he found out his luxury 4x4 had been driven three times, despite claiming staff told him his car would be parked 500 metres from the airport. Steve paid \u0026pound72 to leave his left his Autobiography-series with Manchester Airport Parking Services Ltd on June 6. When Steve complained to the firm, he says they initially replied to say his car had been moved from one compound to another and blamed the ‘works going on around the airport’. But when Steve responded with proof from his route tracker, they accepted they were at fault.      Steve claims that according to his mileage tracker, his car had been driven:      June 6: From Wilmslow to Higher Bury Street in Stockport and back to Wilmslow  June 10: From Wilmslow to Higher Bury Street in Stockport at 1am. At 1.15am on a 3km journey around Stockport the car triggered a speeding fine   June 18: Back to Manchester in time for Steve’s arrival        Steve, the director of a construction firm, says all his radio stations had been changed and, to add insult to injury, he received a speeding ticket four days after his return. It was dated June 10 - while Steve says he was in the middle of his holiday in Vancouver. An email from Manchester Airport Parking Services, also known as Meet and Greet Manchester Airport Parking Services, on June 28, read: “We are sorry for the delays, we are very apologetic for the misuse of the vehicle and the driver involved in the incident has been fired. We have a car park at Higher Bury St and also another in Styal Wimlsow, we have looked at the tracker info you sent to us and have reviewed it and we admit the car had been misused.  We would like to reimburse you for the petrol used and the misuse of the vehicle with a refund for the parking. Please let us know how you would like to proceed further thank you.”  But Steve told the Manchester Evening News he cannot get the firm to address the speeding ticket - and wants to warn other potential customers.  He added: “When the (speeding) ticket was issued I was in Vancouver and can prove it. “I have made over 20 phone calls but nobody is answering.”  Manchester Airport Parking Services Ltd about Steve’s complaint, they said in a statement they had not received any evidence of a speeding ticket: “We were only contacted by this customer a few days ago and asked for time to investigate and have assured the customer that we will take responsibility if we are at fault. However need a copy of the speeding ticket as we so far have no evidence of any speeding ticket. The firm added that it was ‘normal’ to take cars staying for more than six days to their overflow compound, a policy which is in their terms and conditions. The spokesman added: “We have since contacted the customer for the evidence of a speeding ticket and also offered to pay towards any petrol as a gesture of good will.” In April a holidaymaker returned to find his Range Rover \u0027smashed to smithereens\u0027 after leaving it with the airport meet and greet company.

Raymond Bowen left Kirsten Ashby scarred from head-to-toe and in excruciating pain following the horrific attack. She was left with no finger tips, no ears and layers of her skin on her face melted away. The 27-year-old\u0027s injuries were so severe her face was left unrecognisable from the third degree burns after she was turned into a human fireball when the fuel was poured over her and set alight with a lighter.  As Kirsten screamed in agony she could see him smirking and smoking a cigarette through the flames. Today Lord Justice Davies said the sentence was unduly lenient for a man who deliberately fetched petrol from a garden shed to carry out the attack. Bowen had admitted a charged of attempted murder. The judge increased the sentence to life with a minimum of 12 years to serve and said: We have found this to be an extremely difficult and upsetting case. The summary of events illustrates just how utterly cruel and callous the actions of the offender were, and the appalling life changing affects on Kirsten and her family. She and they will have everyone\u0027s total sympathy. He ought to be remorseful for the rest of his life. Even Bowen\u0027s own barrister, Laban Leake, conceded that the sentence was lenient and he would have had no cause for complaint if he had received a heftier or life sentence. Robert Buckland QC, prosecuting, told Appeal Court Judge Lord Justice Davis, Mr Justice Goss and Mr Justice Kerr, that the case would not be the last where victims were left with horrific injuries. He said: It is our submission that the starting point in this case should have been a life sentence.  Sadly this is unlikely to be the only case that will be for the court due to modern medicine that keeps victims alive who would have died without it. Miss Ashby who was left with no fingertips, no ears, layers of her skin on her face melted away, as well as her shoulder-length dark hair burned to a cinder, has remained in hospital since the attack in Milton Keynes, Bucks, in November last year. The young mum was attacked after she went to help a neighbour\u0027s girlfriend who was suffering from a fit. But instead of being grateful for the neighbourly act, Mr Bowen threw petrol over her and stood smoking a cigarette as he lit the flammable liquid with a lighter which consumed her body. Kirsten told how he looked smug as she was set ablaze. Her parents, Lynn and Paul, have taken care of Kirsten\u0027s daughter Maddison since the horrific attack and visited her in hospital as she has undergone a staggering 80 operations to start rebuilding her face and body. Lynn was at the case in the Court of Appeal, in London and revealed today that Kirsten was at home and spending three days a week at hospital\u0027s for treatment.  It was revealed she had to spend 20 hours each day in a compression body sticking and face mask for the next two years. She had also had fingers amputated and had lost all use of her hands. The pain she suffers was hard to manage the court was told. The couple, who were told to expect the worst as she was not expected to survive the horrific ordeal, have since raised almost \u0026pound30,000 pounds for home alterations for her return home. In the first month after the incident Kirsten was placed in the medically induced coma so her body could deal with the shock and pain caused by the extensive burns and she started to pull through. Mrs Ashby said in April: She went there to help, yet what this man did ruined her life and changed our family\u0027s life forever. My lovely daughter was unrecognisable. She had no face - it was all burned away. At first the doctors said she might not pull through. They prepared us for the worst and they put her in a coma for four weeks so her body could cope with the shock and the pain.

They\u0027ve been out and about at several events - both official and unofficial - since tying the knot and they both look happier than ever. But royal fans have noticed one change in their behaviour since their wedding - they no longer hold hands in public. At their first engagements as an engaged couple they couldn\u0027t keep their hands off each other and were constantly holding hands or putting their arms around each other. It was lovely to see, and it was clear how happy and in love they were. But at more recent events it has been a very different story.  Etiquette expert William Hanson has explained why he thinks this is, and it\u0027s nothing to do with it being against royal protocol. As well as holding hands, the couple were seen putting their arms around each other and generally being affectionate during the early days of their relationship. He says it\u0027s probably a confidence thing now Meghan is getting to grips with her new role.   Speaking to Mail Online , he said: Prince Harry has probably felt less of a need to hold Meghan\u0027s hand as she seems to be much more confident and secure in her new role, and so needs less emotional and physical support from her now-husband.  However while it is not banned in the royal rule book, they also need to be professional when out and about on official visits. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also seem to stick to this rule, and they\u0027re rarely seen holding hands during official visits.   Myka Meier , the founder of Beaumont Etiquette, told People : The likely reasoning is more that while travelling on a tour, technically the couple are working representatives of British Monarchy.  The couple are likely to show very little PDA, if any, to remain professional during their designated roles abroad.

Parents Claire and Kurt Brogden welcomed son Jakob and daughter Isla into the world about nine weeks early after the babies suffered complications in the womb.  The twins had never been apart when five-week-old Jakob, who was developing at a faster rate, was allowed to go home from hospital for the first time.  Still in an incubator, Isla needed more time to grow stronger and had to stay behind. But just a day after being separated from her brother, her condition suddenly worsened.  The little girl\u0027s stomach became swollen, her skin was mottled and her veins were visible in her stomach, but tests came back clear. Medics told her parents she was probably just looking for some attention and it\u0027s possible she was lonely without her twin. The only thing they could say to us is \u0027maybe she senses her brother has gone home\u0027, said Claire, from Bradford, West Yorkshire. The couple had found out they were having twins when mum-to-be Claire, 32, had a scan at 12 weeks. They were stunned when a sonographer told them: Here is your baby and here is your baby’s heartbeat. And here is your other baby and the other baby’s heartbeat. It’s twins. Claire didn\u0027t think either one of them had a family history of twins, but later found out that her aunt had a twin who didn\u0027t survive - and so did Kurt\u0027s grandmother. She said: It was a bit of a shock really because we didn\u0027t know until that day that we had any other twins in the family. It was completely unexpected.  But they didn\u0027t get to celebrate the news or the pregnancy like other parents-to-be. Claire\u0027s mum, Christine Berry, 60, was in poor health and died just three months before the twins were born. Claire, who works in admin for an engineering firm, said: At the time of my first scan, when I found out I was having twins, my mum was already in ICU in our local hospital. I remember filling in a baby book that someone had gifted us and one of the pages was \u0027who was one of the first people to see me\u0027 and I broke down crying. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to finish filling the book in because I didn\u0027t want to believe that there was a chance my mum wouldn\u0027t be around to help me become the best mum to my babies. The day before my mum died I had a 16-week gender scan. I hate the thought that she never knew what her grand-babies were going to be. She added: I didn\u0027t really feel that I could be happy through the pregnancy or at least show it because of everything that was going on regarding my mum. I feel like I have a empty space in what should be happy memories.  Twin pregnancy are know for complications but I was having one of the most common twin pregnancies and I cant help to think if the stress and upset of my mum dying wasn\u0027t there, would I have carried on to full term? A month after being told they were having twins, Claire and Kurt, 29, a supermarket sales assistant, found out they were a boy and a girl. It was nothing but good news at all of their appointments until Claire was 26 weeks pregnant, when a doctor struggled to get the correct measurements for Isla. The expectant mum was sent for an emergency scan and a CTG - a cardiotocography, which records the foetal heartbeat and uterine contractions - because it was feared Isla wasn\u0027t growing properly. After being monitored for an hour, she was told everything was fine. However, further tests at 28 weeks revealed more worries for Isla and new concern for Jakob. The babies were in separate sacs and they didn\u0027t share the same placenta.   Claire said:   This time, Isla showed static growth and absent end diastolic flow. The sonographer was concerned and sent me for another CTG.  This time, they struggled to get a reading for Jakob and they asked me to come back in the next day.    The doctors told us that it was now very likely that they’d have to deliver the twins early. They were particularly concerned about Isla\u0027s growth and placenta but they were going to do everything they could to get me to 33 weeks.   Claire had daily CTG scans, was put on leave from work and was given steroid injections to help her twins\u0027 lungs. She said: I had hoped that Isla had caught up to Jakob, but a doctor said that I wouldn\u0027t make it past 33 weeks. That\u0027s when I started becoming worried. You just didn\u0027t know what you were going to get from day to day. At 30 weeks, her blood pressure was very high and she was admitted onto the labour ward at Bradford Royal Infirmary for an emergency Caesarean section. As she waited, she was put on a magnesium sulphate drip to help the babies’ brains develop.  It was a busy time in the labour ward and Claire was told her babies would be delivered the following morning. But she woke up to bad news - a mum-to-be was in premature labour and needed one of the two incubators marked for the twins. It meant that Claire would have to give birth elsewhere or the twins would have to be transferred to a different hospital as soon as they were delivered. The company Embrace, which locates empty incubators across the UK, found none available in Yorkshire. The closest pair was almost 100 miles away in Wrexham, Wales. By the time Claire decided she wanted to deliver in Bradford and then be transferred to Wales, one of the two incubators had been taken. She said: I was told that I was next in line for theatre [in Bradford] but a woman 30 weeks\u0027 pregnant came in in labour and she needed one of the two incubators. We had to start all over again. They had to find another hospital with two incubators and the closest ones available were in Wrexham.  They arranged for an ambulance to take me there and while the ambulance was en route to pick us up one of the incubators in Wales was taken. Luckily, we found out there were two in Barnsley. From Bradford, Claire was transferred 30 miles to Barnsley Hospital for the C-section. She finally entered the delivery room at midnight, giving birth to son Jakob Leslie, who weighed 2lb 12oz, and daughter Isla Christine, who arrived two minutes later weighing 1lb 14oz. Jakob arrived at 12.58am on August 28, 2016, while Isla arrived two minutes later - almost 48 hours after their mum was first admitted to hospital in Bradford. The babies - now aged 22 months - were taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for special treatment that would last weeks.  As Claire was bedbound while recovering from surgery, Kurt would visit the twins in a different room and bring back pictures to show her on his mobile phone. Isla was on a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, where oxygen is blown in at a constant pressure to keep the lungs open between breaths. Jakob was on a bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) machine, a type of ventilator, and was receiving phototherapy for jaundice. Claire was discharged a few days later, but there was a moment of panic because neither she nor Kurt has a licence to drive a car, and the babies were still in a hospital far from home. Luck was on her side this time, as a parents\u0027 room was available on the ward in Barnsley. About 60,000 babies, or one in every 13, are born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) in the UK every year, according to the charity Bliss. The earlier they are born, the more vulnerable they are because they haven\u0027t fully developed in the womb Some may suffer from conditions such as behavioural difficulties, long term health problems or cerebral palsy as they develop into children and adults. Some research has found that the earlier a baby is born the higher their risk of having special educational needs at school, the charity said. It added: It is important to remember that every baby is different and will develop differently. If you are worried about your baby’s development please speak to a health professional. However, when the twins were well enough to be transferred back to Bradford, no incubators were immediately available. Fortunately, two soon opened up and the twins were transferred - Isla first with her mum and Jakob next with his dad. Despite her small size, Isla underwent daily blood tests which took their toll on her. She had a blood transfusion at just two weeks, while her brother\u0027s condition improved. He came off all the equipment, was bottle feeding and was out of the incubator by four weeks, and his parents were allowed to take him home when he was five weeks. But Isla was improving at a slower rate and she had to stay behind without her brother, meaning they were separated for the first time. It was then that her condition suddenly worsened without explanation. Claire said: We were thrilled with Jakob’s homecoming but the next day, Isla had taken a turn for the worse.  The day after Jakob went home we took him back so he could see Isla but when we got there she was in her incubator and doctors and nurses were standing around her. Her stomach had become very swollen. She had gone quite mottled and pale in colour. You could see the veins in her stomach and her skin had gone quite transluscent. It was suspected she had the terrifying disease NEC [necrotising enterocolitis, in which the intestinal tissues become enflamed] and all feeds were stopped while many tests were carried out. The results came back and revealed that there wasn’t anything medically wrong with her. The doctors had no explanation. She said medics then told her and Kurt that their daughter might have sensed that her twin had gone home without her. Two weeks after Jakob was discharged home, Isla was moved from an incubator to a cot. Her feeding tube was soon removed and she was almost well enough to go home for the first time and rejoin her brother.  But there was another setback - she required another blood transfusion. It extended her hospital stay by a few more days, but Isla\u0027s parents were finally given permission to take her home and reunite her with Jakob.   Claire said: I felt relieved and revitalised to be leaving the neonatal ward. The pregnancy and early days of parenting had been a whirlwind. There were so many low moments: I had lost my mum while I was pregnant, I had struggled to express milk and Isla’s health had been a constant worry.  No one will ever understand how much the NICU staff helped me through those darkest moments.   The nurses were amazing. Claire missed her mother during those tough moments and is devastated that her children will never meet their grandmother. She said: My friend gave birth the week before me to her full-term baby and I remember all her family gathering around her house and the baby been passed around her parents.

The religious ceremony will occur at Chapel Royal in St James\u0027 Palace - the same location Prince George\u0027s christening was held in 2013.  However there is one big difference between these two christenings and that of their sister, Princess Charlotte .  Instead of Chapel Royal, Charlotte was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in July 2015.  This difference in location was not due to her gender or rank - as Charlotte made royal history when Louis was born by becoming the first princess not to be overtaken by her brother in the line of succession to the throne. She remains firmly in fourth place, ahead of both Louis and Prince Harry. The reason for the change in location is thought to be because of the church\u0027s proximity to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s former home at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. The couple now reside at Kensington Palace.  The Church of St Mary Magdalene is an especially meaningful place to Prince William as it was where his mother, Diana, was christened. As well as giving her late grandmother a nod with her christening, Charlotte also shares her name, with Diana being one of her middle names. Her full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana. Kensington Palace announced that Louis\u0027 christening will take place on July 9.

Sometimes it can feel incredibly daunting posting your own snaps for your followers to see. But if you\u0027re keen to improve your photo game, there\u0027s a new trend you need to know about. Or more specifically, a new pose. If you take a closer look at any celebrity Instagram account, you might have started to notice a certain similarity between their photos. That\u0027s because they\u0027ve all been doing something very specific with their feet.   Dubbed, \u0027Barbie feet\u0027 by Who What Wear , the stylish pose has taken social media by storm.  But the trick is so simple you\u0027ll kick yourself for not thinking of it before. \u0027Barbie feet\u0027 involves balancing on the balls of your feet, as if wearing an invisible pair of high heels. The shape and position of the foot when doing the pose can be compared to that of a Barbie doll, whose feet are molded into a permanent point - hence the name.  People are opting to strike a pose in this way for one very obvious reason. It\u0027s incredibly flattering It\u0027s no secret that heels are the most flattering form of footwear as they elongate the legs and make them appear slimmer. So Instagram pros are opting to create the illusion of wearing heels to appear more photogenic in places where shoes just aren\u0027t practical.  It\u0027s especially favoured by stars posing in bikinis on the beach with bare feet. Scroll through the Instagram feeds of the likes of Bella Hadid, Victoria Justice, Yovanna Ventura or Kourtney Kardashian and you\u0027ll see the pose in action.

The 13-year-old, whose name has not been released, is said to have inserted half the USB cable - about 20 centimetres (7.8 inches) - up his penis before realising he could not pull it out again. His concerned parents took him to a local hospital in the county of Linkou in China\u0027s north-eastern Heilongjiang province, where medics applied lubrication in a bid to pull the cable out.

A head and a number of bloodied body parts and limbs were found near the scene after at least three illegal hunters were devoured by the predators. Staff at the Sibuya Game Reserve, in Eastern Province, South Africa, called in a helicopter to search the area for more poachers. A vet then had to tranquilise the six lions so police could go inside and recover the remains of the mauled poachers. Owner Nick Fox, 60, said: “We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more. “They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.  “They were clearly intent on killing rhinos and cutting off their horns. “But the lions are our watchers and s and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal. “Whilst we are saddened at any loss of life the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner. The remains of the bodies were found as darkness fell on Tuesday. Staff had to wait until Wednesday morning until the area could be declared safe to go in and recover what was left A police spokeswoman confirmed the grim discovery was made in the lion camp.  Captain Mali Govender said: “We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before. The game reserve is one of the most popular in the Eastern Cape with British tourists and is home to the Big Five of elephant, rhino, buffalo, lion and leopard and is set in 30 square miles. In 2016 the reserve lost three rhinos when poachers got into the park and shot them dead for their horns. Nine rhinos - all of which were shot with a high-calibre hunting rifle - have been killed by poachers on Eastern Cape reserves already this year. It is hoped the gang eaten by lions are responsible for the deaths. The most high profile animal killing in recent times came when American dentist Walter Palmer shot Cecil - a famous lion in Zimbabwe. Palmer killed the black-maned male after the lion was lured from the protected Hwange National Park paying a reported \u0026pound35,000 to hunt the wild beast. The father-of-two then disappeared when he became the target of furious protesters over the execution.

Anthony Doolin bought the property, in Brisbane, Australia, over three years ago for $1.35million (\u0026pound754,000). But it wasn\u0027t until he went wandering around his 16.5 hectares of land that he made the startling find. And it turns out the estate, which is just 12 miles from the central business district of Brisbane, is home to number of other mines. They had remained hidden in the hills since the turn of the century - until now. A surprised Mr Doolin revealed he immediately thought of movie character Indiana Jones when he stumbled upon the mines.  He told realestate.au: We weren’t told about it, we just found it there one day. “I nearly fell over, I just pictured Indiana Jones and underground railroads. There was a lot of mining at the turn of the century and in those hills there are quite a few little mines. It’s about six metres deep and is still intact.”  Despite the spectacular discovery, Mr Doolin didn\u0027t explore the mines further in search of precious gold. And he parted ways with the stunning estate last week. His mother Jane sold the property for him. The reported asking price of $1.65million (\u0026pound922,000) was not met and the Mr Doolin eventually settled for the same fee he had initially paid for it.

Co-op helped set up the Fairtrade Africa\u0027s Women\u0027s Leadership School project, which works with women in cocoa farming groups in Ivory Coast, in Spring 2017. The project hopes to empower the women as future leaders. It aims to encourage the younger generation to be cocoa farmers as many are choosing to move to the city in search of a more dependable livelihood. This is because female farmers still face legal, cultural and social barriers in the industry, according to Co-op, which supports the funding of the project.  Those who participate in the leadership school are trained business skills such as decision making, resource management, leadership and human rights. Co-op says it is passionate about creating sustainability in the cocoa industry by giving female farmers access to training and resources. It was the first retailer in the world to launch its own brand of Fairtrade chocolate bar. For almost two decades, it has obtained cocoa from Kuapa Kokoo, an organisation that enables their farmers to invest in improving clean water, healthcare, sanitation and training. And, as World Chocolate Day approaches on Saturday, it has emerged that more than two million Co-op Fairtrade chocolate bars have been sold worldwide.   An incredible 2.1 million chocolate block bars have been sold since April 2017, Brad Hill, Co-op\u0027s Fairtrade strategy manager, said: We have been championing Fairtrade cocoa in Co-op products for almost 20 years so consumers know they\u0027re helping communities in developing countries to get a fair deal. The UK is the world\u0027s biggest Fairtrade market and the world\u0027s fourth biggest consumer of chocolate and this demand for cocoa is only set to rise. It\u0027s imperative that we keep moving forward with sustainabilty initiatives in order to shape this industry and we must help to improve the lives of farming communities who are still suffering a raw deal.

They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus haber sparks speculation his days at dundee are over as he jets off but not with dark blues squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStriker Marcus Haber’s time at Dundee appears to be at an end with the player in talks over a move to South Africa.The player himself sparked speculation over his future after posting pictures of himself on social media.While the Dark Blues first-team squad were heading for a training camp in Portugal’s Algarve yesterday, the Canadian was posting pictures of himself embarking on aThe Tele can confirm that trip is to talk over a switch to the ABSA Premiership, though to which Johannesburg club it’s still unclear.Haber’s first posts showed him at Glasgow airport about to board a flight for London.Later in the day he posted again complaining a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg had been delayed.So far there has been no word of which South African club he may be heading out to join.Since new gaffer Neil McCann took over last year, the 29-year-old has been very much a fringe player.\u0026mdash Dundee Football Club (@dundeefconline) July 4, 2018He only made 13 appearances last term, the final one coming in the 4-1 home defeat at the hands of Ross County in February.He did have back problems that required surgery but even before then it was clear he was no longer first-choice striker.Haber has not been involved in either of the pre-season friendlies to date and is behind Sofien Moussa, new signing Jean Mendy and even kid Matty Henvey in the pecking order.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"no more overnight closures at strone point","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 3:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe second of two nights of planned closure on the A83 trunk road will no longer be needed.The closures \u0026#8211 on Wednesday and Thursday July 4/5 \u0026#8211 were planned to allow resurfacing work at the Strone Point realignment project, near Inveraray.Trunk road management firm BEAR Scotland announced on Thursday afternoon that the works carried out during the Wednesday overnight closure had progressed well, and the surface course of the new carriageway has now been completed.A spokesperson added: \u0026#8216No further road closures will be required during the remainder of these improvement works with traffic management now reverting back to a two way temporary traffic light set up for the final aspects of the project.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert expects no sewage running down streets","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/07/18, 2:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe reason for raw sewage running down Tarbert’s streets is under investigation.On Thursday June 28,  sewage was seen bubbling up through drain covers and running along the kerbsides on Harbour  Street.The cause of the discharge is as yet unknown, but investigations are under way.A Scottish Water spokesman said: \u0026#8216Our sewer response team carried out an investigation after reports of a discharge at a surface water pipe at this location.‘This involved using CCTV cameras to try and ascertain what caused this discharge.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch-pine-marten-family-caught-on-camera-in-scottish-borders-woodland","story":"Tweed Valley Osprey Project Officer Diane Bennett brings the \nBorder \nand \nPeeblesshire News\n\u0026nbspthe latest news from the nests...\nTHE early part of the week was a difficult time for the osprey family at the main nest, as the aftermath of the wild and stormy weather had left the rivers in spate and SS had clearly been struggling to fish for his family.\nLast Wednesday (June 20), there were no fish brought in for the family to feed, Mrs O seemed distressed as the chicks were begging for food which she could not provide for them.\nThe chicks, at not much more than a week old, were feeble looking and weak.\nThey had little in the way of down covering on their bodies and their progress seemed to be in jeopardy.\nBy Thursday morning (June 21), the weather had taken a turn for the better and the rivers had begun to clear again and ponds were settling after so much silt laden water had washed into them from the feeder burns.\n^Video credit: Rhona Anderson\nThis gave SS the opening that he needed to get back on top of his game and he did his family proud when he returned to the nest with a gleaming large trout at 10.47am.\nMrs O, took the trout from him and began to feed and in between mouthfuls for herself, she tore off strips to feed the stronger and larger of the two chicks.\nShe fed this little one until it was full and sleepy and then with still so much fish left, she turned her attention to the smaller one and began to feed it.\nEventually both chicks were full and were restful. SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    callback: function() {        RelatedArticleBlock.init(false)    },    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716335804,16335621,16334846,16334786,16334716\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep.

Businesses are also urged to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.\nScottish Water are encouraging residents to do the following: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps in the home whenever possible, and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.\nPeter Farrer, Scottish Water\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoWater usage levels during the current hot summer weather, particularly during peak times such as morning and early evening, mean we are working around the clock to get water around the system quickly enough.\n\u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers.

dual fuel tariff will increase to \u0026pound1,228 a year, a rise of \u0026pound70.\nThe company said the 18% increase in wholesale prices since April due to a number of factors, including the Beast

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-customers-waving-at-us-say-residents-of-new-musselburgh-housing","story":"  They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.

Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove wanted to work in computer games from like primary school.  \u0026ldquoMy end goal is to try to get a job doing 3D somewhere, which is doable."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8010369.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"wrong-site-for-youth-shelter-say-residents","story":"  North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.

The company announced a 1.4% dual fuel increase in April.  Managing director of customers Beatrice Bigois said: \u0026ldquoWe know that another price rise will not be welcome, and we had hoped that our limited changes announced in April would be enough.  \u0026ldquoHowever, energy costs have continued to rise significantly and, despite our best efforts to absorb some of these by reducing the costs within our control, sadly we can no longer sustain this.  \u0026ldquoCustomers who wish to avoid this increase will be encouraged to choose one of our fixed price tariffs when we write to them later this month.  EDF said its standard variable dual fuel tariff will increase to \u0026pound1,228 a year, a rise of \u0026pound70.  The company said the 18% increase in wholesale prices since April due to a number of factors, including the Beast from the East,\u0026nbsp reducing gas storage stocks over the winter, compounded by global oil markets feeding into higher UK wholesale prices for both gas and electricity.  Kevin Pratt, consumer affairs expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement has come from nowhere and really is a bolt from the blue.  \u0026ldquoWholesale costs have been increasing but this is the second price rise from EDF in less than three months and pushes their standard variable tariff right to the top in terms of most expensive \u0026ndash at \u0026pound1,228, just a fraction cheaper than npower.  \u0026ldquoThe previous rise, announced in April and effective from June 7, was relatively small compared to the other Big Six suppliers, but it was still a rise and by announcing another one today they are hitting customers when they\u0026rsquore already down.

However, the overall long-term picture for seabirds is one of decline.  A report by the heritage body assessed 12 types of breeding seabirds, which were found to have declined by an average of 62% from the level in 1986, due to factors such as lower numbers of sand eels and non-native predators.

Negotiations are expected to continue for several weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-longmuir-les-mckeown-remembers-his-bay-city-roller-legend-pal","story":"  The tartan-clad Edinburgh band was massive in the 1970s, thanks to timeless hits such as Bye Bye Baby and Shang-A-Lang and were swarmed everywhere they went by adoring fans.  The mania surrounding the band was so huge, they were put on par with The Beatles as their most successful period was labelled Rollermania, thanks to the hoards of screaming young girls who followed them around.  For years, the band claimed they were swindled out of millions in royalties with some of the members taking action against their old label Arista Records in the US courts.  They split in 1978, with bitter battles over money between band members and managers dragging on for decades, but set in motion a new wave of Rollermania with a return to the concert circuit.  Late in 2015, three of the classic five \u0026ndash Alan, singer Les McKeown and guitarist Stuart \u0026lsquoWoody\u0026rsquo Wood \u0026ndash reunited for a series of shows nearly three decades on from their initial break-up. Hours before taking to the stage at T in the Park at Strathallan Castle estate, Perthshire, in July 2016 \u0026ndash and amid rumours of a dispute between members \u0026ndash Woody announced on social media the gig was to be his last. \u0026ldquoDisappointed is an understatement but outwith my control, he wrote.  However, it\u0026rsquos 2018 and they\u0026rsquore back again \u0026ndash this time as Les McKeown\u0026rsquos Bay City Rollers, with Si Mulvey, Phil Hendriks, Scott McGowan and Dan Guest set to grace the stage at the inaugural Edinburgh music festival ScotFest.  They\u0026rsquore also taking the to the global stage with appearances in Japan and Australia \u0026ndash but you\u0026rsquod better not get them mixed up with the Bay City Rollers.  Talking about their ScotFest appearance, plans to come back to Glasgow and about dedicating their ScotFest performance to Alan, Les\u0026rsquo attitude towards this interview \u0026ndash in hindsight \u0026ndash is no frills and refreshingly to-the-point.  Making reference to \u0026ldquothe Bay City Rollers being back, Les quickly corrects: \u0026ldquoThose Bay City Rollers are gone. This is the new Bay City Rollers, the Les McKeown Bay City Rollers.  So, how did the guys get involved with ScotFest? \u0026ldquoThe organisers put in an inquiry and we responded.  What can fans expect from the reformed Bay City Rollers?  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not reformed, Aftab. And they can expect all the big hits. It\u0026rsquoll be a good day.  Looking to know more about the group coming to Glasgow\u0026rsquos King\u0026rsquos Theatre next April, Les opens up. Glasgow does have that effect on folk, after all.  \u0026ldquoI last played at the Hydro in 2016 and in the Barrowland Ballroom the year before that. I haven\u0026rsquot been to Glasgow in a while, but I\u0026rsquom looking forward to playing the King\u0026rsquos. It\u0026rsquos a classic venue, beautiful theatre. People can just sit back and enjoy the show.  The most poignant moment comes when discussing pal Alan.  There was a great outpouring of support from the across the world of music after the bass guitarist was rushed to hospital on June 7.  He had been described as \u0026ldquoextremely unwell after a virus attacked his organs.  The 69-year-old was on holiday in Mexico with wife Eileen when he fell ill. He was taken to Galenia Hospital in the coastal city of Cancun.  Back in Scotland, Alan lost his fight and passed away after a short stay in hospital on Monday.  Les had planned to travel to Scotland to see Alan the day before ScotFest to visit him in hospital and \u0026ldquocheck in on him and cheer him up because he was \u0026ldquoa really good mate.  However, he quelled fans\u0026rsquo concerns by assuring them the show will go on in Edinburgh. \u0026ldquoAlan always said nothing would stop him from going up on stage, so I\u0026rsquoll make sure I\u0026rsquom on stage dedicating it to him, he says.  \u0026ldquoWe plan on projecting pictures of Alan and the guys having fun and joking around at our shows to show people a good image of Alan.  Keen to focus on the group\u0026rsquos theatre tours, he says: \u0026ldquoWe always do three at the start of the year \u0026ndash January, February March and then three at the end, September, October, November.  \u0026ldquoIn December, we\u0026rsquoll be doing Ireland. They go crazy for us over there.  And it seems I may have found an unlikely fan in Les. Not only did I look him up on social media, but it turns out he did the same on me prior to our call. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore doing good work. Keep it up."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8023698.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"snp-defend-hike-in-football-pitch-fees-in-glasgow","story":"  Kids teams are being hit the hardest, with seven pitch sizes costing more to hire now than they did before May this year.  Under-18s clubs looking to train and use changing rooms at one of Glasgow Life\u0026rsquos seven-a-side grass parks will have to pay an eyewatering \u0026pound12.30-per-hour more than last season.  But the council\u0026rsquos SNP deputy leader David McDonald pointed to reductions in five-a-side fees and synthetic 11-a-side pitch hire as proof that the local authority was making football costs fairer.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos simply not the case to say that pitch fees have increased because across the board there has been a host of changes that have taken place. Yes, it has meant that some prices have gone up, but some prices have come down.  \u0026ldquoElected members will be all too aware of how sensitive issues around football pricing in the city is, perhaps so sensitive that we have inherited a very confused and muddled system.  \u0026ldquoWe are doing all we can to ensure that we increase fairness and access to our football facilities with the ultimate goal of levelling the playing field for clubs across the city.  The previous cost of an 11-a-side grass pitch for two hours, including changing facilities, for adults, was \u0026pound62.60 but that has dropped to \u0026pound60. But for under 18s that has risen from \u0026pound47.30 to \u0026pound48 and for concessions that has dropped from \u0026pound44.10 to \u0026pound36.  For a two-hour hire of the pitch alone, the cost has risen from \u0026pound26.30 to \u0026pound36 for adults, from \u0026pound20 to \u0026pound27 for under-18s and from \u0026pound19 to \u0026pound21.50 for concessions.  The highest increase in costs has been handed out to adults\u0026rsquo teams who train and use changing facilities at seven-a-side grass pitches. They will now pay \u0026pound17.10 more for every hour.  But concessions, including pensioners, those in receipt of state benefits, and asylum seekers, will pay less for six pitch types. That includes paying \u0026pound18.30 less for an 11-a-side indoor pitch.  All age groups will be able to use five-a-side pitches for less, however.  Scotland have not reached a major football tournament in the men\u0026rsquos game since 1998 while the women\u0026rsquos team have never qualified for a World Cup.  A Scottish Football Association\u0026nbspsaid it has more than 300 full-size 3G pitches, with a record 145,000 people having been registered as players last year.  An SFA spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish FA is dedicated to ensuring that the game remains affordable and open to everyone in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile overall responsibility for the pricing of public sector sports facilities rests with local authorities, leisure trusts and the owners and operators of wider facilities, we work closely with these stakeholders to try and ensure that no one is priced out of the game.  It comes as a petition calling on the council to scrap the increased charges has gathered almost 2000 signatures.  George Innes, the head coach of Clyde School of Football started the online campaign. And he said: \u0026ldquoMany clubs are struggling to afford this increase and will see the number of organisations folding this season due to the fact that these prices are unsustainable.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow Life said: \u0026ldquoThe new pricing structure will also allow us to protect our network of 32 Glasgow Club facilities across the city and continue to provide world-class facilities with state-of-the-art equipment at a cost which is competitive and attractive and equal to or better than the private sector."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-whisky-sells-for-over-51000-at-online-auction","story":"  The Bowmore 1966 Samaroli Bouquet was bought for \u0026pound51,611 in an online auction held by Perth-based Whisky Auctioneer, and it attracted more than 50 bids from around the world.

It far exceeds the record set in 2014 when a bottle sold for \u0026pound4,200, according to research from analysts Rare Whisky 101.  Sean McGlone, Whisky Auctioneer director, said: \"It\u0027s widely known that the Bowmore 1966 Samaroli Bouquet has legendary status within the whisky industry.  \"We knew that there would be strong interest in its listing and that it would likely break the previous records, but it has exceeded all our expectations by fetching over \u0026pound50,000.  \"It goes to show how committed people are to collecting and investing in rare vintage whisky, something we are seeing a huge increase in.\"  The Bowmore 1966 Samaroli Bouquet was created by Islay\u0027s Bowmore distillery and renowned Italian bottler, the late Silvano Samaroli.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Whilst travelling\u0026nbspthrough India he came across an old British school satchel\u0026nbspand taken by the design, he decided to get a few made by local artisans. He sold these satchels from the attic in his home, as well as a few vintage furniture pieces from India. These satchels and vintage furniture proved to be quiet popular as they were items people couldn\u0027t get anywhere else.  Things started to grow.\u0026nbspToday,\u0026nbspScaramanga is made up of a team of 10 and has become a globally recognized brand that sells online as well as out of their shop in Cupar. They\u0026nbsphave expanded a\u0026nbsprange of bags to over 50 popular designs and have had their vintage and antique furniture featured in major Hollywood films and television shows.    The design team still gets inspiration from the traditional old school satchel. You\u0027ll see the qualities of a timeless style met with top quality leather in all the bag designs. Men and women of all ages can find a style\u0026nbspthat suits them whether it\u0027s for work, adventure or travel. While the\u0026nbspleather satchel is still the top selling bag, they have a range that includes leather backpacks, laptop bags, messenger bags, handbags, weekend bags and more. The team are proud to get reviews such as \u0027I\u0027ve had my bag for 7 years now and it still keeps better and better with age!\u0027. The signature Hunter leather\u0026nbsplasts for years, thanks to it being\u0026nbspdurable, thick, naturally distressed and it gets better with age. It\u0027s also ethically sourced and comes from the same suppliers we\u0027ve been working with for over 11 years now.\u0026nbsp  The vintage furniture is unique, original and not reproduced.

President Quim Torra, who backs independence for the region, was sworn in by Catalonia\u0027s parliament in May.  He is due to arrive in Scotland on Tuesday following a meeting with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, according to Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar.  He will meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, on Wednesday, Mr Anwar said.  Mr Torra\u0027s visit will follow the latest procedural hearing for Prof Ponsati\u0027s case at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday this week.  It comes ahead of a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Prof Ponsati\u0027s legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, say she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  Her team maintains that the condition of \"dual criminality\" - the issue of establishing equivalent charges in Scots law - is not fulfilled, and a European arrest warrant should not be executed.  However Mr Anwar said the Advocate Depute, acting on behalf of Spain, has advised she faces the equivalent charge of treason in Scots law.  He said: \"Clara Ponsati maintains her innocence of the charges and our instructions remain to robustly defend her from extradition to Spain.  \"Clara regards it as surreal that she is now accused of treason, when the Spanish state blames the Catalan government for executing a law that was voted on in the Catalan Parliament elected by the Catalan people.  \"From the very beginning we have submitted that the condition of dual criminality is not fulfilled in Scotland, and the European arrest warrants should not be executed.\"  READ MORE: \u0027Scotland\u0027s independence day is coming soon\u0027, says Ian Blackford  A Crown Office spokesman said: \"In extradition cases in Scotland, the Crown is required by statute to act on behalf of the requesting state or territory.  \"Once proceedings are active, any question as to the progress of the case is a matter for the court.

Producers are warning that Scotland\u0026rsquos staple potato crop - already behind thanks to late and deep snow - will struggle in soil baked by weeks of sun and dried out by the wind.  But the same weather threatening our chips and crisps is great for our berries. Farmers are talking about a bumper crop of soft fruit - provided they can find the labour to pick it.  There are real worries, however, about supplies of fodder going in to next winter with Scotland potentially facing a shortage of straw. Some farmers, insiders warn, may have to sacrifice less productive cattle for mince if feedstock prices rise.  Andrew McCornick, president of the National Farmers Union in Scotland, explained the very mixed picture brought for the sector.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis year started with a long and expensive winter, caused by a combination of poor weather and a hangover from the previous year\u0026rsquos difficult harvest.  \u0026ldquoMany farmers and crofters found themselves chasing their tails for the whole of the winter and most of the spring.  \u0026ldquoFrom an arable perspective, the delays in sowing and crop husbandry during the difficult winter and spring, on top of the delays caused by a poor harvest last year, mean that the true effects of the weather will not be truly known until after this year\u0026rsquos harvest.  \u0026ldquoThe recent dry spell has been a welcome relief for many of our members who, after suffering a dreadful 12 months of weather previously, have had an opportunity to cut hay and silage, graze livestock outdoors, and generally enjoy the simple pleasures of working outside in good weather.  The upside is that the winter fodder harvested so far is good but farmers will be watching the weather carefully to see how much hay they have. They may not be able to swap straw for hay if the grass does not grow well.    Scottish arable farmers used to have so much straw left after they gathered their barley that they burnt it. Now many mash the stalks back in to the ground - even as demand from power generators for the product rises.  But Mr McCornick and other experts have been warning there may not be a lot of straw left this year, for both food and bedding.  He said: \u0026ldquoStraw supplies look like they may become an issue later on in the year and we are encouraging those who will need straw to negotiate a reasonable price sooner rather than later. \u0026ldquo  \u0026ldquoI am always wary when discussing the downside of warm weather in Scotland, as it is such a rarity. That being said, many parts will be hoping for a spot of rain. A little bit of moisture would be a great help to grass growth and for those who are relying on a second cut of silage, as well as our arable members who will be looking for some wet weather to swell grain as we quickly approach harvest time.  There may not be much straw but there is plenty of strawberries, which boom in the sushine.  Mr McCornick said: \u0026ldquoEarly reports on the soft fruit harvest suggests exceptional quality, the hot weather fuelling excellent demand and packhouses at full throttle.  Farmers last month reported a glut of the fruit. Aldi, the discount supermarket, took 80 tonnes of extra deliveries and started selling them in bigger punnets.  The crash in the pound means Scottish farmers are struggling to attract pickers from eastern Europe to bring in their harvest. Producers have raised wages and offered signing-on bonuses as workers fail to materialise.  Some farmers in Scotland may benefit from smaller crops of other produce, including English lettuce wilting in high temperatures, meaning lower labour requirements. There are concerns over other products too, including courgettes. Some growers expect supermarket shortages of greens within the next two weeks.  Growers of potatoes and salad crops need water right now as the plants, delayed by the Beast from the East, move in the period when they should bulk up.  Ayrshire new potatoes arrived in the shops a fortnight later than usual as spring arrived late and the March deep cold frosted off young plants. Yields in Ayrshire were down about 10 per cent, according to figures from earlier this month. Crops further south, which appear earlier, were affected even more seriously. Prices are not expected to compensate farmers for smaller crops.  Ice-cream sales, meanwhile, continue to boom, with or without strawberries. Britain may spend as much as a \u0026pound1 billion this year.  Sales across the British Isles are understood to have doubled Waitrose said customers had bought a record number of children\u0026rsquos lollies, up 175 per cent. Adult lollies, it said, grew even faster, by 188 per cent.  The Aberdeenshire ice cream maker Mackie\u0026rsquos said its sales were up more than a quarter from May last year. It sold the equivalent of 1.1m scoops in the month, enough for every man, woman and child in Glasgow to have one each. The business also said sales of ice were roaring."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-independence-day-is-coming-soon-blackford","story":"  The SNP\u0027s Westminster leader warned the Conservative Party\u0027s treatment of Scotland would accelerate separation, as he told of \"real anger\" among Scots at seeing Holyrood and their rights being \"attacked\" by the UK Government.  Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.  At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to \"lower the temperature\" due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.  The SNP\u0027s motion urges the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government \"best suited to their needs\".  Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: \"Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day (debate) on July 4 - independence day (in the United States) - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?\"  After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: \"Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I\u0027ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it\u0027s coming soon.\"  Labour\u0027s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: \"You say Scotland\u0027s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.\"  Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland\u0027s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and \"drive us\" out of Europe.  He also railed against the \"biggest power grab\" conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.  Only about 19 minutes were left for debate on devolution changes linked to the legislation when MPs considered amendments made by the House of Lords last month.  The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.  This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.  The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  Mr Blackford said \"unknown territory\" had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers.  He added: \"If (Scottish Secretary David Mundell) recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.  \"A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.\"  Scottish Secretary David Mundell later said the SNP were guilty of \"power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts\".  He said: \"All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.\"  Earlier Mr Mundell told MPs the debate told the public \"everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence\".  He said: \"They\u0027re like a broken record, it\u0027s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.  \"Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.  \"That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it\u0027s a charade today.\""},{"url":null,"title":"fresh-pressure-on-pm-over-brexit-deal-ahead-of-crunch-cabinet-talks","story":"  With little more than a day to go before senior ministers meet in Buckinghamshire to thrash out a white paper, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) warned that a \u0026ldquobad deal could cost it \u0026pound1.2 billion every year.  It follows similar warnings in recent weeks from Airbus and BMW who have voiced concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on UK jobs and investment.  As the same time, Brexit Secretary David Davis is reported to have told the Prime Minister that her \u0026ldquothird way plan to solve the customs issue on the Irish border was unworkable.  The Prime Minister is trying to find a compromise that will secure support from both wings of her Cabinet on Friday, but critics called for the Government to maintain its red lines on leaving the single market and customs union.  A group of more than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith on Wednesday to air their concerns about the prospect of a soft Brexit which would restrict the UK\u0026rsquos freedom to diverge from EU rules in future.  Mrs May heads to Berlin for talks on subjects including Brexit with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, leaving behind a bitterly divided party and Government.  The intervention from JLR saw it warn of \u0026ldquoan unpredictable future for it and its suppliers without \u0026ldquofree and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market.  Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth, said: \u0026ldquoWe urgently need greater certainty to continue to invest heavily in the UK and safeguard our suppliers, customers and 40,000 British-based employees.  \u0026ldquoA bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than \u0026pound1.2 billion profit each year.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around \u0026pound50 billion in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further \u0026pound80 billion more in the next five.  \u0026ldquoThis would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.  The Daily  reported that Mr Davis had written to Mrs May, arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU.  In an attempt to address concerns, Mrs May said at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions the Government would ensure \u0026ldquowe are out of the customs union, that we are out of the single market, that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy.  Her comments came after Jacob Rees-Mogg hit out at reports suggesting the meeting of Cabinet ministers at Chequers would be asked to support close continued alignment on rules for goods and tariffs.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hard to think of a worse idea, he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Daily Politics.  Adopting EU tariffs would be \u0026ldquoabandoning the benefit of Brexit and \u0026ldquoa really foolish policy because it would curtail the UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike its own trade deals.  Asked if he would be prepared to rebel if the Cabinet\u0026rsquos conclusions at Chequers were unacceptable to him, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoIf the agreement from the Cabinet is that we will give the EU \u0026pound39 billion merely on good faith of the EU\u0026rsquos negotiating a trade deal, I will vote against that. I don\u0026rsquot think I can be clearer than that.  In a sign of the tensions within the Tory ranks, one MP said a meeting of the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) on Tuesday night was the \u0026ldquoangriest he had ever been to \u0026ldquoeven stretching back to Maastricht \u0026ndash referring to the bitter battles fought during John Major\u0026rsquos premiership.  The subsequent meeting with the Chief Whip was used by the ERG MPs to spell out their demands for the forthcoming White Paper, stressing that there must be no watering down of the position set out in the Conservative manifesto.  There was also widespread concern among the MPs about the role being played by Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Europe adviser and the senior official involved in negotiations with Brussels.  And there were demands for a greater emphasis to be placed on preparing for a \u0026ldquono deal Brexit.          Cabinet #Brexiters please stand up for the 17.4 million people who voted to leave.

A group of nerve agents which are more potent and lethal than VX or sarin.  They are made of two separate non-toxic substances that work as a nerve agent when brought together.  Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said: \u0026ldquoNovichok is not really very different from all the classics, you\u0026rsquove got the same basic chemical framework at the heart of it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos ever really been used. There\u0026rsquos not much experience of seeing these things, they would have recognised it was some sort of nerve agent, which is part of the reason for the delay [in identifying it].  \u0026ndash Why was it created?  Novichok, which means newcomer in Russian, was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s as a new kind of chemical weapon that would be harder to detect, more potent than existing nerve agents and exempt from the Chemical Weapons Treaty.  Dr Sella said: \u0026ldquoNovichok agents are ones that were kept very quiet by the Russians and developed to try and gain advantage against the more conventional things they knew Western governments had.  \u0026ndash How does it work?  Novichok and other nerve agents attack the nervous system and stop chemical messages getting around the body.  They cause the heart to slow down and airways to become constricted, leading to suffocation or brain damage.  \u0026ldquoIt must be excruciatingly painful and unbelievably violent, Dr Sella said.  \u0026ldquoYou have very painful muscle contractions, vision goes pretty quickly and what little you can see is blurred, then you can\u0026rsquot breathe.  \u0026ndash What are the symptoms?  Nerve agents, including Novichok, can be inhaled as a fine powder, absorbed through the skin or ingested.  Symptoms can start within seconds or minutes of being exposed and include convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure and death.  \u0026ndash How can it be treated?  The treatment for nerve agents is to administer an antidote immediately, but some of the damage from the chemical and oxygen starvation can be irreparable.  It is not known if there is an antidote available for Novichok."},{"url":null,"title":"jacques-vert-administrators-to-close-all-concessions-leading-to-840-job-losses","story":"  Administrators Duff \u0026amp Phelps have failed to find a buyer for the business, which first fell into administration in May.

This ungracious, unkind, generally beelin\u0026rsquo 50 per cent of the population (Mori Polls don\u0026rsquot confirm these stats but my Whattsap comments don\u0026rsquot lie) simply refused to accept England had been the better, less criminally active team who deserved to beat the team known not entirely affectionately as \u0026ldquoEscobar\u0026rsquos Eleven.  But where\u0026rsquos the connection with Love Island, the paradise created by ITV producers in order to seize the summer ratings I hear you wonder? It\u0026rsquos schadenfreude. It\u0026rsquos the ugly desire to see those who do us no real harm suffer.  This week in Love Island, the drama unfolded when Dani Dyer, whose dad happens to be the famous Eastender (who so neatly summed up David Cameron last week as being a \u0026ldquotwit, give or take a vowel), saw her sunshine smile wiped off her face by a bucket of freezing, dirty rainwater in the form of a bad news.    The show\u0026rsquos producers decided to up the watching ante by having her new love\u0026rsquos ex girlfriend parachuted onto Love Island, (figuratively) then led Ms Dyer to believe her beau was enjoying Biblical relations with the ex. (Unknown to the TV star\u0026rsquos gel, her hunk was being a perfect gent.)  As a result, Dani Dyer broke her heart on national television, and ratings soared. Now, the success of the show is predicated upon viewers looking on vicariously to see couples coupling, but a great many love to see the beautiful bodied come unstuck. And schadenfreude is a sport we Scots excel in. Gore Vidal\u0026rsquos maxim \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not enough that I succeed, others have to fail, is in our DNA.  Yes, there is the argument that those who enter the likes of Love Island should know there is no such thing as a free holiday. Over the years the reality format has excelled in creating conflict Sylvester Stallone\u0026rsquos mother entering the Big Brother house, Richard Blackwood\u0026rsquos Celebrity Detox demanding contestants reveal the contents of their colonic irrigation, which meant this literally was s*** TV. And we can go back to Channel 4\u0026rsquos The Word, to recall a segment \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod do anything for fame, in which one week a teenager proved this point by snogging an 80 year-old toothless granny.  But those who arrive on Love Island don\u0026rsquot always see this coming. They\u0026rsquore part of the selfie generation whose purpose in life is to look great, get an advertising deal and meet another self-absorbed narcissist. That may not be up there with finding a cure for cancer, but that\u0026rsquos no reason for taking pleasure at watching someone\u0026rsquos mind unravel like a ball of wool attacked by a manic cat.  Why do we Scots find it so much easier to trash others\u0026rsquo success or fame? It\u0026rsquos because we\u0026rsquore not, (even though we like to think we are) a confident nation. We\u0026rsquore not big enough to applaud success. This is partly down to the fact Scotland has a long had a strong egalitarian notion, but this fosters the idea that no-one is special, that we should all be trapped on the lower level. Scotland\u0026rsquos Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing suggests that paradoxically, in a society where people do not set out equal in life, our instilled sense of egalitarianism actually reinforces class (and gender) inequality.  There\u0026rsquos another reason for us not being confident. Strong Labour and Calvanistic conditioning has told us we shouldn\u0026rsquot draw attention to ourselves. And it is conditioning. You aren\u0026rsquot born with alack of self-worth, as the song from South Pacific, You\u0026rsquove Got To Be Carefully Taught, underlines. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove got to be taught before it\u0026rsquos too late. Before you are six or seven or eight. To hate all the people your relatives hate. You\u0026rsquove got to be carefully taught.  What\u0026rsquos clear is we have national low self-esteem issues. We have not become Europe\u0026rsquos worst drug abusers for no reason. But in being too quick to criticise success, or deride those who achieve fame, for whatever reason, we perpetuate this cycle of astonishingly heavy criticism, while reducing our own possibilities. In that sense, we need to be less Scottish.  But there\u0026rsquos some hope. As far as Love Island is concerned, Ofcom has received 2500 complaints about the treatment of Dani Dyer. It would be nice to think some of them came from Scotland. When England marched around Celtic Park before the Commonwealth Games of 2014 they got the biggest cheer of the night, apart from Scotland. And half of the Columbia match Whatsapps were supportive of England, which wouldn\u0026rsquot have been the case a decade ago.  So let\u0026rsquos analyse ourselves. If we don\u0026rsquot want England to win has it anything to do with the Act of Union, or years or perceived subjugation? Or more to do with the fact we can\u0026rsquot beat Slovakia to qualify? Come on, let\u0026rsquos get behind the Kane gang."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-and-wales-demand-sight-of-uk-brexit-blueprint","story":"  Edinburgh and Cardiff said the Joint Ministerial Committee would be meaningless without prior sight of the White Paper setting out the UK\u0026rsquos preferences on customs and trade.  The paper is due to be published next week, provided Theresa May can secure sign-off from her divided cabinet at Chequers tomorrow.  However there were further reports of dissent yesterday after Mrs May, having ditched two previous customs options because of infighting, was said to have settled on a \u0026ldquothird way that was a decidedly soft Brexit.  Around 40 Tory MPs reportedly warned chief whip Julian Smith their party would be \u0026ldquotoast if the Prime Minister abandoned her Brexit red lines.  The third way is understood to involve the UK collecting EU import tariffs, a central plank of the supposedly abandoned \u0026ldquocustoms partnership model, which Boris Johnson dismissed as \u0026ldquocrazy.  Mr Smith is expected to brief ministers on the parliamentary arithmetic for different options.  At PMQs, Tory Sir Edward Leigh asked if the UK\u0026rsquos negotiating position would be \u0026ldquofull and unfettered control of migration, trade deals, and business law.  Mrs May said Brexit meant an \u0026ldquoindependent trade policy, Westminster sovereignty and an end to free movement but did not say anything was unfettered.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell and Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford are due to discuss the White Paper with Cabinet office minister David Lidington this morning.  However they said the process was becoming nonsensical because the UK government refused to share basic information about the content.  In a joint letter, they complained a recent low-level meeting of ministers had been was \u0026ldquounsatisfactory because they were \u0026ldquonot permitted to see a single word of the draft White Paper in advance, and could only contribute on the basis of brief, oral summaries.  \u0026ldquoWe therefore wish to make it absolutely clear that we will not regard any discussion of the White Paper at Thursday\u0026rsquos JMC (EN) as meaningful, unless we have been given prior access to the text of the draft White Paper as it currently stands, they wrote.  Threatening to denounce the JMC as a joke if nothing charged, they added: \u0026ldquoIf we do not have this opportunity, we will have to make it very clear that we have been given no real possibility to consider, let alone influence the content of a document which will purport to speak on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom, about matters, many of which are devolved... of the greatest possible importance to the people of Scotland and Wales.  Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos meeting is an important point for us to take stock with the Scottish and Welsh Governments. We are determined to get the best possible Brexit deal for all parts of the UK. This is a good opportunity for those of us in the UK Cabinet to hear what the devolved governments have to say."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-walk-glasgow-dozens-of-city-roads-set-to-close-for-annual-boyne-parade","story":"  Closures will start at 9.30am and will continue until around 12.30pm to allow the parade access.

Mr Salmond lost Gordon last year after the biggest swing to the Tories anywhere in the UK.  To the dismay of many former colleagues, he has since worked as a TV presenter on the Alex Salmond Show on the Kremlin-backed RT channel.  The 63-year-old was asked about his intentions at a recent meeting of the SNP\u0027s Aberdeenshire East branch,\u0026nbspthe Daily Record reported.  Asked if he was would stand again for Gordon in the event of a snap election this year, the paper reported that he said he had set his sights \u0026ldquofurther north, referring to neighbouring Banff \u0026amp Buchan.  An SNP source also told the Herald\u0026nbspMr Salmond made the \u0026ldquofurther north remark, but admitted Mr Salmond loves to tease an audience.  However Ms Salmond has now rejected both the words attributed to him and the thrust of the story.  He told the Herald: \"Story is wrong. I said no such thing.\"  Pressed on whether the thrust of the story was accurate, if not\u0026nbspthe quote, he said: \"Story is just wrong - not just words but sense as well.\"  Mr Salmond, who lives in Banff \u0026amp Buchan, hinted at a return to politics the night he lost Gordon to Tory Colin Clark, saying: \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquove not seen the last of my bonnets and me.  Mr Salmond lost after a massive tactical vote by LibDem supporters, who backed the Tories in protest over a second independence referendum.  However the result in Banff \u0026amp Buchan was far more polarised, with previous SNP supporters appearing to switch directly to the Tories, giving Mr Clark a majority of 3,693.  Mr Salmond\u0027s residual personal vote in the constituency could tempt some back to the SNP.  The SNP is officially on a campaign footing because of the extraordinary feuding in Theresa May\u0026rsquos cabinet over Brexit, and her fragility as PM.  But the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means there would only be an election if Tory MPs voted for it, and there is no appetite among them for walking into a potential defeat.  SNP deputy leader Keith Brown has been tasked with starting to organise candidate selections over the summer to help get the party ready for any vote or referendum.  A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond was given his jotters by the people of Gordon in spectacular style last year.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquod get a similar response from voters in Banff \u0026amp Buchan.

The Scottish Government provided a grant of £864,000 for the project with Osprey’s funding coming from Lloyds Banking Group.                                                    The tenants really do have a room with a view – while having easy access into Inverurie town centre the flats are in a stunning location overlooking fabulous Aberdeenshire countryside, particularly the iconic Bennachie.         Commenting on the new flats Osprey Chief Executive, Glenn Adcook, said: “I’m delighted to see the completion of such a fantastic development of affordable homes for rent in a much sought after and vibrant area.“Portstown represents our first new build project in the town and is the result of an excellent partnership with local builder Malcolm Allan and the local authority Aberdeenshire Council.“I’d particularly like to pay tribute to Malcolm Allan for the very high quality of the homes they have provided.”Mr Adcook added: “Osprey Housing is helping tackle a real shortage of good quality affordable housing in the area, which is so important for the health and wellbeing of individual tenants in particular and the local community in general.                                                                                                        “This development is just part of our plans to increase the number of homes we build across Aberdeenshire over the next five years.”Colin Wood, Technical Manager at Malcolm Allan Housebuilders, said: “We are delighted to have worked closely with Osprey to help address housing needs in the local area.”Mr Wood added: “This is a high quality development and we look forward to collaborating with them again in the future.”Osprey’s properties consist of six one bed and six two bed homes, which have excellent space standards, can be adapted to meet specific requirements and are highly energy efficient.

Since its completion, the tapestry has toured across the globe attracting over 250,000 visitors from Iceland and Canada to Tasmania and Otago.Initially, communities from 25 countries where Scots had emigrated were invited to take part and groups of volunteers were asked to hand-stitch panels documenting their Scottish connections.However the number of countries expanded and by the end of the project the panels had been stitched by groups from 34 countries.The Scottish Diaspora Tapestry will be a fantastic short-term addition to the Garioch Heritage Centre which showcases local history and provides an insight into the lives and history of the everyday people of the area.

Add on the cost of having an undertaker transport the body, and folk are having to break the bank to bid a final farewell.In comparison, those living in Aberdeenshire who travel to Aberdeen to have a relative cremated pay 12 per cent below the national average.Iain Gregory of Caithness Citizens Advice Bureau said families were finding the added financial burden a struggle \u0026ndash especially when placed on top of the grief of losing a loved one.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy.

I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 4:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

wildflowers.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiative is being led by Scottish Natural Heritage to tackle alien species.Lynn McKelvey, Cromarty Firth Fishery Board project officer, said: \"Here at Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat from invasive species, particularly Himalayan balsam, which spreads so quickly growing in dense stands, meaning no native wildflowers can grow.\"Head teacher Tania Mackie said: \"Outdoor learning is fundamental to the curriculum at Ben Wyvis Primary School, as is working with local partners.\"We are delighted to be working with Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and the SISI project.\"Not only are the children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Thursday 5 Jul 2018 4:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Mr Salmond represented the Aberdeenshire constituency of Banff and Buchan from 1987-2010 in the House of Commons, but when he made his return to Westminster he won in the Gordon constituency in 2015, before being defeated last year by Conservative Colin Clark.             The Daily Record reported today that the former First Minister told a meeting of his local party that if Brexit led to a general election, he would be tempted to stand ‘further North’ than Gordon, taken to be a reference to Banff and Buchan.            However, when contacted by the Scotsman Mr Salmond denied the reporting, claiming he had ‘said no such thing’ at the meeting in question.The ex-SNP leader also said he had nothing to add to his recent speech in Morningside, where he claimed Scottish Independence was inevitable.READ MORE: Alex Salmond prepared to return to frontline for Indyref2The Conservatives also won the Banff and Buchan seat from the SNP at the snap general election of last year, and if Mr Salmond stood he would be attempting to overturn David Duguid’s 3693 majority, more than 1,000 votes higher than the majority in Gordon.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4764529.1530793868!/image/image.jpg","title":"legendary whisky sells for more than 50 000 at auction","story":"        A \u0026#8220legendary\u0026#8221 whisky has sold for more than \u0026#16350,000 at auction.

I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress.

If the UK cannot decide what it wants, it will end up getting exactly what they want. Politicians of all parties need to realise the old fault lines do not apply on this issue and that, for the sake of the nation, they must form an ad hoc ‘national coalition of the sensible’ to secure a Brexit deal that will outrage the hardliners but save the economy from disaster.READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: Doomsday report exposes Brexit vulnerability"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

Two leading Brexiteer cabinet ministers, David Davis and Liam Fox, have told her that plans to combine a customs partnership and technological checks at the UK’s borders cannot be delivered, with Mr Fox said to be considering his position.            Meanwhile, the Scottish Government has repeated its call for the Prime Minister to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, with the SNP’s Brexit minister Michael Russell telling Mrs May to “grow up” and “wake up to reality”.            Mr Russell held talks with UK counterparts in London, and said afterwards that the Scottish Government had no confidence that a draft white paper set to be approved by Mrs May’s Cabinet on Friday could even be delivered.Instead, the government in Edinburgh has produced its own, rival white paper repeating its demands to stay in the single market and customs union, and maintain free movement between the UK and the EU.READ MORE: Michael Sturrock: No deal on data post-Brexit would be devastating“The paper will indicate to people that we have a practical and workable solution for the problems that the UK Government is facing,” Mr Russell said.“What we read of the solutions they are putting forward are neither practical or workable.”He added: “This is a comprehensive document…. it says how we should be dealing with issues and we are trying to say to the UK Government, please grow up, listen to what is real.            “I was in Strasbourg earlier this week. I spoke to members of the European Parliament and members of the [EU] Commission. Everybody uses the same word - reality. The UK Government has to wake up to reality.”Scottish Secretary David Mundell pledged to put forward the Scottish Government\u0027s proposals at Chequers, even though he said \"on a fundamental level, we don’t agree because the Scottish Government doesn’t want to leave the EU.\"\"Leaving the EU is about leaving the single market because it’s not possible to be in the single market and not be in the EU,\" he said. \"I’ll be arguing strongly that our businesses get the best possible access to those markets.\"Mr Mundell added that his \"fundamental requirement\" was the \"integrity of the united kingdom as we leave the EU\" and said he was \"not going to agree or let happen” any backstop plan for the Irish border that creates trade barriers in the Irish sea between Norther Ireland and Britain.            The Scottish Secretary appealed for unity among his cabinet colleagues, warning that \"we have to have a united position in this country as to what we want to achieve, because that’s the most likely way of getting what we want.\"However, on the eve of the day-long talks at the Prime Minister’s Buckinghamshire retreat, ministers voiced skepticism about the so-called \"third way\" to solve problem of post-Brexit customs and preventing a hard border with Northern Ireland.A proposed \"facilitated customs arrangement\" would see technology used to determine where goods arriving into the UK will ultimately end up.This would allow the correct tariff to be paid - either at the UK or EU rate.READ MORE: Theresa May warned UK ‘won’t be an equal’ after BrexitMr Davis is understood to have written to Mrs May, arguing that her new plan to reconcile warring factions over customs arrangements would be rejected out of hand by the EU.

Scotland\u0026#8217s independence day is \u0026#8220coming soon\u0026#8221, Ian Blackford has claimed during a bad-tempered Commons debate.                The SNP’s Westminster leader warned the Conservative Party’s treatment of Scotland would accelerate separation, as he told of “real anger” among Scots at seeing Holyrood and their rights being “attacked” by the UK Government.            Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.            For the UK Government, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the SNP were guilty of “power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts”.At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to “lower the temperature” due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.READ MORE: Ian Blackford reshuffles SNP Westminster teamThe SNP’s motion, approved unopposed, urged the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government “best suited to their needs”.Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: “Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day [debate] on July 4 - independence day [in the United States] - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?”            After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: “Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I’ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it’s coming soon.”Labour’s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: “You say Scotland’s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.”Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland’s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and “drive us” out of Europe.He also railed against the “biggest power grab” conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.            The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers “significant further powers” to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are “not normal circumstances applying” - describing Brexit as such an exception.READ MORE: Anger  over ‘Tory dark money’Mr Blackford said “unknown territory” had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament’s powers.            He added: “If [Mr Mundell] recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.“A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.”Mr Mundell later said: “All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.”He also told MPs the debate told the public “everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence”.Mr Mundell said: “They’re like a broken record, it’s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.“Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.“That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it’s a charade today.”Shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird warned the “flaming of the fires” of a second independence is being “fanned” by the UK Government.The Labour MP said: “The complete inability of the UK Government to negotiate Brexit layered on top of the inability of the UK Government to engage in a meaningful way with the Scottish Government on Brexit has led us down this path.”Ms Laird also accused the SNP of having shown “contempt” for issues of constituents by its choice of topic for debate.Stephen Kerr, Conservative MP for Stirling, said: “The SNP government in Edinburgh agitating for a second independence referendum is a betrayal of the principle of popular sovereignty.“When the people have spoken as they did, it is time for government to shut up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"6 herrisdale park tingwal ","story":"Offers over £145,000\n nursery.\nIn addition to the two double bedrooms, the accommodation includes a single bedroom, dining kitchen, livingroom, shower room and separate toilet.

The boat was equipped with a three bilge-pump system but one of the pumps had failed, meaning they only had one as back-up. Ms Weaver said: “We try to be two failures away from a problem.” Also, she said, she had to “err on the side of caution” because the boat was carrying 12 passengers.\n was able to proceed “under her own power and pumping under her own power” into Lerwick. She is currently in the small boat harbour.\n and two sunken klondykers.\n is used for various types of dive trips, including recreational and wreck diving in locations in Orkney and Shetland, including Scapa Flow and Fair Isle as well as in northern Scotland and Faroe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/webimage/1.4761532.1530201791!/image/image.jpg","title":"braw lads gathering all the photos","story":"\n                \n\n\nRead the report and watch the video by clicking here.\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/webimage/1.4764279.1530779973!/image/image.jpg","title":"former home of borders author walter scott on market for 1 25m","story":"\n\nA former home of author Walter Scott at Clovenfords is on the market for offers over \u0026#1631.25m.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAshiestiel House offers four reception rooms, seven bedrooms and seven bath or shower rooms, two secondary bedrooms, a one-bedroom gardener’s cottage, outbuildings, garage, trout fishing rights on the Tweed and more than 10 acres of land.\n\n\nIt was last marketed last summer as part of a 900-acre estate for offers over £5.5m.\n\n\nIt’s a grade-A listed stately home dating back to the 17th century.  \n\n\nEdinburgh-born Sir Walter, alive from 1771 to 1832, lived there from 1804 to 1812, writing The Lady of the Lake, Marmion, The Lay of the Last Minstrel and some of Waverley there.\n\n\nSo fond of the estate was he, according to some, that had he been able to buy it, he would not have moved to Abbotsford, near Tweedbank, in 1812.\n\n\nThe house was painted by Sir Walter’s friend JMW Turner in the 1830s as an illustration for Marmion.\n\n\nSince 2011, Ashiestiel House has undergone a complete refurbishment project including rewiring, re-roofing of the main part of the house and installation of a new plumbing and new central heating system, double-glazed windows and four-oven electric Aga cooker.  \n\n\nThe house is being marketed by estate agent Savills’ Edinburgh office, and Peter Strang Steel there said: “Ashiestiel House has an extraordinary history and an exceptionally beautiful setting.\n\n\n“Quite apart from its status as a significant Scottish country house and its connections with one of our greatest writers, the superb quality of the refurbishment lavished upon it by the current owners, is quite outstanding.  \n\n\n“With 10 acres of grounds and the option to acquire further properties on the estate if desired, Ashiestiel is likely to cause a great deal of serious interest from far and wide.\n\n\n“Scott’s eight years at Ashiestiel were among the happiest of his life. Indeed, the writer Theo Lang surmises that had Scott been able to purchase the property, ‘overhanging the Tweed and situated in a wild, pastoral country’, the later ambitious project of Abbotsford might never have been realised.”\n\n\nLang writes: “The study was both his dining and writing room, in which were composed the Lay of the Last Minstrel, The Lady of the Lake, and Marmion, as well as about a third of Waverley.”\n\n\nHe adds: “Much of Marmion was penned from the Shirra’s Knowe, a wooded knoll overlooking the Peel and Glenkinnon Burns, and the river walk towards Elibank Tower was Scott’s own favourite Sunday walk.”\n\n\nFor details, go to search.savills/property-detail/gbedrsedr160070 or call 0131 247 3738.\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01634000/01634723.jpg","title":"Aviemore inclulded in disappointing drink driving cases","story":"Tom Ramage\n\nPolice Scotland confirmed today (Monday July 2) that nine drivers are to be reported for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs over the past weekend in the Highlands.\nThe detections came during the first weekend of a national safety campaign aimed at removing drink drivers from the roads.\nOf the cases to be reported seven relate to drink drive offences, with the other two to driving under the influence of drugs.\nThe incidents were recorded across the region - with detections in Aviemore, Easter Ross, Nairn, Orkney, Skye and Fort William areas.\n\"Tackling drink driving is a key priority for police,\" said road policing Inspector Neil Lumsden.\n\"Performance figures reported to Highland Council last week revealed that the number of drivers detected has increased by 13 per cent - equating to 51 drivers more than the same period last year.\n\"To have nine drivers detected under the influence of either drink or drugs in a single weekend is very disappointing,\n\"All of the drivers who will be reported are Scottish residents so should be well aware of both the legislation and the dangers of getting behind the wheel under the influence.\n\"These incidents and the figures reported last week tell us that for a small but significant number of people the message is simply not getting through.
