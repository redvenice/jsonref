Banded brick walls frame stone stairwells with deep oxblood and creamy white tiles. These connect to spacious decks of homes, each identified with a numbered tile.This splendour is just what you would expect to see in the Bourne Estate in Holborn, which boasts some of the finest public tenement housing of Edwardian London. Yet these blocks are not part of the 1905, Grade II-listed estate but a recent addition built by Camden as part of its new generation of council housing. Designed by architect Matthew Lloyd, the buildings exude a quality rarely found in developer-built flats – handsome proportions and crafted details mirroring the love and care that went into the surrounding estate, only brought up-to-date with bigger windows, higher ceilings and more generous spaces.It might sound like an anomaly, but this group of 75 homes is one of many such developments now appearing across London, as local authorities have begun to build their own housing again. They are mostly doing so for the first time in four decades, since Margaret Thatcher took away their powers to build. These were only returned in 2012 and, in the seven years since, London councils have built over 2,000 homes – compared to only 70 in the seven years before that.But it’s not quite social housing as we once knew it. Given the continued lack of central government funding, councils have turned to a more entrepreneurial model, usually including a substantial number of flats for private sale to subsidise the council accommodation. Hackney recently built a pair of David Chipperfield-designed towers, the sale of which helped pay for the regeneration of the Colville estate next door. In Camden’s case, its boutique apartments are marketed as the Camden Collection, with the breathless marketing spiel you would expect from a luxury developer. At the Bourne Estate there are 31 such flats – including two-bedroom ones on sale for £1.3m – in order to fund 35 new council flats and 10 at intermediate rent, leased below market rates.“People might think it’s strange for a council to be behaving like a developer,” says councillor Danny Beales. “But with the current constraints, it’s one of the only ways of funding investment.” Beales is cabinet member for Camden’s Community Investment Programme (CIP), an ambitious 15-year plan to pump over £1bn into schools, homes and community facilities across the borough, funded in large part by the sale of flats built on public land. Exploiting the high value of its central London location – described by the Labour council as its “North Sea oil” strategy – Camden has one of the biggest house-building programmes of all, with over 3,000 homes planned, 862 of which have been completed so far, around half for social and intermediate rent.CIP aims to build on the bold architectural heritage of the borough, which saw some of the most innovative housing of the postwar era – built under council architect Sydney Cook – from Neave Brown’s work at Fleet Road and Alexandra Road to Benson and Forsyth’s Corbusian Branch Hill and Maiden Lane.There may no longer be a borough architect, but Camden has tried to put design at the forefront, holding competitions for each site and involving residents in selecting the winning architects and developing their schemes. The results are erse, ranging from Lloyd’s contemporary Edwardian tenements, to a clumsy attempt to emulate the white modernist language of Maiden Lane, by PRP architects, who have pumped up the low-rise concrete blocks to a steroidal scale.Peter Barber, king of quirky curvy rooflines, has injected a dose of fun with his Holmes Road Studios, providing housing for homeless people around an allotment garden, while Burd Haward have conducted agile urban dentistry in Gospel Oak, inserting a handful of homes into small infill sites.The biggest project of all is at Agar Grove, where a maligned 1960s estate is being overhauled by Hawkins Brown and Mae architects, in a long-term scheme that will see almost 500 new homes built to low-energy Passivhaus standards, responding to the crippling fuel poverty faced by many residents. The masterplan aims to reconfigure the site with streets and squares, introducing new routes through the currently inward-looking estate, including rows of maisonettes by Mae that take inspiration from the split-section layout of Neave Brown’s beloved Fleet Road estate.Ferdinand Daludado, who recently moved into one of the first new blocks, clad in dark purplish brick, couldn’t be more pleased with his airy flat at the top of the building, where he has transformed his big south-facing balcony into a lush hanging garden. “It is so much bigger and brighter than my previous flat on the estate,” he says. “And it only has one radiator, which I barely need to turn on in winter.”With an overall increase of 244 homes, the final tenure mix on the estate will be 216 homes for social rent, 37 at intermediate rent and 240 for private sale – which, in terms of proper council housing, represents an increase of just six homes. The council is quick to point out, however, that the flats are much bigger than those they are replacing, with the overall masterplan representing a third more social rented floor space than before. But the fact that the estate’s central tower block will be reincarnated as solely private flats is an unfortunate symbol of funding realities.“They’ve lost the plot,” says Slaney Devlin, chair of the Somers Town Neighbourhood Forum, which has vociferously opposed the plans. “It’s brilliant that the council is building more social housing elsewhere, but the social value is being missed when they’re designing segregated developments like this. It’s astonishing for a Labour council to be building a tower of investment units on a park. If this is the answer, then they’ve asked the wrong question.” The wider masterplan is centred on a new school and nursery, although it’s now uncertain if the facility is needed, given a drastic drop in pupil numbers which means a school nearby is threatened with closure. “In this case,” says Devlin, “they just got it wrong.”Paul Tomlinson, Labour councillor for the ward, has also raised alarms about what he sees as the imbalance of the CIP programme. Describing the impact as “a kind of social cleansing”, he adds: “It’s great that we’re building again, but the new developments aren’t doing enough to tackle our long social housing waiting list. A lot of our poorer residents with larger families are having to move out of the borough. And now there’s doubt about being able to sell the private flats.”Given the current lull in the property market, the council is considering renting out a number of units – originally planned for sale – at private rent rates, prompting concerns that they will lose their resale value. As the market wobbles, the commercial risks that councils are taking become apparent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50f816ab2abb32cbea40399511a6fcaec6ae812/1505_1388_1943_1166/master/1943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e563a6a63cabd780490a38c645ba2d49","title":"evgenia arbugaeva best photograph arctic childhood tiksi russia","story":"‘Tanya put on her favourite dress, wandered to the sea, and a dog started following her. There are lots of strays in Tiksi – people left their pets during the mass exodus’When the Soviet Union fell, thousands of people left small Russian Arctic towns such as Tiksi, where this photo was taken. It was my home town and I spent the first eight years of my life there, but it stopped receiving financial support and fell into neglect. In 1993, my family became part of the mass exodus.Tiksi was built on the coast of the Arctic Ocean as an outpost on the northern sea route, a port town and a military base during the cold war. When I was growing up, there was a whole secret part of town that even had its own schools where nobody was allowed to go. Tiksi was also really important in the history of Russian Arctic exploration – it’s where the icebreakers set off from. But today it’s struggling.I’d been away almost 20 years before I went back. Returning felt more like stepping into a dream than back into my childhood. When we’re little our memories merge with dreams. The Tiksi I went back to was nothing like the place I left. I found it really depressing. I didn’t have any relatives or friends, and the state of the town shocked me. When I lived there, Tiksi’s population was around 12,000. Now, it’s less than half that.One day, I went to the shore. I saw a family having a picnic with a bonfire. A little girl was throwing stones into the sea. She reminded me of myself. I took a picture of her, from the back, and didn’t think much more of it. But when I returned home to New York it was the only photo I’d taken that was interesting. I knew I had to find her again.I spent two years in and out of Tiksi, much of it with the girl, Tanya. I wanted to reconnect with the town through her eyes: to find her secret places, her favourite spots, and try and recover my past through her.She was a really happy child. She was 12 when I met her, approaching her teenage years, but still very much in her childhood. She was very playful and she loved the idea of photographing Tiksi, showing me around. But she was also very dreamy, and still is. In that regard, we had a lot in common.I was practically living with her family, almost like their adopted daughter. When this photo was taken, it was a beautiful summer’s day in June, and Tanya and I decided to go out for a walk. For some reason, she was convinced she was going to grow out of her favourite dress the following day — she insisted on wearing it because she would never be able to again. She tied her hair in pigtails and we wandered towards the sea.A dog started following us. When people left Tiksi, many abandoned their pets so there are loads of stray dogs wandering through the town. This one clearly wanted Tanya to adopt her. It was a beautiful make-believe: the dog pretended Tanya was its owner, and Tanya pretended the dog was her own.She was always climbing on things and scrambling around. She waded out and jumped on this little iceberg. This is the moment she was beckoning her new dog to join her. I knew I had to get the shot.I think the experience of taking this image was a closure for me. Through Tanya, I was able to reconnect with my childhood, to make sense of the place I had left and to rediscover the Arctic as my homeland.Today, the photo often gets read as a symbol. People have always romanticised the Arctic, and looked at it with a kind of awe. Now, we look at it and we’re scared, or we want to extract something from it. My work isn’t about “saving the Arctic”, but I hope it offers another way of looking at the region: a loving way, an appreciative way, one that reminds the viewer of their smallness in front of it.I’m still very close to Tanya and I know this photo is very special to her. She’s in college now, but she once told me it’s the last image of her before she became a teenager, a time before exams and college and job applications – the last photograph of her childhood.Trained: Documentary photography at the International Center of Photography, New York.Influences: “Magical realist writers in general, Gabriel García Márquez in particular.”High point: “Taking an icebreaker across almost the whole northern sea route for two and a half months.”Low point: “The constant self-doubt of being a freelancer.”Top tip: “Figure out what really moves you and stick with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9d2389663084e427547433e10f979d785091c2/0_346_5134_3081/master/5134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b9337a33ecae6b5619c2caec72141b","title":"faber untold history great publishing house toby faber review","story":"All publishing houses have archives, but for anyone interested in 20th-century literature the archive of Faber \u0026amp Faber is a fabled treasure house. This is the firm that was, as Toby Faber puts it, “midwife at the birth of modernism”. In 1924 Faber’s grandfather, Geoffrey Faber, aspiring poet and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, had been installed as chairman of the Scientific Press, recently inherited by another All Souls fellow, Maurice Gwyer. It published mostly books and journals for nurses. Geoffrey Faber renamed it and started making it into a literary publisher. Within his first year he had installed TS Eliot as a fellow director and acquired his backlist.The firm would go on to publish Ezra Pound, WH Auden and James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake. Then Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Philip Larkin, Seamus Heaney: a poetry list to beat all others. Academics have always itched to get into the Faber archive, to get at the letters and memos that record how this 20th-century canon was made. Toby Faber has rights of entry. He has given us a highly selective anthology rather than a narrative: his book is made up of extracts from original documents (mostly letters, but also memos, board minutes and blurbs), with spare comments from himself.Above all, his book illustrates the firm’s commercial precariousness. In the early years, Faber’s accountant sternly counselled Geoffrey Faber to dump the literary stuff and concentrate on the firm’s only worthwhile commodity, the Nursing Mirror. He was both contradicted and vindicated in 1929 when this periodical was sold for £190,000 – a huge sum at the time – ensuring the survival of the publishing house for the following decade or two. In his struggles to ensure his firm’s survival, Faber emerges as a rather heroic figure, by turns pooterish and visionary. His letters are disarmingly candid. He confesses to Marie Stopes (in the process of declining to publish her book of poems, Love Songs for Young Lovers) that he himself has been a would-be poet, whose inspiration has withered, but that publishing modern poetry “has in some queer way satisfied my own frustrated ambition”. Eventually, in 1941, Faber did publish his collected poems they have not come down to posterity. He did make good picks, relying on Eliot’s impressive taste.When the firm announced its first three collections by new poets in 1930, one was Auden’s Poems. Eliot spotted the talents of Marianne Moore and Louis MacNeice (even though the latter had sent his poems without any covering letter or return address). The cover blurb for MacNeice’s poems epitomises the firm’s austere manner of praise: “dour without sentimentality … his work is intelligible but unpopular”. Eliot plumped for Samuel Beckett. When he was shown Hughes’s unpublished The Hawk in the Rain, he simply scrawled: “I am inclined to think that we should take this man now.”There were also mistakes. From fear of prosecution, Faber \u0026amp Faber hesitated about Ulysses, allowing the Bodley Head to get it “Feebler and Fumbler”, Joyce called the firm. Eliot turned down both George Orwell’s Down and Out in Paris and London and, later, Animal Farm. He thought the latter a “distinguished piece of writing” but worried (in 1944) whether it was “the right point of view from which to criticise the political situation at the present time”. Profitable opportunities were lost. Several letters chart the falling out with CP Snow, who was convinced that Faber was not striving sufficiently to sell his books and who patrolled London bookshops in the weeks before Christmas to see if they were stocking copies. He had the temerity to acquire an agent, who duly pressured the firm even more. Snow left, and duly produced a series of bestsellers.The blend of old-school gentility and literary adventure is epitomised by Faber director Charles Monteith. As a young fellow of All Souls (another one), he wrote out of the blue to Geoffrey Faber saying that he fancied working “in a ‘booky’ atmosphere”. A year later, he was in. Monteith became a fabled talent spotter, recovering Lord of the Flies from the slush pile. Toby Faber reproduces the letter from William Golding, a Salisbury school teacher, over which a Faber reader had written: “Rubbish \u0026amp dull. Pointless. Reject”. It is Monteith who reads three poems by Heaney in the New Statesman and duly hooks him for his first collection, published in 1966. Ditto Paul Muldoon, six years later.The funniest document in the collection is a letter from Monteith to an official at the Travellers’ Club, apologising for the unconventional garb of the poet Thom Gunn, whom he had invited to luncheon. “Since he was educated at Bedales and at Trinity College, Cambridge, I took it for granted that he would be aware of the ordinary social conventions in matters such as this.” But Gunn had been living in San Francisco and appeared in fringed leather jacket and cowboy boots.Financial calculation continued to vie with literary high-mindedness in later years. In 1981 an employee wrote a note to chairman Matthew Evans complaining about the decision to publish a Not the Nine o’Clock News spinoff annual. The firm existed “to produce books which can be considered important”. (This unacceptably frivolous publication earned the firm more than £250,000 in profits.) Extracts from board minutes show that only royalties from Cats and the Spitting Image book kept the firm going in the 1980s. Andrew Lloyd Webber may or may not have enriched the musical stage, but he has done a great service to literary publishing. • Faber \u0026amp Faber: the Untold Story by Toby Faber (RRP £20).

Pratchett’s last request to Gaiman before he died was that he adapt the novel they wrote together Gaiman wrote the screenplay andworked as showrunner on the BBCAmazon co-production, which the Radio Times called “a devilishly funny love letter to the book”.But Christians marshalled by the Return to Order campaign, an offshoot of the US Foundation for a Christian Civilisation, disagree. More than 20,000 supporters have signed a petition in which they say that Good Omens is “another step to make satanism appear normal, light and acceptable”, and “mocks God’s wisdom”. God, they complain, is “voiced by a woman” – Frances McDormand – the antichrist is a “normal kid” and, most importantly, “this type of video makes light of Truth, Error, Good and Evil, and destroys the barriers of horror that society still has for the devil”. They are calling on Netflix to cancel the show.Gaiman responded to the petition on Twitter, writing: “I love that they are going to write to Netflix to try and get #GoodOmens cancelled. Says it all really. This is so beautiful ... Promise me you won’t tell them?”The publisher and science fiction critic Cheryl Morgan tweeted: “Miraculously God has already done it. Don’t tell them She put it on Amazon instead.”Return to Order is based on the writings of the author John Horvat II. It “calls upon Americans to put principles into actions by working toward what is called an organic Christian society”.

Hundreds of millions of people disturbed by the pace of advancement in their country are turning to faith for the meaning and hope they don’t find in the radically secular world around them. This search for the sacred is shifting social structures and shaping China’s future in new and significant ways.With more than 24 million residents, Shanghai is China’s largest city and the 10th wealthiest in the world. It is famous for economic dynamism and architectural daring, and has become synonymous with consumerism. At the same time, it is at the forefront of religious resurgence. Rooted in history, this revival has swept in on the tide of globalisation, fed by the inventiveness of the Chinese people.After decades of suppression during the Mao era, the number of followers of China’s five official religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism – are steadily rising alongside a rich range of unofficial groups and alternative spiritual practices. It is a remarkable recovery, especially considering the destruction of religious infrastructure and knowledge, and continued political suppression.Shanghai Sacred explores the spaces, rituals and communities – in official, unofficial, public and private forms – that together weave the spiritual fabric of the city. Intimate photographs document the creativity of the faithful when creating ‘sacred space’ in a dense and restless urban environment.The traditional east Asian Buddhist practice of freeing captive animals to accrue good karma has flourished dramatically in recent years in Shanghai, in step with the rise of social media and online money donation, which keeps the practice afloat. Here hundreds of inhabitants gather to liberate $3,000 (£2,400) worth of fish bought from the market that morning. Monks or devout lay people organise weekly devotional gatherings, performing the ritual throughout the public space, thus creating a new economy for fishermen and a sense of belonging in an ever-changing urban environment.In 1921, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) was founded in Shanghai. This museum venerates the party and preserves the “official” memories of this occasion with a waxwork of Mao Zedong at the founding meeting. This space is part of the sacred geography of the city and a place that Chinese tourists visit in a reverent manner.The Longhua Revolutionary Martyrs’ cemetery commemorates the CCP members and other activists who died during the revolutionary struggles of 1928-37. Located on a former section of the grounds of the Longhua Buddhist temple, it is part of the “sacred geography” of Shanghai.Dongyue temple hosts one of China’s three official Taoist learning centres and has seen a resurgence of students in recent years. The male students are trained in academic subjects, such as English and history, as well as in Taoist doctrine and ritual practice. Daily meditation time in a state-of-the-art, climate-controlled room has been tacked on to the curriculum.Baiyun (white clouds) Taoist temple was originally built in 1863 just outside the walled city. In 2004, the entire temple was relocated to within the former walled city. Moving temple buildings is not uncommon in China’s radical redevelopments.Jasmine left her job as a doctor to study traditional Tibetan Buddhist therapies. She offers Tibetan bowl singing therapy to her Chinese clients at a members’ club in the centre of Shanghai. With a growing interest in different forms of Buddhist practice, her business has proved lucrative.Super Brand Mall is one of the largest shopping centres in Asia. The Chia Tai Group, its Thai developer, set up a Buddhist shrine outside the entrance. A flow of passersby perform rituals at the shrine, which are believed to have improved the mall’s business.Throughout history migrants and traders from afar have brought new ideas, language and lifestyles to Shanghai and integrated them with local customs to form distinct, syncretic cultures. A young boy of mixed Chinese and Indian parentage celebrates Diwali in the luxurious Shimao Riviera garden compound.Twice a year people come to join the residents of Jinze Town on the outskirts of Shanghai to celebrate the birthdays of local gods. Members of devotional groups of the region show their skills at inserting gongs, incense burners or fishing hooks into their forearms.Fushouyuan is a luxury cemetery park. Most Shanghainese cannot afford to buy a funerary slot here. However, another option is available: a tower in the centre of the cemetery contains cabinets, which are sold as containers for ashes.Elaborate items are made out of paper as offerings for the dead. They also reflect the values of the living. Among these offerings, the omnipresence of joss paper houses speaks of both the scarcity of housing that Shanghai experienced in the past and the rapid pace of urban transformation from the 1990s onwards.On the coldest day in Shanghai for more than 40 years, migrant workers share a hot lunch offered by the Protestant church after the Sunday service held in a factory. The dedication to their faith and sense of community, as well as the promise of a hearty bowl of noodle soup, fuelled the congregation as they stood for two hours in -8C. The church, located in an old factory, was soon after moved to make way for the construction of Shanghai Disneyland.Pastor Dai Lizen, born in 1918, is the oldest female pastor in Shanghai. In 1981, she became the first woman to be ordained in the city. She trained as a pastor before the Cultural Revolution and retrained afterwards to serve a flourishing church community. She lives in one room within the church compound.Orthodox Christianity is not one of the five recognised religions in China. Services are held in the Russian Consulate due to its extraterritoriality status. The Easter 2016 service was the first one that both foreigners and Chinese were allowed to attend.A couple practise singing before a Taizé prayer evening at a Catholic church. Such events have become popular among young Catholics, who often meet partners there. A regular singles’ day is held to encourage matchmaking within the church.St Teresa’s church is located within one of the biggest lilong (lane house compound) of Shanghai, comprising of about 700 houses. In recent years a major relocation project has left many of these structures empty. The remaining church complex contains a number of artists’ workshops, including that of a nationally renowned stained-glass artist.The Fuyou Road Mosque is the smallest of Shanghai’s mosques, constructed in 1870 during the Qing Dynasty and re-established as a thriving centre of Islamic education and prayer after the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).The faithful put their hand over a nephrite stone invested with “spiritual efficacy” at Jing’an temple. Nephrite jade was highly prized by the imperial court and thought more precious than silver or gold. It is a mineral of both secular and spiritual import.On New Year’s Eve, the Jiang family set a table in their kitchen with food and wine for their ancestors. After burning three incense sticks, leaving time for the ancestors to eat, they perform a worship ceremony (jizu) by burning handmade tin-leaf ingots (xibo).Indian Hindu woman lead an active spiritual life in Shanghai that includes Sanskrit reading classes and devotional singing groups in their homes in the Shimao Riviera garden compound. The community chose this compound because of its close proximity to the Huangpu River, channelling the pivotal role of holy waterways to Indians.The first thorough investigation of religious practices in a Chinese city, Shanghai Sacred was created collaboratively over four years by photographer and anthropologist Liz Hingley, alongside Professor Benoît Vermander, of the Xu-Ricci Dialogue Center at Fudan University and Liang Zhang, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.

Classes held in less formal settings – where people can learn and unwind – are on the riseWhen the seven McAvoy brothers set up the Seven Bro7hers Brewery in Salford Quays, they were determined to put the Manchester community at the heart of their operation. Five years later, the family business has a bar, the Beerhouse, in Ancoats, as well as the tap room attached to the brewery, with both venues hosting a range of classes – from crochet to beer yoga – on nights throughout the month.Alison Watson is part of the extended family and runs the marketing and events for Seven Bro7hers. She says: “We always intended to put the community at the centre of what we do. It might be painting classes, or our women’s institute evenings, where they teach crafts such as knitting, or educational evenings about beer-making – all of them have made us a community hub.”Evening classes have started to appear in unconventional venues just as traditional adult learning has gone through a tough period. Over the past decade, austerity slashed adult education budgets, with the Association of Colleges warning that adult education “will disappear by 2020” if the sector continues to be starved of funding. But, at the same time, booming interest in arts and crafts has seen more people looking to be taught skills in less formal settings.Lessons are popping up in cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants. Online portals such as Obby and the Indytute advertise classes in calligraphy, embroidery, origami and ukulele-playing, as well as more familiar night courses in languages, technology and business. Many of these classes are held in venues more typically thought of as places to buy a cappuccino or a glass of wine than learn new skills.As education moves out of the classroom and into the bar, the benefits to learners, the businesses that host them and the community at large can be considerable. For the venues, there is the obvious advantage of increased custom at times when trade might otherwise be slow. “Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights are good days to schedule things,” Watson says. “People don’t want a heavy night of drinking, but they’re happy to come out and try something new while they have a pint. Chances are, they may order some food while they’re here.”“For independent businesses, such as the Seven Bro7hers, having access to data is vital. By using iZettle, they can see their data in real time – including total sales and peak sales times – so that they can make smarter business decisions and schedule things such as workshops and events accordingly,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.From the punter’s point of view, they may be encouraged to try an activity – and a venue – they might otherwise have overlooked. Research by the Department for Education suggests adults can be encouraged into taking up learning if they happen across such opportunities in places they use in their everyday lives. And where is more commonplace for many people than a local pub or cafe?Gareth Shelton runs PopUp Painting, a business that hosts evenings on which participants recreate a picture by a well-known artist, such as Van Gogh, David Hockney or Banksy, under the guidance of a practising artist. Classes take place in pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels in cities including London, Birmingham, Leeds and Liverpool. “There’s a bit of fatigue these days at just going out for a drink after work – people want experiences,” Shelton says. “Many of those who come to our classes say they find it really relaxing to do something hands-on after a day working on a screen or immersed in their phone.”Business owners often approach Shelton saying they want something that sets their venue apart from others, introducing customers to them through a class in the hopes they will return at a later date. One hotel where PopUp Painting holds classes sees it as giving added value to the hotel guests. It can also help in terms of marketing, as the business can promote the events, while participants may also spread the word via their own social media.“Getting people through the door and having them come back for more is the most important thing for any business. Offering different experiences and activities is a great way to stand out from the crowd and attract people from across the local community to try out new things. They might come for the workshop but hopefully they’ll come back for the delicious pie and nice atmosphere,” says Hallett.So what sort of business is suited to running these kinds of classes? One that has the right space for the activity in question, of course. But often it is the attitude of the person in charge that is the most important thing. Shelton adds: “The attitude of the manager is everything. Yes, we need a venue that’s not too dark or noisy and that has tables for our desktop easels. But you need to work with someone who’s open-minded enough to try new things.”Watson agrees, and sees great reputational advantages to hosting classes. “It’s about sending out a message that you’re approachable as a business, both to the class organisers and to the customers,” she says. “You’re letting people come to you with ideas and letting them try them out. There isn’t really a negative about trying something new, even if it doesn’t work. You learn something every time and you’re creating a network of people. We consider the community events we hold to be an extension of our business.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb86cf47d464bcffae1f5458447e7f235c3c09f0/0_309_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0e8d1072c158534e20305af21ad92","title":"british tourists empire hotels museums","story":"Hotels and museums do their best to hide the horrors of the past from those who visit, but it needn’t be this wayOver the past few weeks, I have realised that I am the worst kind of British tourist. My crime is way worse than binge drinking in Benidorm, or mortifying locals in Rhodes with sex acts performed in front of their Orthodox chapels. I’m the party pooper who, while on holiday in destinations popular with Britons, has the audacity to ask: what actually happened here?For example, I had the good fortune to find myself in Jamaica last month after a filming stint in Kingston, when I realised that my hotel was actually named after a former slave plantation on whose grounds it still stands. That history is completely invisible to the predominantly British tourists who stay there, unless they go out of their way to visit Rose Hall, a museum on the other side of the vast estate where the owners’ “Great House” still stands.Once you get past the British couples having their wedding photos taken on the steps of this slavery HQ – a strange choice in my personal opinion – the museum’s emphasis is all on the white mistress who lived here (an alleged serial killer of her slavemaster husbands) with barely a mention of the African slaves themselves. The cell where those who attempted to escape had their legs amputated by a bear trap, and were left to bleed to death, is now a tourist toilet that the guides assure visitors is “perfectly safe to use”. Tourists are reminded, repeatedly, that this site, ground zero of one of the greatest horrors in human history – is “paradise”.If “paradise” is Jamaica, in the British tourist lexicon, then “Africa” is basically Kenya. I realised this when I visited the east African country, which attracts huge numbers of generally privileged British visitors, either gap-year students backpacking and volunteering, or people who can afford ultra-expensive safaris. The  ran a piece recently listing 18 reasons to visit Kenya, and hardly any of them had anything to do with its African inhabitants, relating predominantly to the wildlife, landscape and history of any British royalty who had deigned to visit.In the highlands – site of a massive and enduring land grab by white settlers in the early 1900s – I met a British farmer who told me that were it not for his forebears, the natives would still be spearing each other in senseless “tribal wars”, which his community generously prevented by helping themselves to hundreds of thousands of the most fertile acres, creating a system of apartheid, and amassing significant personal fortunes in the process.There is no mention of this rather crucial episode in Kenyan history if you visit Karen Blixen’s house – an eery time capsule in which the aristocratic Danish author’s memoir Out of Africa was set, where nostalgia for an era of white adventure and loyal black servitude is a key attraction for today’s British tourists. It’s not subtle. When you go to buy wooden carvings in the gift shops in Nairobi afterwards, you may even be greeted by a Maasai warrior paid to balance on one leg.Both these countries depend significantly on British tourism, and as someone who treasures having been able to witness the beauty of both their culture and landscape, the last thing I would do is disparage that. Instead, I took it upon myself to talk to the other visitors I met about the aspects of the history that were conspicuously absent from tours that have been carefully designed not to make them feel offended, guilty, or uncomfortable in any way.And do you know what I found? We underestimate the good old British holidaymaker. People who have invested the time and money in travelling to Jamaica or Kenya – let’s not forget that by far the most popular holiday destination for Britons is the far closer and more affordable Spain – are genuinely interested in learning something new. Many have an intellectual curiosity that could cope with an honest appraisal of what happened in the past and how it relates to the seemingly faraway island that they inhabit. Everyone I spoke to, during the unofficial alternative history talks that I took upon myself to deliver (I told you I’m an annoying person to meet on holiday) said how little of these events they knew, yet how interested they were to learn more.They may have been politely trying to get rid of me. But I believe there is an opportunity to be honest with and educate British tourists in parts of the former British empire, instead of which we are stuck in denial. Tour operators, hotel and museum owners think that visitors want to hear something that conforms to their already comfortable worldview. They then produce experiences that do so, and British holidaymakers come away with their preconceptions neatly confirmed.It’s hard enough to get people to think about these questions here in Britain. But if Britons are still being helped to avoid the truth of empire in the places where it happened, and where local people are still living with the consequences, then what hope have we got?"},{"url":null,"title":"it takes two creative duos on how collaboration makes them thrive","story":"Two heads are better than one, so the saying goes, and if these Coal Drops Yard pairings are anything to go by, there’s something in it …Creativity and collaboration are at the heart of Coal Drops Yard and its array of independent businesses, offering everything from bras to baguettes. We spoke to three of the district’s creative duos to get some tips on pairing up and the art of compromise.Lots of siblings wouldn’t be able to work together – have you guys always collaborated well?Mazie: We have entirely different skills, which I think is critical to us getting on. Abbie heads up design and I head up the marketing. We don’t step on each other’s toes and we trust each other’s judgments. She’s a bit more daring and I’m more commercial, so we’re a good balance.Abbie: The crossover in our pregnancies, with hormones raging, was pretty much the only time we had a row. One argument in three years of collaborating together on Beija isn’t bad, I reckon. Our working relationship improves all the time, as we gain confidence and toughen up.Has your relationship changed since you began working together?Mazie: It’s definitely stronger. She was my stroppy older sister before, but now she’s my best friend. I like to think we’ve both matured a lot since launching Beija.What do you each think the other brings to the brand?Abbie: Mazie brings so much – ideas, jokes, vision and commerciality. I can get a bit avant garde. She reins us all in.Mazie: Abbie brings gorgeous bras that women want to wear – simple styling and beautiful colours. She has great taste and won’t compromise on quality for price, which is what I really respect about her. She’s got high standards.What’s a day in the life of Beija like?Mazie: No day is the same – it’s a ride of amazing highs and frustrating lows. We’re still in our infancy, so I have a lot of jobs – a mix of copywriting, contacting buyers, planning newsletters, designing digital ads, social media, looking at fabrics, plus planning the future of Beija …Abbie: I reply to emails in the morning and do lab dips – approving and rejecting fabric colour submissions. Then I smash through patterns, make sure all the fabrics are there for cutting, so that the samples can be picked up and sewn. Measuring and fitting, then more emails and catching up with the factories. I meet with fabric suppliers, and then have meetings with my team at various points in the day. When I’m designing I have to get away from the office, as there’s no brain space with so much going on.Has Coal Drops Yard influenced your work?Mazie: I visit Coal Drops Yard twice a week and I never want to leave. It’s got a style about it that I really love – it’s laid-back and effortless. I’m always blown away by how cool and well-dressed everyone is.Abbie: The customers who shop here definitely influence us. They are pretty cool, understated and modern. And architecturally, yes. It’s a super slick, strong and neat space – all characteristics I admire and consider when I’m designing.What’s your working relationship like?Missy: In any successful relationship, work or otherwise, you have to put as much energy into understanding and knowing the other person as you do into the actual work. It’s complex being involved with your work partner in a romantic way, because sometimes you’re restricted by what they know already – about you, about the business and the way you work. Collaboration is as much about space as it is about closeness.Our ideas cross over the most in the creative, fun parts of the business, which is what we both enjoy most, but that’s not all the business is. There are a lot of times we just have to get our heads down and split the crappy jobs that no one wants to do!What do you each bring that’s unique?Gabriel: Bodega Rita’s is the product of two people with very different sensibilities and very different ways of working, and we are extremely lucky that these juxtapositions balance out in a beautiful way. It allows us to split responsibilities based on our inidual strengths, enabling us to encourage and support each other while getting on with what needs to be done.Missy: Gabe’s a brilliant chef but, more than that, he understands the importance of the experience of eating, and the transportive quality of flavour. He brings his references together in a way that is honest and thorough and not at all pretentious, and translates food that belongs in a restaurant into a tiny grab-and-go sandwich shop with eight seats.Has your store been influenced by its Coal Drops Yard location?Missy: The power of food is that it’s unifying, so we are absolutely influenced not only by the history of the area but the fact that it’s a workplace for some people, a day out for others, a place of study … I’m looking forward to summer when we can keep the front doors open, have music playing and create a lovely hangout spot for people visiting the area.What advice would you give to someone embarking on a creative collaboration with someone they’re in a relationship with?Gabriel: Work out your inidual strengths and respect them. Communicate and support each other. And always make time to do stuff together that has absolutely nothing to do with work – regularly. Don’t let work get in the way.How did you become business partners?Joao: We have been mates for a long time and we both share the same love and respect for the craft of tattooing and the piercing industry. Sacred Gold was the perfect opportunity to join forces and create something special.What’s a typical day in the life of Sacred Gold?Guy: Adorning lots of people from all walks of life. From mild to wild, discreet to ostentatious, we have something for everyone.What do you think each other brings to the business?Joao: Guy has a lot of experience and insight into the management and approach of running a studio, and a business awareness that benefits us greatly.Guy: Joao has a very unique style that is instantly recognisable. His tattoos are extremely hard to duplicate, creating something special and exclusive to Sacred Gold.What advice would you give someone starting a creative collaboration with a friend?Joao: I would say a successful partnership consists of friends who have opposing qualities. Guy and I have different strengths, so we can both bring something different to the table and balance each other out.Guy: Collaboration means bouncing ideas off one another and expanding on them. Seeing things from a different set of eyes can really expand an idea. A different perspective can also be refreshing and can help when an idea feels stagnant.Has Coal Drops Yard inspired your work?Joao: It’s been an influence on the interior of the studio. We wanted to reflect the way Coal Drops Yard has held on to the historical structure while adding modern elements.Guy: I think what influenced us the most was the style and high spec of Coal Drops Yard – we knew we had to do something that would do justice to such an incredible project.Looking for a more personal shopping and dining experience, or simply want to discover somewhere new in the capital?

Poland and the Czech Republic are understood to be holding out against the 2050 target but Slovakia has dropped its opposition, splitting the central European Visegrád group.“We still do not have unanimity, but an overwhelming majority of member states, including member states you would never expect of being ready to accept such an objective are going in that direction,” the diplomat said.Other sources said it was unlikely the EU would agree a 2050 net zero emissions target, which is supported by at least 18 countries, including the biggest economies, the UK, France and Germany.But diplomats hope the EU can make this pledge as part of a long-term strategy, which will be submitted to the United Nations in early 2020.The EU, which likes to vaunt its green credentials, is under pressure to pledge a net-zero carbon emissions goal in 2050 before a crucial United Nations climate action summit in September. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants the summit to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C – a non-binding aspiration of the 2015 Paris accord.Guterres wrote to European council president, Donald Tusk, last month calling on him “demonstrate the leadership” of the EU. “I write to you today both as a G20 member and as a leader who I believe can bring the ingenuity needed to transform our economic systems and avert the negative impacts of a world with high levels of carbon emissions – from rising levels of pollution to costly natural disasters,” he stated.The letter calls for a change of course to “achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050” and specifies that leaders should curtail current coal-burning power stations and discontinue new ones beyond 2020.Green campaigners are calling on the EU to make a clear 2050 pledge at Thursday’s summit.“Weasel words won’t defuse the climate emergency time bomb,” Greenpeace EU climate policy adviser Sebastian Mang said. “With people clamouring for a political response and a call for urgent action from scientists, European leaders are under pressure to show that they will do what it takes. They need to set Europe on a rapid path to full decarbonisation and make this a turning point in the global response to the climate crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9729a71a4557284a3b69bdfdcfc22e13b359a7d3/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337cbe87630bbe63253a7234ff2ffe85","title":"sadiq khan announces car free day in london to tackle air pollution","story":"Event will take place on 22 September across 18 boroughs, with road closures and eventsSadiq Khan has announced plans to implement London’s biggest car-free day to date, closing 12.3 miles (20km) of roads in the centre of the capital in September.Roads will be closed for the event around London Bridge, Tower Bridge and much of the City of London to help tackle the capital’s air pollution crisis, which kills thousands of people each year and leaves two million – including 400,000 children – living in areas with illegally dirty air.Boroughs across the city will also hold events promoting walking, cycling and public transport, as well as creating scores of “play streets”.It is the first time a London mayor has closed down large sections of roads in the city centre. Khan said the day would offer an opportunity for people to leave their cars behind and explore streets by foot or by bike.“I encourage as many Londoners as possible to join in the fun and see the city from a different perspective,” he said.The event, which will take place on 22 September, has been given a cautious welcome by campaigners.Areeba Hamid of Greenpeace UK said: “It’s exciting to see London adopting the idea of having a car-free day, something great cities across the world from Paris to Bogotá have been giving a try … Reducing toxic air pollution and carbon emissions are vital, but they are far from the only benefit of reclaiming our streets.”Dr Audrey de Nazelle, an academic at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London, said the event was important to show people how enjoyable a car-free city would be.“Being aware of the scale of air pollution health problems is not enough. Actually living the joys of a car-free or carless city will do much more to create a positive vision of what a future healthy London could be like,” she said.Hundreds of activities will take place across the closed streets in central London, with 18 boroughs planning to work with residents to create play streets for children, where communities can get together. It is hoped more than 150,000 Londoners will join in.The move comes as concerns mount about the impact of the UK’s poisonous air, which causes 40,000 early deaths a year.Last year, an unprecedented joint inquiry by MPs described air pollution as a “national health emergency”. Their report was scathing about the government’s clean air plans, which have been judged illegal three times in the high court. The latest proposal, rejected by the court, was described as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors.London’s air pollution crisis is responsible for 9,000 early deaths each year. The scale of the problem was laid bare with figures showing every person in the capital breathes air that exceeds global guidelines for one of the most dangerous toxic particles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32ab211de7c983596e6d0593565ea399dace400/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7ede9b31e0f93d904c9bd02e2fa384","title":"uk citizens assembly on climate emergency announced","story":"MPs launch assembly plan but environmental activists say its conclusions must be bindingA citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency will take place this autumn to explore the fastest and fairest ways to end the UK’s carbon emissions.Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed.However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly’s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand – action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 – has not been met.Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so.A citizens’ assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined.“This isn’t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,” said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee.She said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. “I hope the citizens’ assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support – even demand – for the government to take the action necessary,” she said.Greg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens’ assembly. “Initiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,” he said.But Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We have a citizens’ assembly that will give recommendations. Everyone knows what that means, which is it will come out with some ideas and get ignored, like people have been ignored for the last 30 years.”“If you are going to do a citizens’ assembly it has to have teeth and be legally binding,” he said. “We are facing a dire existential emergency. It’s what the UN is saying, what scientists are saying – the only people who haven’t taken it on board are politicians around the world.”Cutting emissions to zero will require the further introduction of renewable energy and electric cars, the end of gas heating and cooking in homes, restrained flying and meat-eating and the planting of 1.5bn trees to absorb any remaining carbon dioxide. But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair.Extinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens’ assembly.Areeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The citizens’ assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation. Will ministers be forced to take its conclusions into account or will they be able to brush them aside as they have done with countless consultations before? The solutions to tackle the climate emergency have been around for decades – what’s been lacking is the political will to make it happen.”The House of Commons select committees organising the citizens assembly are BEIS, environmental audit, housing, communities and local government, science and technology, transport and treasury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

Here, its co-founder, Sébastien Kopp, files his travelogue from a trip to Amazonia where the shoes are madeby Sébastien Kopp photographs by  Jonny WeeksWe started working in Amazonia, in the Brazilian state of Acre, in 2004. Acre is a frontier: the last point before the Amazon rainforest begins. From Rio Branco, the state capital, it’s a few hours’ drive to get to the forest and, on the way, it becomes clear just how big a problem deforestation is. Where once there was forest, there is now field upon field of cattle and the opposition between the forest protectors and cattle farmers here has been an ongoing issue for the last 40 years.The legacy of Chico Mendes, the Brazilian environmentalist and trade union leader who was killed by a rancher in 1988, is still close to the cause. We started working with Bia Saldanha, who could almost be considered one of Mendes’s spiritual daughters, in 2008 and her experience has brought a lot to the Veja project in Amazonia. She has devoted her life to the fight for the forest and we love having her work with us.We buy wild rubber from communities of rubber tappers whom we work with inside the Amazon rainforest. The rubber is tapped directly from the Hevea trees that grow here. The rubber tappers are increasingly aware of the fact that they can be s of this immensely important forest. Every time we visit, we have open meetings with the community to help us understand how we can do better for them and the forest.On this trip, we discussed a premium cost that we recently added to every kilo of rubber, which specifically goes towards protecting the forest. They told us how a lot of the younger rubber tappers have realised they can now make more money through their work with us than raising cattle. This makes me so happy and I told them that in each pair of our shoes there is a piece of them, there is a piece of the forest.A typical day for a seringueiro (the Brazilian name for a rubber tapper) usually starts at 4am, when they head out on their forest trails to extract and collect rubber milk from the Hevea trees.A seringueiro normally collects 10 litres of rubber milk a day, which we use for the soles of Veja sneakers. Through this process, we are able to support the working communities here and protect the forest from being cut down.The rubber tappers are the first to see the impact that climate change has on the Amazon rainforest the rivers that are drying up fires that didn’t exist before. They share their hopes for a sustainable future here and ask if there are more companies like Veja that can help to avoid deforestation by working with the amazing wealth of the forest without destroying it.The rubber tappers can be the destroyers or s of the forest: we try to push them towards being its s. Sebastiao, one of the leaders in the community, insisted on showing us the Hevea tree plantation he has created on previously deforested land that was used for cattle farming.Every time we come to visit, we are welcomed by such amazing people. We sleep in hammocks and are treated to the most beautiful sunsets and delicious breakfasts. On this trip, we were welcomed by Senhora Conda. She told us all about the work she and her husband do as teachers to the children who live in the forest. She talked about what is changing here, both good and bad. They tell us their stories, their dreams and their difficulties.Our team in Brazil is made up of 25 talented people. They are shoe-makers, specialists in research and development of material and logistics managers who handle our complex production chain, from the ecological raw materials such as organic cotton or wild rubber that we use to make the shoes. In 2019, we have bought almost 200 tons of each. The collection is designed in Paris and brought to life in Brazil.We have a lot of exciting projects coming up and the team is always busy, researching and looking for more ecological raw materials and fabrics. Veja is becoming a test lab for innovations.

Sooner or later, humanity is bound to create an artificial intelligence that decides it no longer needs us, and that it would make a better  of the Earth than us.

Where in the 1980s and 90s, the Alien and Terminator sagas drove all before them, creating, or at least popularising, many of the concepts that still run through their celluloid successors today, in the 21st century they have dwindled into dollar-strewing automata for the Hollywood machine. All the interesting ideas seem to be on the small screen, in shows such as Black Mirror, or independent cinema such as the recent Netflix hits I Am Mother or See You Yesterday. Blade Runner 2049, from 2017, is perhaps the last great example of futuristic cinema as spectacle to truly resonate, and it struggled badly at the box office.In October, we will be treated to Terminator: Dark Fate, the latest instalment in the long-running man v machines saga, directed by Deadpool’s Tim Miller, and it may well be the one that resets the timeline and puts everything back on track. The trailers look cool, but all they really tell us is that Arnie looks dandy with a beard.Even if Dark Fate does turn out to be a bravura return to the world of the Terminator, it is unlikely to tread much ground we haven’t already seen trodden many times before. The bit in the trailer in which the new Rev-9 Terminator separates its skin from its metal carapace and reforms it into another humanoid shape is a new development (even if it makes no sense at all and breaks all the laws of physics). But the movie looks to be doing most of the same things that Terminator movies have been doing since T2: Judgment Day in 1991: there are guns, robots and high-speed chases involving huge pieces of machinery. Arnie is still somehow around, even though we swear we’ve seen him lowered into molten steel at least a half-dozen times, and even Edward Furlong’s version of John Connor may return, via the magic of CGI “ghosting” tech.Where are the new ideas? And isn’t there an obvious solution? Imagine if Netflix were to announce it had commissioned a Black Mirror-style anthology series to accompany Dark Fate, all written and directed by indie sci-fi luminaries such as Moon’s Duncan Jones (who surely deserves another chance despite the god-awful Mute), I Am Mother’s Grant Sputore and Ex Machina’s Alex Garland. The series could be used to inspire new concepts in future big-screen episodes, so we don’t all end up with the nagging feeling that we’ve seen this one before somewhere in an alternate timeline.Disney is using a similar concept to reignite Star Wars, presumably aware that the grand old space opera saga can’t keep recycling the original trilogy’s tropes for ever. The Mandalorian, about a bounty hunter from the same planet as Boba Fett, will be among the first shows to debut on the new Disney+ streaming service later this year, where it will eventually be joined by a Star Wars prequel series based on Rogue One, starring Diego Luna, as well as Avengers and Marvel Cinematic Universe spin-offs such as WandaVision and an as-yet-untitled Loki project. The Star Wars shows should sate the desires of fans who don’t want to wait three years between big-screen episodes, but they are also likely to freshen up their celluloid counterparts – especially as there is every indication that Disney does not see these small screen spin-offs as mere easy, cheap cash-ins.So why not take the same approach with Terminator, or Alien? The “cinematic universe” may have dwindled in popularity now everyone has worked out it isn’t as easy as Marvel makes it look, but there remains a hunger for interconnected stories that isn’t likely to go away just because Warner Bros and Universal dropped the ball on their mooted DC and Universal Monsters franchises.Watching I Am Mother, Sputore’s remarkable vision of AI as an untrustworthy keeper of post-apocalyptic humanity’s enduring flame, I half-expected to spot Easter eggs showing that the world of Mother and Daughter was somehow connected to Terminator. And Ex Machina might easily have worked as an alternative origins story for Cameron’s franchise, too. It’s not difficult to imagine both films as calling cards left for the money men behind Alien and Terminator, to persuade them to hand their creators the keys to a larger kingdom.So bring them in: change the picture, expand the canvas. And while you’re at it Hollywood, please let Neill Blomkamp make his long-lost Aliens movie, especially now Ridley Scott has so clearly run out of ideas. The alternative is that the kind of blockbuster dystopian sci-fi that Scott and Cameron so successfully introduced to the world more than three decades ago will soon be facing its very own extinction event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3956e7aff8c8cd5c575079dd30ab3f07e67aa12f/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b656ec17624e020836a253c6b5937cf","title":"mmm bap the long search for the perfect burger bun","story":"Every year since the 70s the burger bun has got fluffier, sweeter and more golden – from a squidgy, dull bap to a gleaming brioche. But where will it go from here?This is going to sound like a dream I had, but it’s true: I once travelled 200 miles to taste a “doughnut burger”. Instead of just one patty of ground meat, there were two, with bacon and untold gunk in between. More to the point, instead of a bun, there was a doughnut. The story was that there were as many calories as you ought to eat in a day, in this single burger, so how would you feel at the end of one of those?The answer is, I felt fine. But the journey of the burger bun mystified me. Every year since the mid-70s, it has got higher, fluffier, more golden – unless it is charcoal, in which case it has got more sinister. Every year it has looked more like a gourmet item in its own right. And this increasing perfection has gone hand in hand with sweetness, so that you end up with a bun that is basically not very bread-like, that you would hesitate to eat at home because you would be thrown into confusion about whether you were having breakfast or high tea.Most of the buns you find in shops and supermarkets remain old school – bready, not especially fluffy, extremely yielding in the hand. I love them for madeleine reasons: they remind me of other times I’ve tasted them, very often in a garden, with people I am fond of. Domestically, you mostly serve burgers to people you like. They’re food for intimates, because you’re going to eat them with your hands and they will probably fall apart.In pubs and restaurants, though, buns have gone full million-dollar smile. The original pub buns were highly processed, never went stale, tasted of nothing and were squidgy. I had nothing against these buns I still don’t mind a Wimpy. But what they didn’t have was integrity: the bread changed composition on contact with the meat, became a kind of slick starchy layer. The old outrage of the 20th century – how food looked in adverts versus how it looked in real life – was largely down to these buns. They weren’t pillowy and didn’t gleam. But pubs used them for years, following the not-broke-so-don’t-fix-it module on their MBAs.The quest for the perfect bun was always more fevered in the US, possibly because the burgers were bigger. By 2009, they were havering between the potato-starch roll – still the Shake Shack staple – and a cross between challah and a breakfast roll, which is basically on its way to the brioche. Over the same period in the UK, Byron Burger was launching and Meat Liquor was finding its feet, and both went through existential self-reflection on the matter of the bun. Brioche seemed very sweet for the everyday palate.Then came Young’s “standard brioche”, devised by the pub chain and the Bread Factory bakery, and now the staple of most large pub chains. Oisin Rogers, a long-serving Young’s landlord, describes its traits: glazed top, the colour of an expensive person’s tan, “lots of sugar, can’t freeze it, can’t keep it for longer than a day, costs a lot”. Inspired by both challah (whose complication is eggs) and the pretzel bun (which has syrup and butter), it had a ton of ingredients.Two things happened: first, this bumped the price of burgers closer to a tenner than to a fiver second, they became cosmically delicious to look at, right at the point when people started taking photos of their food. Overnight, the burger became expensive enough to invite discernment, gorgeous enough to be part of your aspirational lifestyle, eventful enough to have on a date.By 2012, the Ship in Wandsworth, which Rogers was then running, was shifting 50,000 burgers in a year. It’s a large boozer, but by any kind of maths, the majority of people who walked in were ordering a burger, and some people had two. The evolution from the 90s – when a pub burger started entirely in the freezer and popped out whole from the microwave – had happened mainly in the bun. There aren’t that many decisions you can make about meat, beyond good quality or bad, rough chopped or minced, medium or rare.I still wouldn’t choose this bun at home: it’s just too sweet. You might as well put raisins on your meat. But I do admire the statement way it looks, and will often choose the fancy – sesame seeds or a glaze – over the plain.On the face of it, bun creativity has ground to a halt: there’s just a lot of monkeying about with colour, to bring us the entirely black charcoal bun or the sort of green avocado bun. Charcoal is actually completely inoffensive, except for its colour, which is its talking point, and the medical claims it makes to alleviate hangovers by soaking up toxins, which are simply … I don’t even want to dignify them with a word like “wrong”.“A burger in a restaurant has to have a narrative,” Rogers says. “So fair play to whoever came up with the charcoal bun or the avocado bun, because people need to come out and tell a story about where they spent their 12 quid.” He is convinced that the brioche will have been supplanted in five years, and, if forced to make a prediction, I would bank on the end of sugar and a return to the days when the main thing you could taste was salt – a bun that reminds you of bread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7bf7c7de93da287e2f24330e99d136a8fedbd8/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8766ec9ac5ba39f455cd6e04ae4e2","title":"the great british tea test which part of the country brings us the very best brew","story":"As a proud Lancastrian, I ought to favour my local blend in a taste test with rivals from Yorkshire and beyond. However …I made the mistake of buying some Lancashire Tea bags recently. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I was born in Lancaster – and they were on offer in Morrisons.What a disappointment. We Lancastrians may have won the Wars of the Roses* and be vastly better at football than our transpennine rivals, but, by ’eck, the brew bearing my county’s name is an insipid affair. More than once I had to go back to the cupboard and check I hadn’t picked up a decaf bag in error. Lancashire Tea is murky. It has a sinister tinge of that slightly bruised purple you get when suffering a tea with the good stuff removed.Chances are, you have never tried Lancashire Tea. You probably didn’t even know it was a thing. It has only existed since 2002, when Paul Needham and Lynn Hitchen looked enviously at the success of Yorkshire Tea and decided to copy the gimmick over on the rainy side of the M62.It is, I would argue, a bit of a swizz. The website gives little away, but moderate sleuthing reveals it is not even boxed in Lancashire. They blend it in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, which hasn’t been in Lancashire since 1974. I guess Merseyside Tea doesn’t carry convey quite the same romance.It was all excellent viral marketing for Yorkshire Tea, which used the resulting publicity to clarify that the tea is in fact only blended in Yorkshire, before being shipped around the country.Despite living in Stockport (the west, correct, side of the Pennines), I drink Yorkshire Tea. It’s strong and northern, like me. We don’t even keep it local in the ’s Manchester office, despite the paper’s 198-year foundations in the historic county of Lancashire. We too buy the Tykes’ tea, in 3kg sacks from our stationery supplier.But is Yorkshire Tea really the nation’s finest mass-produced regional chai? I decided to find out, with the help of Jimmy Green, an ex-military man who became addicted to tea when serving in Hong Kong alongside teetotal Gurkhas. He runs Tea from the Manor, which blends loose-leaf teas for hotels across the north-west.He invites me to his office, in an unpromising oblong building on an industrial estate in Denton, Greater Manchester. Appearances deceive. Inside is a tea lover’s paradise. His desk is made of tea chests and two walls are packed floor-to-ceiling with his blends, which include everything from traditional oolong (a superstrong Chinese number only for the hardcore) to a gin and tonic concoction he had made recently for some Cheshire hipsters.A brew with Green is a formal affair. I immediately feel underdressed. He is wearing a dickie bow and pristine white shirt and boils water not in a kettle but in a shiny samovar. Cups are china, naturally, and he has put on a tantalising spread of chocolate eclairs and slices of Victoria sponge that he forbids me from touching until after the tasting, lest I sully my palate.He has laid out some tea leaves on a saucer. One pile, fine brown shavings, he dismisses as “dust”. That, he says, is what we will find inside all the tea bags we are to test today – blends, he suggests, that are fine only in texture. Cheap and tawdry, lowest common denominator stuff. He wants me to compare the dust with the much bigger dried tea leaves he puts into Tea from the Manor blends, which he insists will impart vastly more flavour.I line up the teas we are to taste: Yorkshire Tea, Lancashire Tea, Cornish Tea, West Country Tea, Welsh Tea and Ringtons (which trades heavily on its Newcastle-upon-Tyne origins), plus the only tea I could find that is grown wholly in Britain: Kinnettles Gold, propagated and hand-rolled on a farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, in such tiny quantities that they produce no more than 2kg a year.Green is not keen to taste these heathen teas: “It’s like asking someone used to drinking fine wines to have a bottle of cheap cider.” Nonetheless, he forces down a few mouthfuls, grimacing as if I have made him drink meths. He complains of a “furry taste” (Ringtons), being left with a coating on his tongue (Cornish) and points out some white scum that gathers in the Yorkshire bag. We decide to make each cuppa as I would at home or in the office: straight into the cup. We are not to stir – or worse, use a teaspoon to squeeze out the flavour: “Stirring it is wrong. We should let it steep itself.”I can’t tell the difference between most of them – apart from the fairy-light and appleish Kinnettles, which isn’t an English Breakfast blend and really belongs in a totally different category. I decide I like Ringtons best: it is neither baggy nor crepy and has slightly smoky overtones. Yorkshire and Welsh are pretty much interchangeable: a discovery confirmed by blind tastings in the ’s Manchester office, where even proud Bradfordian Josh Halliday, a lifelong Yorkshire Tea drinker, was fooled by its Welsh brethren.Nazia Parveen, a Brummie, manages to distinguish northern from southern. We all agree the Cornish and West Country brews are a bit too light for our unsubtle palates. It could be the water: ours in Manchester is soft and might not bring out the best in teas blended in England’s lower half. That said, most tea blenders import water from across the UK to check their product will still be drinkable outside their home region.Back at Tea from the Manor, Green reluctantly tastes a sip of Lancashire. He rolls out another simile to explain the offence I am causing his taste buds – “It’s like making a Bugatti owner drive a Transit van” – and makes a face. “Not nice.” He prefers its transpennine rival, too, not that you would ever catch him drinking mass-produced “dust” on his own time.But before Yorkshire folk get too cocky, their brew didn’t come out top in my tasting test. That honour went to Ringtons of Newcastle. Forget the Wars of the Roses: the Geordies win the ’s tea tussle.* Don’t bother the readers’ editor with this one, Yorkshire chums. Yes, there were several wars, not one, and you won a few. But the last one ended when Henry Tudor (later Henry VII), a Lancastrian, defeated and killed Yorkie Richard III (the car park king) at Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485. So we won.Yorkshire Tea (£2.79 for 80 teabags) A no-nonsense brew, befitting a county that gave us Geoffrey Boycott and Sean Bean. Like a Yorkshire terrier: feisty but reliable and surprisingly domineering. 45Cornish Tea (£2.99 for 80 teabags) Pleasant enough but lacking in personality. I was expecting more subversion from a tea with the subtitle “smuggler’s brew”. 35Welsh Brew Gold (£3.69 for 80 teabags) A hearty brew – strong and confident, yet strangely comforting, like a male voice choir. Can double for Yorkshire Tea. 45Ringtons Gold (£3.97 for 100 teabags) Blended on Tyneside since 1907, Ringtons is my fave: a slightly smoky brew with a bright and golden hue. 55Miles West Country Original (£2.50 for 80 teabags) Barely there. Disappointing for a region famed for its cream teas and Cheddar cheese. 35Lancashire Tea (£2.30 for 80 teabags) Odd purplish hue. As satisfying as a weak handshake. Very “meh” for the county of strong women like Thora Hird, Emmeline Pankhurst and Barbara Castle. 25Kinnettles Gold (£40 for a 20g tin) Grown and hand-rolled on Kinnettles farm in Angus, north-east Scotland, this delicate yellow-green tea bears no relation to any of the above but scores highly for refreshment and novelty value. 45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74b6928638e1f5d9524f48d35b1755e6a5d83291/71_0_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c38b0e2b21537afb58c6c935c3f8fb","title":"argentina messi copa america leadership finances talent","story":"The only positive for Argentina, and it is a dubious one, is that it could have been worse. A draw against Paraguay means they will probably advance to the quarter-final of the Copa América if they beat Qatar on Sunday – but there are no guarantees either that four points will be enough even for a best third-placed finish or, on current form, that they will beat the Asian champions. This was an extremely fortuitous point after another dismal performance.Again, Argentina were painfully disjointed. Again, it was almost impossible to discern a plan. Again, there was little attacking flair and panic at every counter. Little wonder Sergio Agüero and Nicolás Otamendi have gone grey with the stress.That Argentina did not repeat their opening defeat was down largely to two moments of fortune. First, the very modern penalty they were awarded, and that Lionel Messi converted, after Lautaro Martínez’s shot brushed an arm of Iván Piris before striking the crossbar, an offence so meagre not a single Argentinian appealed and most looked bewildered as the referee stopped them taking a corner to check the replay. If HotSpot or Snicko haven’t yet been added to the VAR toolkit, it can only be a matter of time.Then, Derlis González saw his penalty saved by Franco Armani. It’s not the most significant detail, but it was mystifying that whereas Piris was booked for having an arm, Otamendi got away without a yellow card for chopping down González as the forward spun away from him in the box. That became significant in the 83rd minute as Otamendi was booked for a wild lunge Paraguay should have had 14 minutes (thanks to the VAR-induced stoppage time) with an extra man. The result may have been better but this was arguably a worse Argentina performance than in the 2-0 defeat by Colombia.It would be absurd to blame the caretaker coach Lionel Scaloni, the latest patsy to be shoved into the spotlight. If he is not grimly sweating on the touchline as his predecessor, Jorge Sampoli, did, watching in helpless horror as his reputation collapses around him, it is probably only because he doesn’t have a reputation to collapse.What manner of shambles is it that has allowed a country that in the past year has produced the managers of both Copa Libertadores finalists and one of the Champions League finalists, the manager of the previous season’s Europa League and Copa Sudamericana winners and five managers at last summer’s World Cup to go into this tournament with someone who had never taken charge of a competitive fixture? Scaloni may develop but at the moment he is probably only the third-best Argentinian coach at this Copa América.And then there is the awkward issue of Messi, whose quest to end Argentina’s 26 years of drought and win a senior international trophy has become the defining narrative of his national side. He is brilliant, clearly, and has dragged Argentina to what heights they have reached recently. Last time Argentina faced Paraguay in the Copa América, in the semi-final four years ago, he played a part in the buildup to all six Argentina goals and, at one point, left three defenders neatly stacked on top of each other after a body swerve.Yet he also is a complication. He has followed the path beaten by Cristiano Ronaldo in doing less and less as his career has gone on to become a player far removed from the willing presser of a decade ago (in 2009-10 he won the ball back through tackles and interceptions 2.1 times per game in the league last season it was 0.5). Perhaps that is only reasonable as age begins to drag at his 31-year-old legs perhaps the lack of other responsibilities enhances his creative output. But as with Ronaldo, such focus comes at a cost to the rest of the side.It’s not just that the psychological urge to give the ball to the star – as outlined by Paulo Dybala – becomes a tactical imperative that leads to predictability, it’s that his lack of defensive work inhibits everybody else as they pick up the slack, which can lead to rigidity and tentativeness. A club as good as Barcelona, for whom domination of possession is habitual, can, to an extent, cater for that, although as Liverpool showed even Barça can flounder against teams who call their bluff, don’t sit deep and don’t devote multiple players to trying to stop Messi.But what can Argentina do? Whatever difficulties Messi poses, he is not the fundamental problem. Rather the inability to resolve the Messi conundrum highlights all the other issues around the squad: the lack of leadership, the lack of financial resources, the sense that other countries are benefiting from their coaching expertise and the diminishing pool of high-class players.And that, perhaps, is the biggest worry for Argentina. For a quarter of a century the question has been why, when they had so many gifted players, have they never won anything. That has now subtly changed: how, when they have so few gifted players, can they ever win anything?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6a19ddeafa8c7b955195bc50ba33673f8a5c49/599_64_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82421adc4e08d36c1bd10a7ee8c86f9","title":"maurizio sarri juventus fans napoli chelsea","story":"Maurizio Sarri accepted on his unveiling as Juventus manager that he will have to win over some of his new club’s fans because of his association with their Serie A rivals Napoli.Sarri appeared undaunted by the prospect of building on the work of Massimiliano Allegri, who led the club to five consecutive titles – a run that stretches to eight altogether. “I have never seen so much determination on the part of a club to hire a coach,” he said. “They had a great attitude which convinced me, they were very strong feelings.

We’re halfway there. WHOAAHH! Livin’ on a prayer!” bellow a stadium full of voices, emitting an eardrum-tickling racket at least as loud as when Liverpool FC recently became Champions League winners. Singer Jon Bon Jovi hasn’t been Livin’ on a Prayer himself for a very long time – the band’s tours gross upwards of $100m – but the 1986 smash is typical of the way the rockers turned blue collar sentiments into wedding disco ubiquities. Thirty-five years since Bon Jovi blazed out of New Jersey, they continue to inspire tribute bands such as the marvellously named By Jovi and have joined the small elite – U2 and the Rolling Stones among them – who tour stadiums, not arenas.Indeed, there is a bit of Sir Mick Jagger about the way the band’s 57-year-old frontman bounds on – all designer rocker clobber, glistening dental work and Theresa May thatch – and immediately launches into aerobic moves and camera-friendly air punches.JBJ sings Raise Your Hands and everyone does: an entire football pitch and three stands’ worth. Playing in Liverpool for the first time in 29 years, the singer purrs about the “sacred ground of Anfield” and there’s another mighty roar, albeit peppered with comedy boos from Evertonians and non-believers.Visually, it’s an impressive spectacle musically, less so. JBJ’s gravel tones are not quite what they were. He spends much of the gig rooted at the microphone stand, concentrating to hit notes he once did with one arm around (now departed) guitarist and fellow poodle hair criminal Richie Sambora. At times, the sound is truly dreadful, which isn’t a problem when You Give Love a Bad Name is bellowed by the crowd, but the lesser known Born to Be My Baby and Have a Nice Day are lost in Anfield’s natural bass and echo.Like the Stones, though, Bon Jovi understand that while audiences will tolerate new material, they’re really here for those copper-bottomed smashes, so the setlist is packed with holler-friendly choices from benchmark 80s albums Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. JBJ may joke about their hair-metal period (“When I had hair down here and tighter jeans”) although big chorused debut single Runaway – about an unloved girl who falls into prostitution – suggests that Bon Jovi were always more pop-rock than metal.As darkness descends, the sound improves and JBJ draws on years of experience and a formidable force of will to gradually provide the expected stadium rock experience. When I’ll Be There for You swaggers like vintage Faces, the singer seizes on the moment, conducting a vast crowd a capella chorus that just keeps going.Listening to a 57-year-old man sing “I’m a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride” (presumably not the No 6 bus from Bootle) involves a certain suspension of disbelief, but pop always offered an escape from reality. There’s no Always or Blaze of Glory, but Bad Medicine is still stupidly anthemic and Lay Your Hands on Me seems to attempt the world record number of “Whoah whoah”s. A Beatles medley – Birthday and Twist and Shout – provides the kind of surprise, ragged, loose-limbed fun you don’t often get in stadium gigs and that cathartic eruption for Livin’ on a Prayer ensures that even some distance from their heyday, Bon Jovi will never walk alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e1fa9af5b5f7a63eb4dbde9fcee0d72676a048/0_70_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2482c53add377c83b52f14beca191544","title":"the rehabilitation of tony blair","story":"Tony Blair’s legacy since leaving office has been the subject of heated debate both within the Labour party and the country at large.

None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

However, he died before he could spend the money and it was used instead to pay for his funeral.After his death, two letters from two different doctors which were ignored by the DWP, were published by the Liverpool Echo.One note, written by Dr Terence Crowley, stated that Smith “could not mobilise a distance of twenty metres repeatedly without needing to stop due to pain and breathlessness”.Amid widespread condemnation of the department’s treatment of Smith, the MP for Birkenhead, Frank Field, wrote in April to the DWP secretary, Amber Rudd, to call for an official inquiry into his case.Rudd, who refused to grant a full inquiry, instead ordered an internal DWP review. Writing to Field to reveal its results, she said: “Whilst the policy guidance was followed in Mr Smith’s case, there were crucial safeguarding opportunities which were missed by the department. The review has identified areas where we need to change our policy and we will be implementing these changes to ensure our most vulnerable claimants are protected.“The department will be working at pace to ensure that these are embedded and that vulnerable claimants are receiving the best possible support from the department. I am adamant that we will learn important lessons from this tragic case and make changes to protect people like Mr Smith in future.”Among the jargon-heavy changes Rudd outlined were improving awareness of how changes to benefit entitlement could affect other benefits in payment or under appeal and “identifying other trigger points for information sharing between benefit lines to improve, join up and provide more holistic support”.In response to the letter, Field said: “What kind of policy guidance is it that fails to recognise that somebody is seriously ill and dying? “This letter heavily disguises the fact that we’re talking about a man who lost his life, not a package that got lost within the DWP. It sums up much of what’s wrong with the DWP which is apparently very short on human sympathy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/569639abaebe5892b6634a03a537f78e68e0ae88/266_590_5203_3122/master/5203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95ab0b498c750eefaf313e7d6ae9ed04","title":"fernando alonso le mans motor sport","story":"Spaniard joins an illustrious list but leaves endurance racing as organisers are eager to revitalise and level playing fieldAfter victory on Sunday at the Le Mans 24 hours Fernando Alonso left the Circuit de la Sarthe having joined a very select club. With his win last year at the first attempt, the Spaniard, who is now leaving endurance racing, joins Woolf Barnato and Jean-Pierre Wimille as the only multiple Le Mans winners who remain unbeaten at the race.Alonso leaves on a high, albeit an unexpected one after an unlikely win. Yet for many drivers, among them Britain’s Nick Tandy who won here in 2015, stepping away from Le Mans is almost unthinkable. Alonso may not be there for it but Tandy doubtless will be as the race looks to embrace a new future.Alonso won alongside Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima for Toyota, beating their sister No 7 car driven by Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and José María López into second. It was a two-horse race with Toyota, the only manufacturer in the top LMP1 hybrid class, and Alonso’s squad did not have the better of it.The No 7 had been on top for almost 23 hours, with a two-minute advantage when a tyre sensor indicated a front-right puncture. The crew brought the car in, changed the tyre only to find the sensor had been wrong and it was the left rear losing pressure. Another stop ensued and López, who admitted he was in tears, lost the lead and the race.Alonso had the good grace to say the win belonged to the sister car. “It was a shocking race,” he said. “We didn’t have the pace to win the race, the No7 car was quicker than us and we didn’t deserve the victory maybe, but we were lucky.”He did note, however, that he felt he was due some positive racing karma. “On other occasions it took us off some F1 championships and they are tough moments when you are on one side and happy moments when you are on the other side. The good luck was on our side but other races or F1 championships were gone inexplicably and we have to enjoy being on this side.”Quite whether Conway, Kobayashi and López felt that the double F1 world champion deserved this particular piece of fortune seems unlikely. Their disbelief and disappointment was painful to behold.Still, that Alonso is unbeaten is what the record books will show, a feat not achieved for some time. Britain’s Barnato, one of the Bentley Boys, won Le Mans three times between 1928 and 1930, while France’s Wimille won in 1937 and 1939 driving a Bugatti until the war intervened and he went on to serve in the Special Operations Executive against the Nazis.Alonso, if he does not drive the 24 again, will stand alongside them for good but it is a shame that he is not sticking around for further attempts. Both his wins came when Toyota faced no manufacturer competition and were the class of the field.This is changing, however. For the 2020-21 World Endurance Championship season and Le Mans, the ACO and the FIA, as organisers, announced last weekend that new Hypercar regulations would define the top class. It is designed to cut costs, create a level playing field and encourage participation of both prototypes and entries based on road-going production cars.Toyota have signed up and Aston Martin, on the anniversary of their victory at Le Mans for Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby in the DBR1 in 1959, announced they will join them with the Adrian Newey-designed Valkyrie. McLaren are already in the process of investigating entry, as are numerous privateers. The prospects of it developing into a strong, closely matched field are good and one where a win may be hard fought across a range of designs.The hope is to revitalise the front of the grid but for Tandy the strength of Le Mans has always been in the depth. “It’s our World Cup final,” he said. “At Le Mans you have all the best teams. The best cars, the best drivers from all over the globe together across classes.”A Porsche factory driver who competes full time for the team in the US Weathertech sportscar championship, Tandy also has class wins at the Daytona 24 and the Sebring 12 hours. In his seventh Le Mans this year he finished third in a highly competitive GTE Pro class and his appetite to return is undiminished.After his overall win in 2015, Tandy was disappointed not to defend the title the following year as Porsche cut their entries to two. He drove instead for them in the GT field. Fiercely loyal to the team whose record as the most successful at the race has perhaps defined the marque more than anything, he just wants to keep coming back to Le Mans and battling for another victory, be it outright or in class. “The desire to win, to compete remains the same,” Tandy said before this year’s race.Enthusiasm for this grand institution reflects that of so many other drivers and the reason why Le Mans will remain of importance long after the furore around Alonso’s participation has faded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeda4915793a7e097ff3bec45f12f33e84d05fe3/0_0_3592_2156/master/3592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e9be6cbead09156eca37306efb3633","title":"australia v bangladesh cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"43rd over: Australia 296-1 (Warner 151, Khawaja 82) Mortaza brings himself back and it doesn’t go well. Warner, having to watch on as Khawaja went wild in the previous set, begins the very same way by smashing the first ball over the rope at midwicket for another six! With a single to follow, the opener raises his 150 from 139 balls. What a knock. He has 200 on the shelf here, all of a sudden. Shane Watson has Australia’s highest score (185 not out, also against Bangladesh). I wonder if he knows? Anyway, the good times roll when Khawaja again finds the boundary at backward point. 14 from the over making 59 from the last four. 42nd over: Australia 282-1 (Warner 143, Khawaja 76) As Andrew WK taught us, when it’s time to party, you should party hard. Australia are taking this advice as gospel in this final stanza, Khawaja driving four to backward point, cutting another in the same direction next ball, clipping a full toss off his legs to the midwicket rope before pulling a fourth boundary of the over into the gap at backward square. Who said that Khawaja couldn’t go up the gears? (Me). 19 off the over, if you don’t mind. Along the way, they raised their 150-run partnership. “With Soumya Sarkar adding his name to the pantheon of ‘Wicket-taking Part Time Bowlers’, has this World Cup been particularly kind on the remarkable species?” writes Aditi Prabhudesai of the one man to strike today. “We already have Joe Root, Glen Maxwell (who’s graduated to a full-time bowler in this World Cup) and Finch himself adorning the list. Is it an aberration or was it ever thus?”I wrote 1000 words about this very topic a few years ago in a publication that doesn’t reproduce its content online. The research has paid off during many quiet moments on the radio though, so no complaints. Love me a golden arm.41st over: Australia 263-1 (Warner 143, Khawaja 57) Thanks, Geoff. Shakib has four overs up his sleeve for the death, which is a bit unusual for a spinner in the final ten. I don’t think Mortaza has got his sums quite right in those middle overs. Anyway, sure enough, Warner is happy with it, swapping his stance and getting it over third man for four! Clever. The power is there too, heaving the spinner over the short boundary at midwicket a lonnnng way back. 13 from it. Buckle up. 40th over: Australia 250-1 (Warner 133, Khawaja 54) Nothing streaky about that one! Warner drives straight, and clean, and true. Over Rubel Hossain’s head and back down the ground for six. Nearly hit it to me up here in the commentary box. Then flicks a couple through backward square. “Evening GeoffAdam,” says Phil Withall. “I know you two are pretty close and have done a hell of a lot together but giving up any pretense of security on you computer seems a little bit too trusting. I have a lot of trust in my daughters but wouldn’t let them anywhere near any of my means of communication. The 21 Jump Street style relationship I have long imagined you having seens to have been confirmed.”If I may commit heresy, I refer to the 21 Jump Street reboot, where Jonah Hill says to Channing Tatum, “I f***ing cherish you.” We’re pretty much in joint bank account territory, don’t worry.Speaking of, here’s Adam for half an hour. Email me, it’s fine.39th over: Australia 237-1 (Warner 123, Khawaja 52) Warner thinks that it’s go time against Mustafizur. He backs away and tries to slash over cover, but misses. The ball misses his leg stump by a fraction. So Warner goes again next ball, and this time toe-ends it over cover, another streaky boundary. Mushfiq can’t take the next ball cleanly as Warner misses again, and they get a bye. Khawaja can’t do much with the final three balls.38th over: Australia 230-1 (Warner 119, Khawaja 50) That’s huge for Khawaja. A run-a-ball fifty when he’s struggled so far in the tournament. Plays a gorgeous pull through square from Rubel for four, then raises the milestone with a single next ball. Warner has already carved four through point, then almost gets whacked in the junkyard again trying to pull when the ball is too full. Just gets some bat on it. “Two queries,” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “Warner double ton on the cards? If a wicket falls now, is it time for another game of Maxwellball?”For question one, Warner would have to get a move on. He hasn’t really opened up thus far. For question two, you’d better believe it. I’m sure Aaron Finch will have his best striker padded up.37th over: Australia 218-1 (Warner 113, Khawaja 44) Mustafizur starts after drinks, the most dynamic bowler in this Bangladesh team. He’s zippy, he bends it, he can bowl a good bouncer. Khawaja strides into a couple of perfect cover drives, his signature shot, but one goes straight to cover and one is stopped by the sweeper. No reward for excellence in this format. When Warner gets strike he tries to smear a short ball over midwicket, but only gets a leading edge over cover, and takes two lucky runs.“Loving the dynamic OBO hangovers between you and Adam today, like an intellectual wrestling tag team. Three falls and one submission in operation?”I’m going to assume Brian Withington meant ‘handovers’, though we’ve had a few dynamic hangovers between us in our day. As for falls and submissions, neither sounds comfortable but I’m not up to date with Wrestlemania. Glad you’re enjoying the style though. Needs must when the World Cup drives. 36th over: Australia 212-1 (Warner 110, Khawaja 42) Rubel Hossain is back, pace from the Radcliffe Road end after a change. He’s hanging back of a length, squeezed for one by Khawaja, cut by Warner, pulled by Khawaja. Not damage on the scoreboard, but damage when Rubel smashes Warner right in the Jatz. That was box-to-box midfield stuff, and the crowd goes up in a cheer as Warner drops, but I think they were thinking he’d been bowled. The ball didn’t get through him, it was well and truly stopped. Uncomfortably stopped. I’d rather be bowled. Warner recovers and plays on. That’s drinks.35th over: Australia 208-1 (Warner 108, Khawaja 40) Mashrafe Mortaza comes back on. David Warner doesn’t mind, because there’s a short ball that he can swat away for four. No one out there on the short side of the ground. Warner drives a single, so Mash tries the same ball to Usman Khawaja. Who also pulls it for four. At 80 miles an hour, that’s buffet stuff. This could be a truly huge score today.34th over: Australia 197-1 (Warner 103, Khawaja 34) More fumbles from Bangladesh, Mahmudullah the one giving away an extra run. They’ve been ropey in the field today. Runs from every delivery, seven from Mehidy’s over. He finishes his 10 with 0 for 59.33rd over: Australia 190-1 (Warner 101, Khawaja 29) Warner swaps his bat on 99, then nudges a single through square leg for the milestone run. He trots down the pitch then gives it the traditional leap and punch, but he’s less demonstrative than when he made his ton against Pakistan. Celebration, but not over the top. He settles back down and they take only four singles from Shakib’s over. 32nd over: Australia 186-1 (Warner 99, Khawaja 27) Bonus runs for Warner, as he slams Mehidy straight at backward point but it somehow bursts through. A boundary there, then he slaps three more through cover. Warner on to 99!31st over: Australia 177-1 (Warner 91, Khawaja 26) That is the end of Soumya. Shakib will come back into the attack. It doesn’t work out for him though, as singles and doubles flow. Even though Khawaja misses one reverse sweep, then gets only a sliver of bat on a regulation sweep, that goes past the keeper and fine for four. 30th over: Australia 168-1 (Warner 89, Khawaja 19) Mehidy continues spinning them down, and Khawaja gets marooned through the second half of the over. Drives one hard into his boot, which doesn’t help, and which does hurt. 29th over: Australia 165-1 (Warner 87, Khawaja 18) Thanks Adam. Soumya Sarkar will bowl his fifth over, which he’s only done once before in ODIs. He probably won’t get a sixth though, because Warner clouts him through long-off, then carves him through cover. 1 for 29 from five overs. Warner eyeing off another hundred.Alan Trench writes, “I doubt there’s such a thing as a definitive book on the game (and there’s certainly a lot of dross). There are two excellent books on cricket in the Indian sub-continent, which shouldn’t be overlooked. Ramachandra Guha’s splendid A Corner of a Foreign Field: The Indian history of a British Sport is sadly hard-to-find (and, scandalously, out of print), but well worth trying to get hold of. Peter Oborne (yes, the high-Tory political commentator) wrote a good book on Pakistani cricket, Wounded Tiger, which tells one a lot about Pakistan’s social and political history since Partition too.”The very best history of Pakistan cricket is The Unquiet Ones, by Osman Samiuddin. Wonderful title, wonderful book. Must read. 28th over: Australia 153-1 (Warner 77, Khawaja 16) Up comes Australia’s 150 with Warner push down the ground off Mehidy. This is real middle overs accumulation batting now, neither of the left-handers attacking the ropes. This is a good place for Khawaja to be, ticking the board over without a lot of pressure to get into his innings. Back to Geoff. I’ll catch you for the final ten! 27th over: Australia 149-1 (Warner 75, Khawaja 14) They seem to have got Soumya worked out now, working him around to the sweepers as they continue to build this hefty base. 26th over: Australia 144-1 (Warner 72, Khawaja 12) Nearly a run out! A combination of a fumble and a throw to the wrong end saved Warner, who wasn’t as keen on a single to mid-on as Khawaja was. With the exception of one huge strike from Finch, they are playing Mehidy with a lot of respect. But Warner will back himself to take him down eventually, playing so well against Bangladesh’s spinners over there across two Test tons in 2017. 25th over: Australia 139-1 (Warner 69, Khawaja 10) At last a loose delivery from Soumya, Khawaja able to collect his first boundary of the day with a pull past short fine leg. He’s been given a big chance here to walk in with the foundation very much laid. Given the leftright thing that the Australians have been doing, there was every reason to expect Steve Smith to walk down the steps, not Khawaja. “Yet to put the game on today, it all seems rather comfortable out there based on your OBO, absolute road?” asks Matthew Potter. “First 400 of the tournament coming up?”The only positive for Bangladesh is that it was gripping early for Mortaza and Mustafizur when they rolled down their off-cutters, but there isn’t a blade of grass on there. It’s the type of Trent Bridge track where huge scores are tallied on the reg.24th over: Australia 132-1 (Warner 68, Khawaja 4) They’re happier scoring of Mehidy this time, knocking the ball around the sweepers for seven risk-free runs. Is this Bangladesh’s biggest ever World Cup game, I wonder? Sure, if they don’t beat Pakistan in 1999 they don’t get Test status. And yes, they beat India in 2007. But since then, has there ever been a game for them with so much on the line? 23rd over: Australia 125-1 (Warner 64, Khawaja 1) These are the dictionary definition of gentle medium pacers from Soumya Sarkar but they are very effective. Indeed, he had only one ODI wicket at 138 before today across 48 matches. He’s being turned to because Mortaza doesn’t have Mossadek at his disposal today, the enigmatic all-rounder picking up a niggle against West Indies on Monday. The right-armer dots up Khawaja for the majority of the over, sneaking past his inside edge to have the whole crowd appealing for leg before from the penultimate delivery. Not to be. But lovely part-time work.I should add, if you want to stay in touch with me specifically as we pass the OBO baton back and forth today, please do so on the email or the tweet.22nd over: Australia 123-1 (Warner 63, Khawaja 1) Good cricket from Mehidy Hasan, racing through a tidy over attempting to cramp up the left-handed pair, giving up only two singles down the ground. He isn’t getting a lot of turn but drift is his main weapon at the moment, trying to pass beyond an inside edge or two. 21st over: Australia 121-1 (Warner 62, Khawaja 0) The words I typed and had to quickly delete as the wicket fell were “Australia are well on the way to making a statement here and becoming the first side to 400 in this World Cup.” Realistically, Finch would have needed 150-plus of those, so that equation changes with Khawaja walking out. The number three defends his first ball. I’ve only gone and got Bangladesh a wicket four balls after taking over! Soumya Sarkar has been turned to as a change bowler by Mortaza and he’s created an error from seemingly nowhere. Finch has tried to steer him down to the gap at third man but instead, has given catching practice to the fielder there inside the circle, Rubel doing the rest. The pro-Bangladesh crowd are UP AND ABOUT. 20th over: Australia 117-0 (Warner 59, Finch 52) A gift from Mehidy for Finch, full and outside leg stump, and he can just turn it away to fine leg for four. His pile of runs grows ever larger. Right then. Adam Collins and I will be handballing the blog back and forth a bit today, as per radio broadcasting requirements. He’s on for the next little while, but you can keep emailing me and he’ll get those messages. Back shortly.19th over: Australia 110-0 (Warner 59, Finch 45) Rubel decides he’s being too economical, and throws in a couple of wides to spice things up. A couple of singles, then Mithun gets tangled up trying to field and kicks the ball away from himself to concede a second run. This opening stand is growing to truly frightening proportions for Bangladesh...Aditi Prabhudesai is on the email. “No doubt Mashrafe’s parents had hoped their son would take to superheroing and thus bestowed upon him an alliterative name so essential to the trade. While Mashrafe, M.P. may or may not be vigilanting on the rain-soaked Bangla streets in the dead of night, he sure is an inspiration to those of us edging closer towards the mid-thirties. Creaky knees, pot-bellies I scorn thee.” 18th over: Australia 104-0 (Warner 56, Finch 44) Big appeal from Mehidy against Warner, as the batsman advances to an off-break from around the wicket and misses it. Looks like it would have been going down the leg side. Three singles.Matthew Dony writes in. “If Jessica Morgan lives in Newport, Gwent, then it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t actually always rain. It’s grim, even on a sunny day. But if she lives in Newport, Pembrokeshire, then she’s a fortunate inidual. It’s nice enough there that the weather hardly matters at all. Two places in one country that share a name, but could not be more different.” Simmer down Matthew, you’ll have the Gwent mafia on my back.  17th over: Australia 101-0 (Warner 54, Finch 43) Rubel continues to have the most comfortable day of the bowlers, conceding only three again. A brace through square for Warner, and the century partnership is up. They’ve done this plenty of times, this pair. Time for drinks. 16th over: Australia 98-0 (Warner 51, Finch 43) Mehidy Hasan replaces Shakib to try to find some control. Aaron Finch don’t care. Thwack. Six. Over midwicket with a slog sweep. Finch goes for another, more over long-on this time, and it goes too high and lands just inside the rope, to bounce for four.Finch is the top of the World Cup runs list now, with 386, passing Shakib’s 384. Over to you Shakib, in the second innings. 15th over: Australia 86-0 (Warner 50, Finch 33) Rubel continues, and Warner is happy to calm down a bit after that last flurry. Three singles. The last of them raises Warner’s fifty, and that’s off 55 balls. Much more like it.“Manchester’s rain has moved on to us here in Yorkshire, as is so often the case,” writes John Starbuck. “In Nottingham, the thing to really fear is the intense hailstorm that occasionally manifests itself in June. I’ve been caught in a few and it’s no joke.” Well, Swann says we’re getting our weather from Leicestershire, and that patch of sky doesn’t look too bad.14th over: Australia 83-0 (Warner 48, Finch 32) Here comes David Warner! He takes off his false moustache, removes his spectacles, and reveals his true identity. He advances to Shakib, makes the ball into a full toss and drives it through cover for four. Then stays back, drops to one knee and smears it for six! What a shot, that went miles over midwicket. “Shakib just tried to float that one up, and if you do that on this surface then you get punished,” says Graeme Swann on the radio, and he knows a bit about bowling at Trent Bridge. “I can definitely confirm that the weather was always better in the past, particularly when we were children and summers were long and hot, winters cold and snowy. Definitely. Always.” So true, Simon Ingers.13th over: Australia 72-0 (Warner 37, Finch 32) Ah, here’s Rubel Hossain. Such a big part in Bangladesh cricket, the man who took the late wickets to seal Bangladesh’s progression to the knockouts in the last World Cup, and got rid of England in the process. He has one good moment against Warner this over, beating the outside edge of a flashing shot outside off, and appealing vociferously. But there was no edge. 12th over: Australia 67-0 (Warner 33, Finch 31) Shakib continues, and the Australians milk him well until Warner carves through cover, flat-batted. Sabbir Rahman puts in the long strides to the longest boundary out that way, with the bowler coming from the Radcliffe Road end, and puts in a e to save the four. Excellent effort.“Having driven past an unthinkably sunny Trent Bridge this morning on my way to work – the crowd arriving at the ground from all sides, spilling out of buses on Loughborough, laden with cool bags and floppy hats – and thinking of the things I’ve witnessed inside over the years – Broad standing his ground in 2013 Cook, Bob Willis-like, strangling Ishant Sharma down the leg-side England smearing 445 against Pakistan – I wonder whether there many better places to watch international cricket?” Hard to disagree, Christopher Davis. It’s pretty as a picture, with its open white stands and its turrets and peaks, even when the clouds have come over.11th over: Australia 60-0 (Warner 28, Finch 29) Surely the end of Mashrafe Mortaza’s spell. He bowls a good over, doesn’t give anything away, until the final ball ruins it. Leg stump, leg glance, four runs. Australia ticking along, and Aaron Finch moves to second on the runs list for this World Cup, going past Joe Root’s 367.10th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 26, Finch 24) Spin time. Inside the Powerplay. It will be Shakib al Hasan, with his left-arm tweak. He’s so accurate, and he lands his first couple well. But Finch plays the second better: backing away, then driving crisply along the ground, inside the man at mid-on, and down the ground for four. Wonderful stroke. A couple of singles follow. The fifty partnership arrives as well.9th over: Australia 47-0 (Warner 25, Finch 19) Finch is really winding up now, trying a huge heave that only skews off the inside edge through midwicket for two. Mashrafe is into his fifth over, and uses his tricks, mixing up his pace. Finch goes back into his shell and taps out the rest of the over until he knocks a single past the bowler.8th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 25, Finch 16) Australia’s captain is really winding up now. He smokes Mustafizur but straight to cover. Then hits just as hard to mid-off, who’s right back on the circle, and deep enough to concede a single. So The Fizz bounces Warner, and Warner hooks for six! Not entirely timed, he got a top edge and nearly tripped over himself, but the short square boundaries give full value even for those shots. The ball has been damaged by the impact and the umpires have to choose a replacement. The Fizz bowls a yorker and Warner digs. Then a bouncer and Warner dips.Kristian Petterson writes in. “Can’t let this slide with entreating Wayne Murray to read Derek Birley’s ‘A Social History of English Cricket’. I’ve read a few and, frankly, it’s peerless. Not read the Wilde yet, mind.”Strap your reading glasses on, Wayne.7th over: Australia 36-0 (Warner 18, Finch 15) That’s vintage Warner! It’s still in there somewhere, as he punches Mortaza effortlessly past mid-off for four. That came after an inside edge past the stumps, mind.Jessica Morgan writes in from Newport, Wales, “where it doesn’t always rain,” she says.“Hi Geoff and everyone. Re Wayne’s comment, there’s a rather good book on the geography of cricket, ‘Rain Stops Play’, by Andrew Hignall, with a foreword by John Kettley (he’s a weatherman, and so is Michael Fish... as the song goes). It has some good stuff on rain and the location of cricket grounds. Btw, the cover is a painting of the beautiful ground at Arundel , but sadly it’s reversed. Enjoy the burning orb of gas!”6th over: Australia 31-0 (Warner 13, Finch 15) A couple more uncomfortable balls for Warner, as Mustafizur hits his thigh pad, then bowls a good short ball that requires evasive action. Last ball of the over Finch nearly nicks behind flaying outside off stump. Lots of shots, but not entirely convincing so far today!“Genuinely surprised Australia didn’t put the Lyon on the Line,” writes Nick Toovey. “His mastery of bowling with a new ball in Test cricket would seem suited to mixing it up in the early overs if Cummins and Starc go the distance like they did against Sri Lanka. Is it still the case that there’s a ball at each end? The playing conditions change in ODI’s so often that it’s difficult to keep up.”Indeed. Two new balls, which makes reverse swing in ODI cricket a rare (and eyebrow-raising) occurrence these days. 5th over: Australia 27-0 (Warner 12, Finch 13) Mashrafe starts anew, and Finch drives him over cover for six! Lovely simple shot, just a pick-up drive from a ball that wasn’t all that full. But Mashrafe is bowling from the Pavilion end and that means the short boundary is at cover for the right hander. Finch took full toll. When Warner gets on strike, he cuts hard enough to force a misfield at backward point and score two. Australia’s openers starting to build.In fact that misfield looks like a dropped catch, on the replay. It carried, low, to Sabbir Rahman. Brought into the side today thanks to Mossadek’s injury, and his first contribution is not a good one.4th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 10, Finch 6) Interesting duel here between Warner and Mustafizur. Or between Warner and himself, perhaps. Warner hits straight to the field, then is tangled up by a full straight ball. But as he looks vulnerable, Mustafizur strays onto leg stump and is put away for four through fine leg. Then strays the other way and is smoked, but straight to point.3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 6, Finch 5) Today, Aaron Finch has Shakib al Hasan in his sights. Finch has 347 runs in this World Cup, and Shakib leads the tally with 384. Finch has played two more innings, mind you, including this one. But he’d love to go Top of the Pops today. Knocks away a single from Mortaza. Warner lines up for a pull shot but mistimes the hoick and it bounces to midwicket. Dot ball, then a more circumspect single. A leg bye follows.2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 5, Finch 4) Mustafizur Rahman now, left-arm pace. And that’s more convincing for Warner, an economical punch through the off side that picks him up a boundary. He’s not looking so comfortable when Mustafizur nails him on the pad, but there was some bat involved as the ball cut back in. Then there’s a trash wide ball that Warner slams, but straight to Mehidy at point for a dot ball.1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) Away we go. Mashrafe Mortaza, the captain, starts things off to David Warner. He’s had a funny old tournament, pottering along when he’s made a score. He does the same to start here, defending, defending, inside edging a single eventually. But when Finch comes on strike, the captain flicks four from his first ball with ease.To save typing the numbers again, here’s what Warner has been up to.Morning all! Or other times of day depending where you are. It’s morning at Trent Bridge, any rate. You can direct your emails to me now, rather than Mike. Thanks Mike. Here’s one from Wayne Murray.“OBO’s live updates (and digressions involving school-boy pranks) have been a pleasing occasional distraction from work here in Cape Town. Now that the Proteas have their marching orders, I may need further distraction. The reference to the ‘unidentified burning orb in the sky’ earlier got me thinking: how did it come to pass that a nation so routinely “under the weather” came to invent a sport that specifically requires good weather? Is there a definitive cricketing history that I can read over the weekend?”I’d recommend Simon Wilde’s Biography: The Story of England Cricket. Released recently. A fine work.And just before I hand over to Geoff, some recommended reading if you have time before play starts.  From Geoff himself, on his unwavering love for Glenn Maxwell:And from Russell Cunningham, on, um, his unwavering love for Steve Smith:And with that, over to Trent Bridge for some actual cricket and proper insight...“All this talk of sunshine so early in the day!” writes Ross Hall. “I can’t help but feel we’re now due a day of rain! We’ve had ours in Manchester this morning…Nottingham, brace yourselves!” Oh please, dear god, no. Meanwhile, here’s Emma John and the latest Spin Podcast, this week featuring a lineup consisting of a respected cricket writer and two comedians. I’ll let you decide which ones are which (boom, boom).Team news. Three changes for Australia: Jason Behrendorff, Kane Richardson and Shaun Marsh make way for the returns of Adam Zampa, Nathan Coulter-Nile and Marcus Stoinis. For Bangladesh, Sabbir Rahman and Rubel Hossain come into the team for Mohammad Saifuddin and Mossadek Hossain.Hold the back page: Aaron Finch finally wins a toss! That’s the first time this tournament Australia have done. Unsurprisingly, he reckons getting some runs on the board is a good idea there seems to be plenty of runs in this track. First email of the day. “Morning Mike.” Good evening, Nick Toovey. “With the as-yet-unidentified burning orb of gas appearing over the UK that residents of other countries refer to as ‘The Sun’, and Aus finally (or rumoured to be) playing Nathan Lyon, I wonder if this is the start of the ‘Second Phase’ of the tournament as such – tired pitches, dry weather (hopefully), we could see a complete 180 from yesterday’s nip-and-nibble-like-fire from de Grandhomme in muggy conditions into the long-predicted spinners World Cup in baking conditions.” Burning orb of gas, you say? It’s definitely up there somewhere. Doesn’t get much better than this. So, we’re at the halfway stage of the tournament. How’s it been for you so far? The general consensus is that there is definite room for a bona fide classic match to break out at some point, if the to-date overall disappointing weather will allow it. Pertinent to today’s clash, Shakib al Hasan has proved he can be a world beater, while Australia seem to bring the best out of opposition fielders. Those and more talking points (10, count ‘em, in total), as decreed by Simon Burnton, here:On that incredible knock from Morgan – a 71-ball 148 – his partner-in-runs Joe Root, who himself scored a tidy 88 from 82 balls, didn’t seem too surprised by his captain’s exploits in the win over Afghanistan at Old Trafford. He said:  A lot of the time he will play in that manner, very selflessly, potentially going a little bit too hard, because he wants to set the example. He’s always been capable of doing it. It’s great to see him doing it on this stage, in a World Cup. I’m trying to find the right word to describe his innings. It was just phenomenal really, unbelievable ball striking and it completely took the game away.Australia currently sit in third (see for yourself), having been deposed from top spot first by England – and Eoin Morgan’s brutalist interpretation of the art of batting – and then shunted further down by New Zealand, whose victory over South Africa yesterday was inspired by a measured innings from Kane Williams that was in stark contrast to Morgan’s festival of six-hitting. Ali Martin wrote of the Kiwi’s century:Williamson’s 138-ball masterclass on a pitch that prevented risk-free shot-making was an innings for the ages. The right-hander brought up his 12th ODI century with a six that levelled the scores in the final over, before guiding a four that completed a chase of 242 with three balls and four wickets to spare.Hello and welcome. West Bridgford, not far from the banks of the River Trent, is the location for today’s Cricket World Cup clash, but this blog is initially brought to you from Sydney before heading back to Nottingham on the other side of the world where the dynamic duo of Geoff Lemon and Adam Collins will handle things from their positions on the ground (or in the press box at least) at Trent Bridge. Geoff will be along shortly in the meantime I’ll fill in to get the ball rolling and the juices flowing as Australia seek to reclaim top spot on the World Cup table with victory over Bangladesh. It’s a 10:30am start, local time, 7:30pm AEST. Stick around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca9b862e34c490208175c6e572c50480b4aa066/0_44_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e2bbefd4b220372bbc6e481f6d19f5","title":"royal ascot 2019 gold cup day live horse racing","story":"Maven is a non-runner in the Norfolk Stakes at 2.30pmA great gallery here compiled by Steven Bloor on the pictures desk – ‘Memory Lane: Royal Ascot down the years – in pictures’The on-track bookies haven’t suspended betting on the Queen’s Hat Stakes and greysilver is hot favourite with pink also short. But just look at those prices!Royal Ascot 2019 is the first at which detailed sectional timing – information about how fast the horses are going at every stage of the race – is being supplied after every race, something that has been standard practice at several of the world’s other major tracks for some years.Sectionals offer what can seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering array of numbers, offering insight only to a punter with a first in advanced mathematics.What the numbers reveal on closer inspection, however, is the underlying rhythm of a race. How strong was the pace? Was it even throughout? Was the runner-up given too much to do? Sectionals offer answers to these questions and more, all of which can be of considerable assistance when attempting to back future winners.Despite this, though, there are those who remain unconvinced about the need for such information to be made widely available to punters – including, oddly, some who make a living from … making information available to punters.Bruce Millington, the former editor of the Racing Post no less, suggested as much in a recent column, claiming that “a better ambition would be to present existing data in a way that will appeal to a new generation of punters, but that will rely more on clever use of symbols, colours and user experiences than by smearing even more numbers across a card.”Simon Rowlands, a leading advocate for sectionals, responded for the defence here and punters who like to think for themselves can find a more general guide to the data and its uses here. Race-by-race data can be found via the results section on the At The Races website – look for the “Sectionals PDF” link at the bottom of the result.I don’t think there’s another jockey in Britain or Ireland who gets second-guessed as much as Ryan Moore it comes with the territory, when you’re first jockey at Ballydoyle. He’s had a fruitful week but his critics were still out in force after he was well beaten on Norway, 11-4 favourite for Wednesday’s Queen’s Vase. Looking at the replay again this morning, I think he was the victim of circumstance to a large extent. On the short run to the first bend, a row of three horses went past on his outside, heading for the front of the field, and you can almost see him thinking: ‘Hold on, they’re about to go a bit quick here.’ On a horse whose stamina was not assured, he understandably opted to settle out the back. What happens next but those horses, having reached the front, slam on the brakes and it becomes a steady pace all the way down to Swinley Bottom. The first three at that point remained in the first three all the way to the line. With half a mile to go, Norway was obviously in an impossible position, though it has to be said he still didn’t finish like a horse who could have done a lot better behind a stronger pace. It was a frustrating experience for his backers but I don’t blame Moore for what happened.Fashion is front and centre today and I can recall when the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street. But they did appear at race meetings – at Epsom at the 1991 Derby and at Royal Ascot in 2000. Blue ‘won’ the Queen’s Hat Stakes on Tuesday and Wednesday so will the Queen pull off the greatest shock of all by wearing a blue hat in this now traditional daily betting heat for the third day running?Ladbrokes opened their betting like this: Pink 21, Yellow 31, Green 31, Purple 61, Red 81, Orange 101, CreamWhite 101, Silver 121, Gold 141, Blue 161, Brown 201, Black 501, Union Jack 5001.However, it appears the layers are running scared and they have suspended betting. Ladbrokes have had a big run on pink. Nicola McGeady, the firm’s spokeswoman, said: “We have suspended our betting. The shrewd money was on silvergrey which was the early gamble. Pink was also very popular and due to the volume of bets we feel someone knows somethign we don’t.”A spokesperson for bookmakers.tv said: “Despite bookies having reportedly their best ever day in the Queen’s hat betting history on Wednesday, firms have battened down the hatches for Ladies’ day. Pink, yellow and even silvergrey have all been reported as favourites. As a result, odds compilers are taking no risks on punters fighting back from their worst run of hat betting in recent memory.” Aidan O’Brien 3 winsWilliam Haggas 2Andrew Balding 1Charlie Hills 1Sir Michael Stoute 1Mark Johnston 1Ian Williams 1Charlie Appleby 1David O’Meara 1O’Brien is well on his way to being top trainer here for the 10th time, as Haggas just can’t match him for firepower over the final three days here. John Gosden has yet to score, a situation he hopes to correct in today’s Gold Cup with Straarius. Wesley Ward is 04 so far but Kimari went close for him in the Queen Mary and the American has five more shots at Ascot glory this year.Ryan Moore 3 winsDanny Tudhope 3Frankie Dettori 2Jim Crowley 1Oisin Murphy 1James Doyle 1Richard Kingscote 1Moore was beaten on three consecutive favourites on Wednesday but still bagged the final race to hold onto his position at the top of this table, underlining the quantity of good material he gets to work with. He’s ahead by dint of his three second places, while Tudhope has none of those, but then Tudhope has achieved his three wins from just five rides and that surely is the greater achievement. Of course, Tudhope isn’t even at Ascot today, he’s chasing easier meat at Ripon, which is why he’s an 8-1 shot to come out on top by Saturday evening, odds that do not look generous.You want to know what’s going to win, right? Here are our selections for the third day. Stay here and we’ll have an in-depth preview for every race as the afternoon goes on.2.30 Norfolk StakesSunday Sovereign 9-43.05 Hampton Court StakesCape Of Good Hope 6-13.40 Ribblesdale Stakes Queen Power 100-304.20 Gold CupStraarius 5-45.00 Britannia HandicapEclipse Storm (nap) 40-15.35 King George V HandicapConstantinople 9-2Nothing remarkable about five of those but the elephant in this room is the 40-1 nap. Sometimes “nap” represents great confidence. On this occasion, it stands for my sense that this is a potential winner at a really big price. Is Eclipse Storm the most likely winner in the race? I wouldn’t argue that. But there’s easily enough encouragement in his background to think he could be in the shake-up and it’ll be some thrill if it pans out that way.Saturday’s big race, the Diamond Jubilee Stakes, looks a stormer after the news this morning that Blue Point has been declared to run again, having won the King’s Stand here on Tuesday. He will try to become just the second horse to do the double, following the extraordinary performances by the Australian raider Choisir in 2003.Blue Point evidently loves Ascot, having won four times from five races here, and Charlie Appleby reports him in the form of his life, which explains why they’ve opted to roll the dice with him. Also making a quick reappearance in the race is Le Brivido, who didn’t quite get home when fifth in the Queen Anne on Tuesday. Aidan O’Brien clearly thinks he might have enough speed to make a classy sprinter.After two consecutive days when the forecast rainfall for Ascot was barely on nodding terms with the drenching actuality, it is probably unwise to point out that the prospects for Ladies’ Day, featuring the Gold Cup at 4.20, are much more promising. But you can only deal with the forecasts put in front of you and there is genuine hope of a dry afternoon on the biggest day of the week at the Royal meeting.That would be good news for anyone with an expensive outfit to protect from the elements. Whether it is quite as much of a positive for the punters remains to be seen. Ascot’s ground drains more freely than it did in the past but it still has a reputation for turning a bit gluey as it does so and Straarius, last year’s winner and the favourite for the Gold Cup, is the most obvious example of a horse that might not find it entirely to his liking.The latest going report from the course has just dropped on Twitter and Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, reports that “the going this morning is now soft, good-to-soft in places”.He adds: “It’s actually been dry since racing yesterday, but we did have 10mm of rain during racing yesterday afternoon. The forecast is better for today, it’s due to stay largely dry, with a risk of an occasional sharp shower this afternoon. “There’s a decent breeze blowing up the track at the moment so we may see an improvement in the conditions as the day goes on. The forecast for the rest of the week is largely dry, with a reduced risk of showers for Friday and Saturday.”It was good-to-soft when John Gosden’s magnificent chestnut took the stayers’ race on Champions Day last October, becoming the first Gold Cup winner for half a century to go unbeaten through all season. That, though, was a Group Two and his best form is all on good-to-firm ground. It is certainly something for punters to think about ahead of today’s race and it looks like they already are, with Straarius out to 6-4 from a price of 6-5 overnight.The strength of this year’s opposition may also have something to do with that, as he faces up to last year’s Melbourne Cup winner in Cross Counter and also Mark Johnston’s Dee Ex Bee, who was within two lengths of winning the Derby when he finished second to Masar at Epsom last June. Capri, the 2017 St Leger winner, adds further quality to the line-up, bringing form that includes a three-and-a-quarter length fifth behind Enable in last season’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. Straarius will still start as one of the shorter favourites of the week, and with Frankie Dettori in the saddle after his fine double yesterday, the success, or otherwise, of the Gold Cup favourite is likely to a defining moment in the week-long battle between bookies and punters. The Oaks third Fleeting, in the Ribblesdale Stakes, and Pat Twomey’s exciting Irish two-year-old Sunday Sovereign, a recent purchase by the King Power Racing operation to run in the opening Norfolk Stakes, will be other big fancies today but Straarius is the one that really matters.Chris Cook’s tips for the day are here and the action gets under way at 2.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8504987478123c9aa2a923785b568410d44cca/0_0_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef137d8753b79b88e2e986ab3d000b5","title":"the damned review barbican london ivo van hove","story":"Barbican, LondonThis adaptation of Luchino Visconti’s 1969 film, performed by the Comédie-Française, is full of startling set piecesWhen Luchino Visconti’s movie, The Damned, opened in 1969 it was described as “the Krupp family history as Verdi might have envisaged it.” If Visconti’s film was operatic, Ivo van Hove’s stage version is cinematic: live action is projected on to an upstage screen which also shows documentary footage from 1930s Germany. Played in surtitled French by Comédie Française – making their first visit to Britain in almost 20 years – the result is as thrilling as Van Hove’s National Theatre production of Network.The story traces the rise of the Third Reich through the eyes of a doomed steelmaking dynasty, the von Essenbecks. But Van Hove’s version strikes me as sharper and clearer than Visconti’s in establishing the links between familial decay and Nazi murderousness. While cinematic, it also uses all the properties of theatre. Each death in the dynasty is punctuated by a blast on an industrial whistle and a solemn burial of the body in a line of onstage coffins. A camera even gives us an unnerving corpse-eye-view of entombment. The house lights are then turned up and a camera is trained on the audience as if to suggest the hideous past is capable of re-enactment in the present.The production is filled with startling set pieces. The most chilling shows Martin, heir to the von Essenbeck complex and superbly played by Christophe Montenez, engaging in dangerous games with a young girl. The magnetic Elsa Lepoivre as Martin’s mother stalks the family home like Lady Macbeth and deploys her sexuality as a weapon both with her lover, played with insatiate power-hunger by Guillaume Gallienne, and the family’s Nazi cousin, invested by Éric Génovèse with a cold-eyed calculation. In a famous echo of history we also see Denis Podalydès as Konstantin, the supplanted inheritor of the factories, joining the Brownshirts in a beer-swilling bacchanal only to be mown down by Hitler’s SS.One particular moment, in which the camera tracks Martin’s mother through the labyrinthine Barbican, provokes laughter. Otherwise, this is a riveting spectacle acted by a great ensemble that – aided by Jan Versweyveld’s design, Tal Yarden’s video and Eric Sleichim’s sound – shows a family inexorably destroyed by its complicity with a world-shaking tyranny.• At the Barbican, London, until 25 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a367e6a64395b1dd39af9a5a84e822f2f10f753/306_670_3666_2199/master/3666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f79a92e200a325568a38ff548c85ed63","title":"wheres the cheapest place to store 500gb of data online","story":"Reeling from a Dropbox price hike, Kate wants somewhere cheaper to store her 500GB of photos and filesI’ve just received notification that my Dropbox account is going up in price to more than £90 a year. I like Dropbox’s interface and ease of use from the mobile app, but £90 seems steep for what I require. What cheaper options do I have for securely storing about 500GB of photos and files? KateMost of us just evolve the way we do things by making convenient short-term decisions. A price jolt should prompt you to rethink how you are storing your data, where you are storing it, and why. Different people have different devices and different needs, so I can’t pick the best strategy for you or anybody else. However, I can give you a few things the think about.The first and best reason is that you often need access to the same data from multiple devices, some of which you use while away from home. The second – very sensible – reason might be that you want an off-site backup where your data will be safe if you’re burgled, your house burns down, or there is some other catastrophe.A third reason might be that you are sharing your photos and (less likely) data with friends and family, or possibly with the public. Millions of people shared their photos on Flickr, and billions share reduced-quality versions on social networking services such as Facebook and Instagram.A fourth reason might be that you have no way to keep a local backup. If so, you are in trouble. Online storage services are like lobster pots: it’s easy to get into them but hard to get out.In a better world, you would be able to move 500GB of data from one service to any other in a few seconds, without downloading it and re-uploading it. Sadly, that’s not the case today. And if your data only exists in one online storage pot, then you have no backup and your data is at risk. People lose data every day because they forget and can’t recover passwords, their accounts are hacked, or their service provider has a hardware malfunction or makes a mistake.You should have local copies and backups of everything, so that you can walk away and just let Dropbox close your account. If you are not in that position, keep paying Dropbox until you are.Dropbox has increased its starting price to £95.88 a year, which is £7.99 a month if paid annually. However, it also doubled the storage allowance to 2TB, which used to cost about $200 (£158) a year, and it has added some extra features. It’s still competitive with other leading services that usually don’t store 30 days of revisions or let you easily undo a file deletion.Google One, as it’s now called, charges £7.99 a month for 2TB, which drops to an annual fee of £79.99 a year. At that price, I’d stay with Dropbox. It’s better.At the moment, your best bet appears to be Switzerland-based pCloud, which offers 500GB for £3.59 a month or £42.99 a year, and 2TB for £7.99 a month or £84.99 a year. Better still, pCloud is currently offering a lifetime 500GB for a single payment of £160 (usually £430) or 2TB for £320 (usually £850). I’ve not used the service, but you could try its free 10GB offering and see if it suits you.Think about splitting your photo storage and your data storage. If you are like me, you have large image files – each jpeg from my Nikon D7500 takes up about 12MB – and relatively small text files. My Work folder holds more than 10,000 files but still consumes less than 3GB. I could zip it, password protect it and store it in any of the free online drives, except Dropbox.Flickr used to be a great place to store 1TB of images for free, but late last year, Verizon sold it to Smugmug. Smugmug charges $5.99 a month or $48 a year for unlimited photo storage. That’s not a bad deal for a service that works really well with photographs.Both Amazon and Google also offer unlimited photo storage, with slight catches.Amazon Photos is free with an Amazon Prime account, and part of its appeal is that it will accept and display RAW files, not just jpegs. And while it can analyse and tag your photos for search purposes, that’s optional.Google Photos, born out of the wreck that was Google Plus, offers unlimited storage as long as your photos are less than 16MP. This makes it useless for most serious photographers, at least as a backup service. Google also uses machine learning to analyse your photos so that you can search for people, places and things. Search is a useful feature, but photos give away vast amounts of personal information.If you use an Android phone, your snaps are stored in Google Photos, and you can choose to clear local copies from your phone to save space and pull them down from the cloud on demand – internet connection required. Amazon Photos can do something similar.Test any photo storage site before you commit to using it. Upload a couple of photos and then download them to make sure they still have the same dimensions in pixels, that the files are the same size, and that they have the same names. This rules out Facebook, Instagram, Imgur and many other services.Online storage sites are really handy for storing smartphone pictures until you can download and archive them, and for sharing photos with other people. However, SD cards are getting so much bigger and cheaper that they’re an increasingly attractive alternative.All my photos are on three hard drives (each PC is backed up to a 2TB or 3TB drive, and the backups are backed up to an 8TB drive), but SD cards make it easy to create an off-site backup.Also, if you have a laptop with a card slot, you can hide as much data as you’re likely to need while travelling somewhere about your person. Micro-SD cards are tiny. The obvious drawback is that, unless you encrypt the data, they are not secure if you lose them.Have you got a question?

LGBT critics such as RuPaul have suggested the show fails to capture the concept of “camp” and I generally agree. Nonetheless, it’s a great opportunity to see the fun, extravagant side of the Costume Institute’s amazing collection. Also, the show includes a great display of art and objects from LGBT history, including Pennington’s portrait – the only full portrait – of Oscar Wilde, and Paul Cadmus’s often-discussed but rarely seen The Fleet’s In!, with its scandal-rousing scene of mixed gay and straight cruising in 1930s New York.The show Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989 is spread over two spaces: work from the 1970s is at the world’s only museum of LGBT art, the Leslie-Lohman Museum (suggested admission $10, until 21 July), while art from the 1980s is at NYU’s Grey Art Gallery (suggested admission $5, until 20 July). The show clearly sets artworks in the context of the fight for LGBTQ rights and changing concepts of sexuality and gender. Highlights include David Hockney’s unusual portrait of Divine, a Bachardy charcoal sketch of the dying Christopher Isherwood, a great collection of Boston school photographs, and pictures by and of Keith Haring (I especially like an Annie Leibovitz shot of Haring nude and body-painted by himself).The New York Public Library’s Love and Resistance: Stonewall 50 (until 13 July) exhibition features archival material from the period around the Stonewall uprising. Photographs by lesbian activists Kay Lahusen and Diana Davies are the unifying theme but there are also other photos such as Fred W McDarrah’s iconic shot of Stonewall’s strikingly erse patrons. The ephemera are particularly touching, such as a Gay Liberation Front newsletter from 1970, asking readers to send suggestions about commemorating the Stonewall uprising to Craig Rodwell, one of the organisers of the first Gay Pride march.The Lesbian Herstory Archives (484 14th Street), in Brooklyn’s original “lesbian” neighbourhood of Park Slope has thousands of archival items, memorabilia and artefacts from the city’s lesbian history and culture that will help visitors gain insight into the evolution of the community. It is free to visit but check the opening times, which change month to month. Group tours are available but should be booked in advance.Restaurants Via Carota, Buvette, and the newly opened Bar Pisellino (all in Grove Street, West Village) are owned by the astoundingly successful couple Jody Williams and Rita Sodi, who have bought their passion for – and knowledge of – authentic French and Italian cooking to the West Village with these three classy establishments. Via Carota’s green salad was described as the best in the world by chef and writer Samin Nosrat in the New York Times, while the “near genius” Manhattan served at Buvette is the best in the city, according to grubstreet.The Bureau of General Services – Queer Division (208 West 13th Street, until 15 September), at the LGBTQ Center, is my favourite queer bookstore in NYC with a great selection of ’zines and artist books. Make sure you check out the Bureau’s Y’all Better Quiet Down, a group exhibition of art and ephemera in response to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising curated by Nelson Santos.At the Brooklyn Museum, the Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall exhibition (until 8 December) explores the profound legacy of the Stonewall uprisings within contemporary art and visual culture today. The show masterfully embodies queerness at its most fluid and expansive, bringing together the voices of 28 artists born after 1969 whose artworks look at the past in search for mirrors to their own queer identities, while projecting a more nuanced and intersectional future. In the heart of the West Village is Julius’ (159 West 10th Street), the city’s oldest standing gay bar, where the famous Sip-In took place. The 1966 action by the Mattachine Society challenged bars and restaurants that refused to serve alcohol to homosexuals, a common practice at the time. Go for the happy hour (every day from 4pm-9pm) and stay for the comfort food.Take a voguing class (single class $17, held twice weekly from 6pm), at the Gibney Dance studios on Broadway with Jason Anthony Rodriguez, aka Slim Ninja. Vogue is a form of self-expression in which striking elegant poses elevates your confidence and, most importantly, yourself. After body-conditioning and stretching you will find exercises and combinations that weave together key voguing elements such as arms control, runway, cat walk, duck walk, and dips.Alice Austen House on Staten Island was the home of the prolific and pioneering photographer where, rebelling against Victorian mores, she lived with her partner, Gertrude Tate. The museum houses a permanent collection of Austen’s work, with documentary photos capturing city life in the late 1800s and early 1900s, sitting with early images of women dressed in male drag. There are also exhibitions of other photographers’ work – the current exhibition, Stonewall at 50 (until 30 September), includes portraits of 15 intergenerational LGBTQ+ activists and artists by Collier Schorr. (Museum entrance is a $5 suggested donation).Another special exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, Pride: Photographs of Stonewall and Beyond, is on at the Museum of the City of New York (until 31 December, $18). It is made up of a wealth of images by Fred W McDarrah, former staff photographer for the Village Voice, who worked at the liberal US news and culture paper for more than five decades. The show includes photographs of the initial Stonewall uprising, intimate portraits of significant people in the LGBTQ rights movement, and images of pride marches, protests and other public LGBTQ events.Dance bands from around the world bring a glorious open-air party to Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park for the annual Midsummer Night’s Swing, with events every night until 13 July. It’s one of the city’s largest outdoor dance events, and has been running since 1988, and includes different live acts each night playing swing, salsa, R\u0026ampB, disco and tango, alongside DJs, dance instructors and a late-night silent disco.Bayard Rustin’s Residence was the home of the key strategist in the civil and gay rights movements. He was a proponent of nonviolent protest, a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr, and a lead organiser of the landmark 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He lived at the Chelsea apartment from 1962 to 1987, and a plaque outside now honours his life and work, including the famous quote: “We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers.” For more on this, there is a Making Gay History episode from 2016 featuring an interview with his partner Walter Naegle, and a 1986 recording of an interview between Bayard and Peg Byron, who was writing for the DC-based gay newspaper the Washington Blade.Mood Ring is a gay bar in Bushwick on Myrtle Avenue, a few steps away from tropical-themed party venue Bossa Nova Civics Club. I’ve hosted my queer Caribbean party “No Badmind” at Mood Ring and the uplifting energy and inclusiveness is what keeps me coming back. The drinks list features astrology-themed cocktails ($11) and this is definitely my go-to spot for a good late night.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

In the last three weeks alone, two of the most notorious examples have made their way to screen. Admittedly one – Amazon’s Good Omens – functions as a pretty watertight argument for never trying to adapt an unfilmable book. But the other is Catch-22, and that functions as an equally watertight argument to the contrary.I have to admit that I didn’t see this coming. Throughout its gestation, the Catch-22 series seemed like an almighty act of hubris as if Hulu, still drunk on the success of The Handmaid’s Tale, went out of its way to adapt an even more knotty work. Catch-22’s unfilmable reputation came about in part because someone did try to film it once, in the form of Mike Nicholls’ 1970 feature, and the results were patchy at best. A similar fate of smug, too wacky mediocrity seemed inevitable.And yet somehow they have pulled it off. The Catch-22 series is successful in almost every way. It is beautifully shot, thoughtfully written and incredibly well acted. It takes plenty of liberties with Joseph Heller’s book – there are approximately 25 fewer characters, almost no flashbacks and the ending is entirely different – but, having seen the series, I have come to the conclusion that these changes are exactly what make it sing.I’ll try to stay clear of spoiler territory, but the biggest decision made by the film-makers was to break the book apart and put it back together in the right order. The book hops about all over the place, leaping from viewpoint to viewpoint and back and forth through time. It’s a terrific sleight-of-hand – when Heller decides to fill in the blanks caused by this literary restlessness, it comes as a punch in the guts – but it would have made for an incredibly annoying TV show.Instead, the series takes its time to wear down its protagonist, bombardier John Yossarian (Christopher Abbott). His downfall is parcelled out carefully along the way, and each new attempt to escape his fate brings about new and awful consequences. By the time he is finally broken, it has a feeling of inevitability that wasn’t present in the novel. It also reinforces the notion that Yossarian is a classic antihero, rather than a sane innocent trapped in a world of madness. Every time he tries to wriggle free of his commitments, he causes something terrible to happen to someone else. When this happened in the book, everything was rationalised through prose. Without that safety net, Yossarian quite often just comes off as a dick. Perversely, this makes him a little easier to understand.Speaking of prose, another smart decision was to avoid Heller’s tone as often as possible. The book is a smashed Rubik’s cube, full of repetition, circular reasoning and busted logic. All the characters are trapped by their own thought patterns, which is fun to read but – as anyone who has watched every episode of the tonally similar W1A can attest – can be brutal to sit through. It still happens here and there, so the doctor’s explanation of insanity is thankfully still intact, but it isn’t quite as punishing. Stripping the plot back and rebuilding it in the shape of a classic drama feels like a something of a masterstroke.Especially compared with Good Omens, which suffered enormously from how faithful it was to the book. I don’t know anyone, aside from those falling within the very highest percentile of Terry Pratchett fandom, who didn’t groan in despair when Amazon’s adaptation opened with several minutes of arch narration over what seemed to be a deliberate copy of QI’s opening titles. Catch-22, less in thrall to its fans, is much more confident in its ability to take on a new shape, and this makes it far easier to watch.It also feels more open-ended, as if Hulu has already entertained the idea of lengthening the series out beyond the source material. Let’s hope that the failure of the last two Handmaid’s Tale seasons is enough to put them off. However, if this was always intended to be a finite six-episode retelling, then Catch-22 might just go down as the first time that anyone has successfully filmed an unfilmable novel.Catch-22 airs Thursdays, 9pm on Channel 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3456b9d369a3802f35ccfb8ef120dfb48b24c46/1217_1039_3286_1972/master/3286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da84e941fa211cee3227a6fb5bcd0073","title":"i wake up around 430am top chef adria wus recipe for a productive week","story":"In a series on the efficiency secrets of highly productive people, restaurant chain owner and Sunday Brunch regular Adria Wu explains why she loves to start her day early and how some clever productivity innovations bring order to her busy scheduleThanks to her previous life in finance and engineering, Adria Wu professes to being more “annoyingly detailed” than others in her industry. During the past four years, the founder of Maple \u0026amp Co has used this virtue to open four healthy eating restaurants in London and plan the launch of another two for the end of the year.In between running her business, the Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef is a regular on TV cooking show Sunday Brunch, writes for health magazines, and mentors aspiring entrepreneurs. She manages her packed schedule by embracing the best of both new and old tech to maximise her efficiency. And her early morning starts, a focus on team management and her embrace of nifty productivity systems means there are still enough hours in the day for her to enjoy life beyond work – and even spend a bit of time in the kitchen with her first love: food.I normally wake up earlier on Monday mornings – around 4.30am. The rest of the week it’s usually around 5.30am. If I don’t set my week on Monday morning the rest of the week starts falling behind. I can’t work at night so early in the morning I find time to get organised for the day, get my thoughts sorted and understand my own priorities.I have a written to-do list. I know a lot of people on my team use the Sticky Notes function on their laptops so they always have it on their devices. I like having my quiet time in the mornings, if I’m having a cup of tea I don’t really want to get overwhelmed by my phone or laptop. I have my notebook instead and I can think without any distraction about what I need to get done for the day.I usually eat breakfast with my daughter after she wakes up. My mornings are spent with her until her nanny arrives at 10am. I try to squeeze in a quick one-hour workout either with my trainer, or on my Peloton bike – which lives in my room and is a constant reminder for me to work out.I calendarise everything. If I need an hour to check emails, I put it in the calendar, if I need half an hour for a call, I put that in my calendar. If my nanny is off for four hours or my husband needs to travel, that goes in as well. My staff also do it so I don’t bother them when their time is blocked off. I mix all my social plans and work into one big calendar, it’s a tool I find really, really important.Most days I have meetings here and there, but one day a week is dedicated to team meetings. I have about 30 people on my team and we all have one-to-one meetings with our direct reports. Throughout the week we use collaborative online docs to jot down any issues that come up that we want to discuss, for example, if I want to make changes to pricing. It means the team isn’t calling each other every time something happens at a store.It also means less time organising, updating and checking actionable points and more time to think strategically about the business. And it’s much more reliable to have things recorded on a page, as there’s a much lower risk of miscommunication.As a business we probably spend a disproportionate amount of time on good HR practices. It’s so important to have the right team supporting me. To make sure everyone is at their most productive, we ensure everyone’s job description is shared. So anyone from the kitchen porter to the head of operations has my job description and vice versa.I love leaving voice messages for the team on WhatsApp. I started doing this because some investors I work with are based abroad and calling long distance over the time zone differences is not so easy. Now, we all do it. For example, if my head chef goes to see some new central kitchens, he records photos, videos and two-minute voicemails that he sends over instead of writing everything down in an email. This simple technology really makes it much more efficient to communicate and share ideas.I take part in a mentorship program called Mentor Matcher. I take on up to two interns at a time and they come in at least three times a week. I come from a spreadsheet and PowerPoint background so they’re always showing me new and interesting tools. One of them introduced me to Canva for design – it is like Photoshop but online-based and much simpler to use. This reduces the time spent sharing files back and forth.I miss cooking a lot. I have a wonderful head chef who takes care of the day-to-day menus in stores. I don’t get to do as much physical cooking, but I do get to do some recipe testing. Right now, I’m working on a porridge recipe with a magazine and researching vegetable-based recipes for a show I’m presenting.I love having a glass of wine to wind down in the evening. Even though we do nutritious food at Maple and I teach and talk about all things healthy and amazing for your body, I find having a glass of wine really relaxing.I find my brain stops working around 8.30pm. I try to get home around 7pm and see my daughter before she goes to bed. I love to cook dinner at home and watch cooking shows or sitcoms on Netflix. The last thing I do is have a hot shower. I find it super relaxing and it’s one of my favourite things to do at night.SAP Concur provides intelligent solutions to help your business automate admin tasks such as expenses and invoices – giving you and your business the time and energy to focus on growing, innovating and making fruitful connections.

Leading campaigners on how to look after yourself before heading back into the frayEvery week it seems there is something new to protest about. If we are now in the Anthropocene age – where human effects on the globe take precedence over nature – we are also in the age of activism, one of protesting against our damaging impact on the world. This dissent has moved beyond the fringes of political engagement to packing our streets with people and placards bearing slogans that range from seeking to stave off climate change to stopping Donald Trump and staying in the EU. Protests are increasingly taking in wider age ranges and demographics, too, but for those grassroots organisers for whom this is a long-term mission, the toll of such responsibility can be a heavy one.Activism comes with all the stresses of any job – long hours, “office” politics and overflowing inboxes. Couple this with the fact that activism is in a sense defined by its marginality and the job sits firmly between a rock and a hard place. How, then, do activists stay motivated when the odds are against them?Bill McKibben, environmentalist and author“Try to spend a little time outdoors, whether it is in a city park or out in the woods or mountains. One of the things we are fighting for is a world where nature still has some place and so it’s good to get out and remind ourselves of that. I try to get outside every day, just for a few minutes. If I can just see the sky, that’s good sometimes I only want to see the stars for a few minutes and that makes me feel worthwhile.”Eve Ensler, playwright and feminist activist“It is important to realise that the struggle is long, so you have to take care of your body. You have to have pleasure, joy and humour in your life, otherwise you just become bitter and full of sadness. Nature is critical, dance is critical, sex is critical.“Pleasure is what fuels us. Sometimes when we are doing this work, it can feel like we are not allowed to feel anything but pain, yet having done this work for a long time, if you want to keep going you need to have joy, as that’s what will keep you motivated to go back.”Bisi Alimi, LGBT activist“I can get a lot of online abuse for the work that I do, as well as often seeing a lot of trauma from fellow LGBT people who reach out to me. That used to give me very intense anxiety. I have started going to the gym regularly for my mental health and sometimes, when I am really angry, I will go to a boxing class, which helps me get it out of my system. This allows me to see whatever has upset me less personally. I go to the gym five times a week and I also run at least twice a week, so every day I am doing something active that allows me to disconnect.”Harry Gay, founder of Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants“Anger is an important motivator and it is important we don’t shy away from it as a driver for change. It is natural to be angry about the state of the world and at the things we see that are unjust. We’re often told that anger is a negative emotion and that we should shy away from it perhaps interpersonally that is true, but on a structural level it is important to not get sad about what is happening around you but to get angry and then to channel it in the right way, through action. That is what keeps us going and fighting for migrant rights and for all those who are discriminated against we cannot get despondent.”Patrisse Cullors, founder of Black Lives Matter“I’m a big proponent of therapy and always tell activists and organisers that they should be seeing a therapist to get them through. We are on the frontlines hearing so many painful stories from so many people that we become therapists ourselves, but we are not trained, so it creates an unfortunate environment for burnout.“I have been doing activism since I was 16 years old, but I soon found out that it was triggering difficult memories from my childhood and was having an impact on how I saw myself – I couldn’t separate myself from the people I was organising. I have been doing this for 20 years now and the only reason I have been able to do it for so long is because I have been relying on other people’s skill sets to help me take care of myself and be a better person.“People forget that activists are human beings and that there is a lot at stake for us. Often we do this work because it’s what we have experienced ourselves.”Gina Miller, anti-Brexit campaigner and lobbyist“What can stop me in my tracks are those who attack my family and do it premeditatively, those who rant to my children, put it in an envelope and send it to my address. To get a letter which says, ‘We know where your children are, we’ll be taking them today,’ is truly shocking.“When that happens, I have to cry and let it out because you can’t hold it all in. There is a temptation that as activists we have to be strong all the time, but in private you have to look after yourself and let your emotions come out when they arise. I will cry it out, I will hug my family and then refocus on what I am doing and get ready to keep going again. I will take the negative energy and redirect it into something positive.”Miqdaad Versi, anti-Islamophobia campaigner“My parents sacrificed so much as immigrants coming to this country and working all hours to send me to a private school, which they thought would give me the best chance in life. While I might not agree with private schools as an institution, I understand how important it was for my parents that I succeed in life, so I have a responsibility to them to not only do well but to stand up for others like them and to make society a better place for everyone.“I have been lucky that my parents worked so hard for me and that means I can and should take the time to continue my activism. Knowing what they went through pales in comparison to my struggles and that keeps me going.”Owen Jones,  columnist and activist“It is important to feel that you are part of a broader movement for justice and that you are not just some isolated inidual in fear. I spend a lot of time with LGBT activists, socialists, feminists and anti-racism activists, and this reminds me that I am part of a collective struggle. The attacks I receive aren’t personal and I am not the only person who gets them – these people just hate the things we are fighting for and believe in. It should never become background noise but, equally, I wouldn’t want to be intimidated by it because that would be giving them a victory they don’t deserve. We have to maintain our solidarity in the face of the far right.”Lucy Gavaghan, 17, environmental campaigner“You have to realise that, as one person, you can’t change everything and do it all. If you start feeling guilty that you are not doing all the right things it can really set you back and mean that you are not making progress. You need to give yourself time to step back from your cause and what you are fighting for because then, when you go back to it, you are ready and not exhausted.“In a way, school work can be a good way to step back and it doesn’t become too pressurised if I stay on top of it. Through the campaigning I can keep a wider perspective on changing the world and through school I can also focus on my own future.”Sam Knights, Extinction Rebellion“Finding people to talk to and support you is incredibly important. I cannot describe the huge emotional weight that was lifted for me when I first felt comfortable talking about the climate crisis and how that was affecting my mental health. It’s easy to feel like we are alone but there are thousands of people who feel like this and they want to talk to you, too. So please, as a first step, start talking to people about it.”Ryan Hart, domestic abuse campaigner“My brother Luke and I campaign against domestic abuse because our mother and sister Charlotte were killed by our father. That means that we spend all day speaking about our trauma. It gets very emotional. However, the dogs that we share have really helped us. They have shown us how to live in the moment and they are always happy as long as we are there. Luke and I were at university for most of the dogs’ early years and Mum and Charlotte were the ones who raised them. The dogs have mannerisms which remind me of them and it keeps their memory alive.”Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, cook and environmental campaigner“I have a cold shower every morning to wake me up and get me going. I have a blast of cold water for a minute or two and that is a real shock to the system when you first start, but it helps you go through the day with a spring in your step. It’s almost like the worst thing that could happen to you all day has already happened. It’s never a pleasant feeling when that cold water comes down, but you always feel so much better for having done it. No matter how hard things have been in the days before, that cold water is a ‘reset’ it means each day starts anew.”Ash Sarkar, journalist and activist“I quite enjoy that feeling of sparring with someone online. It is a reclamation of your agency. Twitter is also a little crucible for comedy it trains the bit of your brain that puts together things that are incongruous or funny.“It is important to remember that a lot of activists aren’t at the sharp end of this politics. We are leading relatively comfortable and protected lives and the people who are on the frontlines live in fear and can’t speak up for themselves. The thing that makes me feel a great sense of purpose and political will is that these people have never stopped fighting or organising because they don’t have the luxury of giving up – it is a fight for survival. If they can do it, so can I – even on Twitter.”Aderonke Apata, LGBT activist, founder of African Rainbow Family“Each time we think we have tackled an issue, another one rears its ugly head. There is no way that I or any other activist in the world can solve all of its problems, but we have to keep sight of the small victories those are the ones that keep us going.“If any of the people we work with get granted asylum, it is a huge victory for me and shows us that we are doing good. Although there is a lot that we still need to change, it gives me satisfaction that we are moving in the right direction. We need to remember to celebrate that small step towards disrupting the whole system.”Farhana Yamin, human rights lawyer and environmentalist“I didn’t watch the Channel 4 report on me getting arrested for gluing my hands outside the Shell building for weeks, until my daughter said it had got more than 1m views. I started reading the comments online and the majority were positive, but there were lots that were very offensive and rude. However, it did make me realise that for every nasty comment, there are many more constructive ones, supporting the cause and pushing me to do better. Even though there is never enough time to read and respond to everything, I want to make the conscious choice to engage as much as possible as that is the only way to keep going. We need to encourage discussion within the movement – and with the public who might be against us.”Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement“Our work as activists can be incredibly challenging and personal you have enormous responsibilities to speak up for those who have been victimised and abused. Yet, of course you can’t speak for everyone and all causes, and that can make you feel incredibly guilty. It is important, then, to remember that the arc of progress is long and that we have to pick our battles, to stand up for what we believe in and who we speak for. If you try to do everything at once, you just won’t be able to succeed.”Robin Morgan, poet and radical feminist“I look around me to stay motivated. People need to do something active and positive, however small. Write a letter, send an email. Picket, march, protest, sign a petition, sit in. Join a group and multiply your effect. Run for office. Say what you actually think. You can’t wring your hands and roll up your sleeves at the same time, so do something – and right away you will feel better. So will the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de553a1cf46efb3f03d4dd0a7bb693d0dd4b7149/0_227_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1de98426c9847524ebcbb26b9502e0e8","title":"former interpol chief meng hongwei put on trial for bribery in china","story":"Meng vanished in September during a visit to China from his home in LyonThe former Interpol president Meng Hongwei confessed to accepting more than $2 million in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, a Chinese court said on Thursday.The No. 1 Intermediate Court in the northeastern port city of Tianjin said Meng read a statement containing the confession at a hearing. Elected president of the international police organisation in 2016, Meng disappeared into custody after traveling to China from France at the end of September. Interpol was not informed of Meng‘s detention and was forced to ask China about his whereabouts.In a statement in early October, the Chinese authorities admitted they were holding Meng and China’s ministry of public security said that he was being investigated for accepting bribes.A confession assures a conviction but it was not immediately clear when a verdict and sentence would be handed down. Confessions, which are often televised, have become a hallmark of President Xi Jinping’s rule.Admitting guilt and expressing regret can result in slightly lighter punishment, though China has been quick to hand out life sentences for corruption under a campaign run directly by the president, Xi Jinping.Meng’s wife, Grace, has remained in France, where Meng was stationed for Lyon-based Interpol, and has accused Chinese authorities of creating a “fake case” against him for political reasons.There are suspicions Meng had fallen out of favour with Xi, who has come down hard on corruption and perceived disloyalty in what observers say is calculated to strengthen party control while bringing down potential challengers to his authority.The Tianjin court said Meng had abused his positions, including as a vice minister of public security and maritime police chief, to take bribes. Shown on television wearing a plain brown windbreaker and flanked by two bailiffs, Meng appeared older and grayer than during his time as one of the nation’s top law enforcement officers. He has already been fired from his positions and kicked out of the Communist Party. While serving at Interpol, Meng retained his title as a vice minister of public security."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78c6682352eab1f9d7f349c5564e177a9ee0b58/0_0_6089_3655/master/6089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a51e2baec326ca0b22fb08e48faa8ee","title":"venice mayor luigi brugnaro urges unesco to place city on world heritage blacklist","story":"Luigi Brugnaro says he has no faith in Italy’s government to resolve cruise ship problemThe mayor of Venice has urged Unesco to place the city on its world heritage site blacklist as he lambasted Italy’s transport minister for failing to endorse a plan to ert cruise ships from the busy Giudecca canal.Luigi Brugnaro’s frustration has been brewing since a huge vessel crashed into a tourist boat on the canal in early June, injuring four people.“We will write to Unesco to ask for the city to be put on the blacklist,” he told Radio 24. “Venice is in danger and we feel in danger.”Brugnaro said the city had no faith in the government, and felt particularly led down by the transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, who has rejected a plan agreed by Italy’s previous administration that would have closed off the canal to cruise ships.After the crash, which provoked more protests against cruise ships in the lagoon, Toninelli said a solution would be announced soon. Toninelli, a member of the Five Star Movement, which often fights against major infrastructure projects, visited the city last week – by helicopter.A source at the local authority said he did not meet the city’s leaders to discuss the original plan or his alternative proposals, which include building a new cruise ship terminal at either the Lido San Nicolò or in Chioggia, a coastal town south of Venice. Toninelli has suggested putting the options to a referendum on his party’s online platform, Rousseau, which it often uses to craft policy.Unesco originally gave authorities until 2017 to undertake measures to protect Venice’s monuments and preserve its fragile environment, or risk the city being put on its endangered world heritage list. That deadline was extended by a year, and again until 2021 as leaders showed encouraging signs of making improvements in terms of managing the tourism flow.Their most crucial task, however, was to come up with a plan to ert cruise ships. The project agreed in 2017 foresaw those weighing more than 96,000 tonnes entering the lagoon via the Malamocco canal to reach the mainland area of Marghera, where a passenger terminal would be built. Medium-sized vessels would go past Marghera and take the longer route through the Vittorio Emanuele canal before reaching the Marittima terminal, where cruise liners currently dock."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"State\u0026rsquos alcohol prices are second priciest in bloc behind FinlandReport on EU-UK \u0026lsquomapping exercise\u0026rsquo notes 147 cross-Border projects linked to Belfast Agreement\u0027EU willing to rewrite political declaration dealing with future trade relationship with UK\u0027Minister warned \u0026lsquoit\u0026rsquos a mistake you\u0026rsquoll regret\u0026rsquo to run roughshod over Fianna F\u0026aacuteilRescued pup becomes internet sensation after helping garda\u0026iacute locate injured manHighs of 24 degrees next week will be accompanied by torrential downpoursThree teenagers died after being caught in a crush at the Greenvale Hotel in MarchColleges claimed new measures would hinder efforts to deal with sexual assault casesFormer OPW staffer alleges major value-for-money failures in State bodyDisorderly Brexit or other negative external shock could prevent overheatingVaradkar to be in discussions on EU\u0026rsquos strategic agenda for the next five yearsThe many aims for inidual sectors remain highly aspirational with little detailSiptu warns of further possible strikes by healthcare assistants, lab aides and portersVaradkar tells D\u0026aacuteil \u0026lsquoI have the measure of Trump\u0026rsquo after their meeting in ShannonMinister for Finance says it is too early to say if IFAC\u0026rsquos recent concerns are legitimateSome 22 schools built by Western Building Systems were found to have structural flaws"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3931987.1561026957!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dog praised after helping emergency services find his owner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Jack would not move for anybody until he saw Pat was in the ambulance.” Photograph: An Garda SíochánaA rescue dog has become an internet sensation after alerting gardaí to where his owner had fallen into a ditch. Pat Brennan alerted gardaí on his mobile phone that he had fallen into a ditch and couldn’t get out of it while he was out taking Jack for his nightly walk in Portarlington, Co Laois. The ditch was so deep that gardaí admit they would not have located Mr Brennan had Jack not remained by the side of the road. Gardaí later posted a photograph of Jack beside the ambulance which took Mr Brennan to hospital and the photograph was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. It shows Jack looking into the ambulance. The caption reads: “Man’s best friend. Elderly man out walking his dog last night near Portarlington fell into the ditch \u0026amp couldn’t get out. Jack the Dog stayed by his side \u0026amp showed Gardaí where he was. Even when ambulance arrived Jack wouldn’t rest unless he could see him!

When the ambulance came, Jack would not move for anybody until he saw Pat was in the ambulance. He’s a bit of a character is our Jack.” Mrs Brennan said she first noticed Jack when he started following her around the streets of Portarlingtonand then followed her home. She took him to the vet and had him chipped. Somebody claimed him, but the dog resurfaced on Facebook as its putative owner said he couldn’t look after him. She had Jack chipped and he was in a pound for 10 days before they adopted him. “He’s quite a young dog. He’s actually a pup,” Mrs Brennan told Midlands 103FM. “We have him completely ruined. You just can’t help it. He’s one of those dogs.” Jack was rewarded for his heroics with a lamb burger. “He’s such a lovely dog.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe .The European Commission has strongly emphasised the need to preserve a frictionless Border in Ireland if longstanding and extensive North-South cooperation is to be sustained. In a working paper published on Thursday, the commission’s task force on Brexit sets out an exercise conducted with the British last year in “mapping” some 147 North-South projects and programmes in the context of obligations on the UK arising from the Belfast Agreement. The UK published its summary of the work last December. The study became the basis of both the December 2016 Joint Declaration between the UK and the EU and subsequently of Article 13 of the Irish Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement. In both, the UK committed to sustain cross-Border projects emanating from the Belfast Agreement, and a British spokesman insisted on Thursday that the UK remains committed to upholding the Belfast Agreement “in all scenarios”. “It was consistently recognised that virtually all areas of North-South cooperation are predicated on the avoidance of a hard border including related customs or regulatory checks and controls,” the report says. In detailing areas of co-operation ranging from animal and plant standards, to cross-Border healthcare and environmental protection, the report warns that impediments on the Border threaten the viability of such projects. In the context of the danger of a no-deal Brexit in October, the report will strengthen the hand of those like the Irish Government who argue that the UK’s obligation to the controversial backstop goes back to the Belfast Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement including the Irish Protocol has been rejected three times by MPs in the House of Commons.

Running “roughshod” over Fianna Fáil would be a “mistake you’ll regret,” the Minister for Finance was warned during a heated Dáil row about funding for key infrastructure plans. Fianna Fáil’s public expenditure spokesman Barry Cowen on Thursday described Paschal Donohoe as the “Freddie Mercury of Irish politics, with your pint of magic stuff” when he accused the Minister of not being straight with the public over how cost overruns on some major projects would affect other capital expenditure plans.He said Mr Donohoe must have “magic money” and he reminded the Minister that he was in office because “we have the good grace to allow you be in Government”.During Dáil questions on public expenditure and reform on Thursday, Mr Cowen became irate when the Minister claimed the Fianna Fáil TD had done a U-turn on the National Development Plan.“You said the plan didn’t exist....You now hold the view that it is of such high value that it will make such a difference to people that you’re very eager to make sure it’s not affected at all,” Mr Donohoe told the Dáil.But rejecting the claim, the Offaly TD said he respected the commitments made in the plan and acknowledged the success and benefit it could provide.“I need to know the money is there to meet the promises you’re making when you’re not being straight with the Irish people,” he said.In an angry outburst Mr Cowen said: “I take exception to the point you’re making. . . . You’re playing roughshod with us and it’s a mistake you’ll regret”.The Minister had been questioned about how he would fund other capital projects in the context of the cost overruns at the national children’s hospital and the National Broadband Plan. Mr Donohoe said “it is my intention that no other projects will be affected as a result of decision to move ahead of national broadband plan”.He said there were other reasons projects could be delayed including the planning process, decisions Government departments make or the length of time of the tendering process.But he said if Mr Cowen did not like the Government’s approach to the broadband plan he would eventually have to put his own cards on the table. Mr Cowen replied: “you are in Government and you have responsibility and you have to make priorities on behalf of this Dáil because you have a majority. “Playing games with me about what I’d do or wouldn’t do is not up for discussion.”The Fianna Fail spokesman said independent appraisals of the plan “have said that your position is not credible and it’s very worrying that you haven’t sought to clarify your comments in relation to commitments you have made that no project would be affected”.Sinn Féin’s Jonathan O’Brien also raised the issue of cost overruns and said the Minister was stating “all projects will go ahead unless there are delays beyond budgetary reasons. All announced will go ahead none will be cut, none will be delayed for budgetary reasons.”He said: “If that is what you’re saying, €900 million in extra capital funding will be provided with no effect on projects already announced”. He said that was a lot of money and the Minister had not indicated where it was coming from.“You criticise ourselves and the Opposition for fantasy finances but you haven’t indicated where you’re going to find all this money.”He said “it’s not fair to criticise us for coming up with figures and you not to come up with figures yourself”.Mr Donohoe said he was confident the national finances were moving into a position of surplus and said there was scope in the context of projects that might be delayed for other reasons including planning permission, the tendering process or other issues."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3932068.1561032853!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sajid javid eliminated from tory leadership race as gove surges","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove: Now looking more likely to face Boris Johnson in the final two.  Photograph: Vickie FloresEPASajid Javid has been eliminated from the Tory leadership race after the fourth round of voting, with Michael Gove surprisingly edging ahead of Jeremy Hunt in the race to take on Boris Johnson in the final two. Mr Johnson comfortably topped the ballot on 157 votes, followed by Mr Gove with 61 and Mr Hunt with 59. Mr Javid was knocked out on 34 votes. Earlier Johnson has denied being involved in “dark arts” following claims his supporters were attempting to find a way to knock Mr Gove out of the race.There has been widespread speculation at Westminster that allies of Mr Johnson could lend support to Mr Javid, in order to force the environment secretary out of the race.Mr Gove’s decision to stand for the leadership in 2016 torpedoed Mr Johnson’s own campaign then, and the wounds have not healed.But asked if he knew anything about dark arts when he arrived to vote, Mr Johnson told reporters: “No.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, a supporter of Mr Johnson, said any “dirty tricks” by supporters of the former foreign secretary to try and knock Mr Gove out of the contest would be “silly”.He told the Press Association: “I think people should always vote for the candidate they support.“It is really silly to try and game elections because you can find that your candidate then loses.”Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who also backs Mr Johnson, said the only “dirty tricks” were that “MPs never tell you always the truth when it comes to leadership elections”.Asked if there was an underhand campaign against him, Mr Gove said: “I know there is a campaign for me with wonderful, wonderful people.”He added: “I’m looking forward to being in the final two as a result of the strong support I have across the party.”Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has finished second in all the votes so far, said he was “confident, but not over-confident”.Members’ voteAfter a final fifth round of voting later on Thursday, just two candidates will remain in the race and they will go on to a ballot of 160,000 Tory members to choose the next prime minister.Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who supports Mr Hunt, urged Mr Johnson to publicly come out against “game-playing” in the Tory leadership race.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I find all this conversation about lending votes rather discrediting of the system.“I would really call on Boris himself to repudiate the information that is coming out of ‘friends of Boris’, saying this, saying one thing.”The work and pensions secretary added: “This is a serious moment. We don’t need that sort of game-playing going on in parliament.”Eliminated Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart has said he will not publicly back any of the remaining contenders on Thursday.He has scheduled his own “thank you rally” for supporters at the time the announcement of the final pair is due to be made at 6pm.He tweeted: “I will not be declaring for anyone today – but I will be voting.” – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

This small, dynamic NGO, deploys teams of ex-military, first responders and committed civilians into the heart of natural disasters.Most recently in Mozambique, Team Rubicon’s unique approach and expertise alleviated the desperate circumstances of over 177, 000 people in dire need.  We tackle the challenges that larger charities cannot.But I am frustrated.More than £18 million was raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee from the ever generous British public for humanitarian efforts in Mozambique but Team Rubicon did not see a penny of it.Nor can we access Government funding. DfID spent 75 per cent of the £14.5 billion Official Development Assistance budget last year but Team Rubicon got nothing.Ever get the feeling that the bank will only lend you money when you have it, not when you need it? During the response phase, Team Rubicon delivered 60 per cent of the remote aid outside of Beira in Mozambique but DfID focused solely on the largest NGOs, granting hundreds of millions – they don’t want to support us because we don’t fit their conventional model.Eye of the storm | Hunger stalks a shattered nationTheir strict criteria and stringent processes are, I grant,  reassuring for taxpayers but their approach to funding the very small (less than £250K income) or the very big (at least £10M in reserves) leaves Team Rubicon and our former military and emergency services personnel out in the cold. We\u0027re a young charity but the concept is proven. The larger NGOs do amazing work operate on a staggering scale and are not the target of my frustration – but they need smaller-scale delivery partners if victims are to be properly served in the challenging circumstances that are created by natural disasters. Our people thrive in ‘challenging’, they are built for it and have proved themselves capable and responsive in those environments many times already. Team Rubicon bridges a gap between immediate search and rescue operations and longer term recovery.  Our people load up their backpacks and walk in. They navigate devastated terrain to reach remote communities who would otherwise wait weeks or months for assistance after a natural disaster. Many communities are abandoned to their fate – because they are too hard to reach.In Mozambique our teams of four not only found these forgotten communities they sourced the aid and delivered it by helicopter, truck, motorbike or foot. Many had been without clean drinking water for weeks so our teams carried in portable water purification systems which they then instructed the local people how to use so they could move on to the next task. In emergencies like these, interventions of this nature can be life-saving.Sebastian Rhodes Stamper of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Mozambique, said: “Team Rubicon UK is a critical component of the broader response throughout the affected area. They bring with them determination, drive, professionalism and a highly commendable ‘can-do’ attitude. In short, Team Rubicon UK is a real asset here and is making an extraordinary difference.”Why does this matter? In the last 30 years, more than 2.5 million people have died and over 3 trillion pounds has been lost because of natural disasters. The World Bank reports that almost 75 per cent of the losses are attributable to extreme weather events.We need to get our response right, but Team Rubicon doesn’t just respond when things go wrong –  it’s trying to stop the rot and its disaster risk reduction programmes can help reverse the current trend of rising disaster impact both physically and financially.Cyclone Idai | Clinging to lifePost response and recovery, Team Rubicon\u0027s programmes address the continued human suffering that remains, often for prolonged periods of time. In 2018 there were communities in Lapabesi, Nepal which still had no power three years after the earthquake, relying on kerosene lamps – the equivalent of smoking 20 cigarettes a day. We provided solar power because our teams put the equipment on their backs and carried it through the mountains.We have trained communities in the Caribbean hot to protect their way of life and return to normality more quickly.  In Indonesia and Nepal, we have been able to assist where other International Aid agencies could not. And we are looking at proactive, life changing projects in the DR Congo, Sierra Leone and the BVI.Why should you care? Because we do not, and must not, abandon people who are suffering unimaginable hardship and loss from climate change and natural disasters, simply because of the vagaries of birth and geography. Throughout my life I have worked with those who walk towards danger or suffering to help fellow human beings and it humbles me that Team Rubicon is willing to do it still. And they are volunteers!It cost us £1.01 to help each of the 178,000 people in Mozambique. We cut costs on delivery wherever we could – our teams’ mantras being ‘we are spending your mother’s money’Team Rubicon UK is the plucky underdog swimming with the big dogs and punching way above its weight. It represents the best of Great Britain’s compassion and moral conscience yet despite our best efforts the Government has no desire to support us.There is extraordinary growth potential. With £5 million we could respond to nine UN emergency response deployments plus 10 other international disaster relief operations. It could provide another 2250 Team Rubicon volunteers and cover all training, deployment and operational costs. It would mean we could reach 3.2 million people in need.Five million out of our £14.5 billion UK aid budget doesn’t sound very much when you look at it like that, does it?General Sir Nick Parker is Chairman of Team Rubicon UK  and a former Commander in Chief of UK Land ForcesProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Department for International DevelopmentTory leadership latest: Sajid Javid eliminated from leadership race as Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy HuntRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39ignored\u0026#39 child sex abuse victims to protect church, report findsFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskComment: All political parties should follow Change UK\u0026#39s example and adopt the IHRA definition of anti-SemitismComment: Boris is tragically mistaken if he thinks he can strike a deal with Brussels nowJapanese nuclear plant sparks panic after ticking wrong box on fax in wake of earthquakeJeremy Wright postpones UK\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites delayed for six months after \u0026#39administrative error\u0026#39Head of London Fire Brigade announces plan to quit ahead of \u0026#39critical\u0026#39 Grenfell inquiry reportWho could replace Jean-Claude Junker?

It\u0027s a wonderful discovery, said Pierre Benedetti, chief environmental technician of the National Hunting and Wildlife Office (ONCFS).We believe that it\u0027s a wild natural species which was known but not scientifically identified because it\u0027s an extremely inconspicuous animal with nocturnal habits,” he told AFP.Dubbed Ghjattu volpe” by locals and found in the island’s Asco forest, the furry creature resembles a domestic cat in many ways but has distinguishing features, including a black-tipped tail with two to four rings, very wide ears, short whiskers and highly developed canine teeth. Researchers hope to have the \u0026#34fox-cat\u0026#34 recognised and protected within four yearsMeasuring around a metre from head to tail, it has stripes on the front legs, very dark hind legs and a russet stomach. Experts say its silky coat is a natural repellent for fleas, ticks and lice. It\u0027s their size and their tail that earned them the name \u0027cat-fox\u0027 across the island, said Mr Benedetti.The cat-fox is thought to have taken residence in such a remote habitat as it offers water and plant cover from its main predator, the golden eagle.Researchers perfected a method of attracting the creatures to a stick daubed in essence on which it left fur.By looking at its DNA, we could tell it apart from the European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris. It\u0027s close to the African forest cat, Felis  silvestris lybica, but its exact identity is still to be determined, Mr Benedetti told AFP.  Using nonviolent methods, the ONCFS captured their first cat-fox in 2016 and have now caught 12 from among 16 felines seen in the area, releasing them swiftly after examination.Officially the creature has not been declared a new species and sceptics suggest it may simply be a cross between a domestic cat from Corsica and neighbouring Sardinia.But the researchers disagree and say they hope to have this cat recognised and protected within two to four years.The cat-fox is part of our shepherd mythology. From generation to generation, they told stories of how the forest cats would attack the udders of their ewes and goats, said Carlu-Antone Cecchini, ONCFS field agent in charge of forest cats.How it ended up in Corsica is unclear, though one theory is that it was brought to the island of beauty by farmers 6,500 years BC. If the hypothesis is true, its origins are Middle Eastern, said Mr Benedetti.Tory leadership latest: Sajid Javid eliminated from leadership race as Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy HuntRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39ignored\u0026#39 child sex abuse victims to protect church, report findsFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskComment: All political parties should follow Change UK\u0026#39s example and adopt the IHRA definition of anti-SemitismComment: Boris is tragically mistaken if he thinks he can strike a deal with Brussels nowJapanese nuclear plant sparks panic after ticking wrong box on fax in wake of earthquakeJeremy Wright postpones UK\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites delayed for six months after \u0026#39administrative error\u0026#39Head of London Fire Brigade announces plan to quit ahead of \u0026#39critical\u0026#39 Grenfell inquiry reportWho could replace Jean-Claude Junker?

Unfortunately, TEPCO staff had ticked the wrong box on the form and informed prefectural authorities that an anomaly had been detected in the reactors.The document was handed to Masahiro Sakurai, the mayor of Kashiwazaki, who - with the March 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant still fresh in the memory - immediately ordered his staff to determine the scale of the problem and the measures that TEPCO was taking.Seventeen minutes after the fax was sent, officials at TEPCO’s headquarters in Tokyo noticed the error and released a correction emphasising that the reactors had not been damaged.Shops and homes were damaged by the tremorsTEPCO - which also operated the Fukushima plant and was widely criticised in subsequent inquiries into the 2011 disaster - has confirmed that the initial message had been checked by another official at the plant before it was sent, but there has been no explanation as to how the error was not noticed.Despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries on the planet, many Japanese firms still prefer to communicate via fax.In a statement to The , TEPCO confirmed that employees “mistakenly shared incorrect information when they checked a box indicating there was a power supply abnormality related to the cooling of the spent fuel pool when, in fact, there was no such abnormality.“We sincerely regret the error. TEPCO is looking into the cause and will consider measures going forward”.Mr Sakurai has condemned the operator’s errors.Fukushima: Tokyo was on the brink of catastrophe“When a real earthquake is happening, not a drill, this is a massive error”, he told local reporters.“It is extremely poor on their part to make errors with the most important and basic information at a time of crisis”, the Asahi Shimbun reported.TEPCO has issued an apology and stated that it will not make the same mistake again.The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was only 12 miles from the epicentre of a magnitude 6.6 quake in July 2007 that shook the facility beyond its design capabilities, causing widespread damage but no leak of nuclear material.The plant was shut for 21 months and underwent seismic upgrades, although it has again been shut down for additional improvements and assessments since the Fukushima disaster.Tuesday’s earthquake left 26 people injured and caused damage to buildings and infrastructure in towns along the Sea of Japan coast. Meteorological authorities issued a tsunami warning but the alert was lifted after waves of around 4 inches were recorded.Tory leadership latest: Sajid Javid eliminated from leadership race as Michael Gove overtakes Jeremy HuntRoyal charity split: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to leave Royal Foundation UK\u0026#39s most senior Catholic \u0026#39ignored\u0026#39 child sex abuse victims to protect church, report findsFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFrench claim discovery of new ‘cat-fox’ species in Corsican forestCruise ships ‘seized by Russian authorities’, putting hundreds of holidays at riskComment: All political parties should follow Change UK\u0026#39s example and adopt the IHRA definition of anti-SemitismComment: Boris is tragically mistaken if he thinks he can strike a deal with Brussels nowJeremy Wright postpones UK\u0026#39s ban on under 18s using porn sites delayed for six months after \u0026#39administrative error\u0026#39Head of London Fire Brigade announces plan to quit ahead of \u0026#39critical\u0026#39 Grenfell inquiry reportWho could replace Jean-Claude Junker?

In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.Johnson comfortably topped the poll from the first round of voting, securing  votes from his colleagues.This is well above the  needed to guarantee his place in the final two, making him a firm favourite as it stands.But supporters were reminded that only once in the history of the Conservative party has the favourite ever been elected.The Foreign Secretary who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum is the second favourite for leader.Jeremy Hunt claims his business background would help him negotiate a good deal with Brussels as doing deals is my bread and butter as someone who has set up their own business.The -year-old said he would back a No Deal Brexit with a heavy heartit was the only option left.Hunt has said he wants to slash corporation tax to boost businesses.On June  he claimed Germany’s Angela Merkel COULD renegotiate Brexit with a new Tory PM.He has the backing of Amber Rudd.While in second place after the first round vote, Hunt is trailing far behind Johnson with only just over a third of his share.But Amber Rudd, who is backing Hunt, said he came a good second and was delighted with the result.The Environment Secretary announced his bid to be the next Prime Minister on June .Michael Gove has said he is willing to delay Brexit for as long as needed to ensure a deal is agreed rather than just crashing out on October .He is posing as a unying candidate and said: I believe that Im ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country.Gove notably defended Theresa Mays Brexit deal in the House of Commons.However, his chances may have been dented by his cocaine admission.After the first round, Gove came a close third after Hunt and Johnson with  votes.The Home Secretary announced his candidacy in a video on Twitter and was one of the Remain campaigners in .Sajid Javid, , has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit but has positioned himself as a firm Remainer.But speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday he said: The policy of any government I lead will be to leave on  October. We will do everything in our power to leave on  October.I will do everything I can to get a deal, butI have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal.If elected the Bromsgrove MP would be the UKs first Prime Minister from an ethnic minority.He has pledged to end austerity and pump billions into education.Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson has given him her support.It is thought defeated Andrea Leadsom could back Sajid Javid after he secured  votes in the first round.In a moving message the Home Secretary insisted he was ideally placed to lead a Conservative Government that would aim to bring people from all sides together.He said: “We talked a moment ago about whether someone is Remain or Leave, whether someone is black or white, North or South, urban or rural, and whatever happens this is the number one thing, we have to address in our countrywe are staying together as a cohesive society.“I think it is incumbent upon all politicians, especially when we see around the world, in the US, Italy and others, there are politicians that want to feed off anger and feed off ision, that we as Conservatives always look at the best in people and try to bring them together.”He said he had lived with prejudice for most of his le – but believed Britain was the “most successful multi-racial democracy in the world”.The new International Development Secretary launched his leadership bid in The Spectator and has since told of his one-time opium use.The Penrith MP has been scathing about a No Deal Brexit and claimed it would be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest.Rory Stewart has outlined his intention to fulfil Brexit and use a citizens assembly and a grand jury to help parliament to hammer out a deal with the EU that works for the country.Stewart believes a No Deal Brexit would cause huge financial implications for Brexit and is focused on a practical deal.He said he would lock up MPs over the summer to get the deal done.Hes also said hell build two million new homes.Apparently undeterred by winning only  votes in the first round, Stewarts insists hes the only one who can stop Boris Johnson in the PM race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Naturally, with the age-old adage of “tidy room, tidy mind” at the forefront of their smugly neat brains, plenty will make the leap that Boris’s untidiness makes him unsuitable to lead the country.His many critics might also throw in the other car-related evidence that, when he was GQ’s motoring correspondent, he accrued enough parking tickets to paper a downstairs loo and frequently misplaced the vehicle he’d been loaned.A potential PM needs to be across the small print of every situation, they argue, and Boris is just too “chaotic” to do so. But is that true  After all, Gordon Brown and Theresa May were sticklers for detail and look what happened to them.So perhaps it’s time for a “bigger picture” personality with the strength of character to lead the country through a series of inevitably dficult decisions while leaving the crossing of Ts etc to several trusted lieutenants.According to journalist Andrew Gilligan, who worked for Boris when he was Mayor of London, his former boss has the “factory setting” of one nation Toryism and the ability to “master detail whenever he wanted to” but seldom wanted to.“A leader’s job,” Gilligan adds, “is to set the general direction and tone, choose the right people and inspire them to implement it. Lots of folk can do detail.”My friends would tell you that, despite the chaotic mess of my office at home , I possess clarity of thought when it comes to work and le’s general admin.So let’s hope that,he becomes PM, Boris is the same.

But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party.

The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it.

I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont want to belittle anybody but it wont deter me.This protest does make me sympathise with the overall vegan community, because its not doing them any favours and many of them want to promote a peaceful existence.The Vegan Society said veganism is based on kindness and compassion, and that any extremists are not representative of the movement.It added: As much as we sympathise with the activists who allegedly put up the signs, we do not consider this approach to be an effective way to promote veganism as an ethics-driven lestyle. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is however unclear whether government is achieving its objectives in the  UK Aid Strategy.“Government does not know whether giving responsibility for spending ODA to a larger number of departments has had the impact it intended. And its progress in improving the transparency of spending has been slow.“While there is good evidence that many aid programmes are securing an impact inidually, government does not know whether all parts of ODA, taken together, are securing value for money.”The reports piled pressure on Aid Secretary and Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart.Responding to the reports he said last night: “The NAO report raises questions about how aid is spent across government.“So I will be working closely with my colleagues in other aid-spending departments to support them and ensure they benefit from DfID’s expertise.

lips","story":"Her clients complained of lopsided trout pouts, the result of use of a “dangerous gel” she imported “by the bucketload from Ukraine”.Among -year-old Natalia Korosteleva’s clients were actresses who lost key stage parts after their looks were “ruined” in botched lip augmentation procedures, a Moscow court heard.One testied her cheeks were left “swollen like a hamster” later requiring  surgical operations to recover.A music TV presenter had a nervous breakdown after suffering a permanently disfigured face.The court found Korosteleva was injecting her patients with liquid silicone and a hazardous bipolymer gel banned in Russia and most other countries, resulting in chronic inflammation and oedemas – fluid buildup under the skin causing severe pain.Russian state investigator Kirill Revyakov said:“You can seal a hole in the wall with this gel, but in no way use it on the lips and face.“The consequences are terrible, including the destruction of the facial muscles.…“She injected this into her clients under the guise of safe hyaluronic acid.”In the UKPolice seized eight fake medical diplomas from her home operating theatre near Moscow and discovered Korosteleva had no qualications or licenses to offer surgical treatments.She was convicted and jailed over  cases but the true number of her “victims” runs up to , say police.Two aides named Soniyat Yaikbaeva and Ekaterina Egorova were given suspended sentences.Korosteleva used a gel for lip and facial filling that had been long ago banned in most countries including Russia.An actress named as Irina Sokolova said she had treatment on her lips by the fake medic.“My face became completely ugly,” she said.“The gel accumulated and swelled inside.“Some pieces broke off and moved along my face under the skin.“My cheeks were swollen like a hamster, everything hurt.”She said: “I went through pain, humiliation, fear.“I had to sacrice my career - for the main roles, you need a perfect face.Another victim named Valentina Barysheva was left with a changed nose and painful swollen cheeks.She revealed some women patients had been left too “severely injured” to appear in court.“It is the slow murder of a person,” she claimed.“I visited her twice, and underwent surgery,“Very soon after the injections my face swelled.“I could not leave the house for a month, even to walk my dog, as people stared and shied away from me.”After a year, her eyes hardly opened due to a large oedema.Actress Svetlana Yastrebova could no longer get major parts on stage after undergoing facial treatment with Korosteleva, say reports.Victim Yekaterina Lantsova said her treatment led to her having “a huge mouth and my lips became asymmetric”.The upper lip was sloping down towards my chin”.There were allegations that Korosteleva had “protection” from a senior police figure, enabling her to avoid justice and harm more women.After intense pressure from her victims, she went on the run for three weeks before fainting at a railway station when she as eventually detained by police.Another beautician who had a practice near Korosteleva revealed how the fake doctor imported banned gel from Ukraine and flouted basic hygiene rules.After she was detained, the bogus beautician admitted she had only school leaving qualications and no medical degrees or diplomas.She claimed to police that her grandmother had been a doctor “so she knew what to do”.UK law currently allows anyone to administer injectible cosmetic products.According to figures from ITV News, botched lip-jobs make up for  per cent of all corrective work, and almost half of procedures that were corrected were carried out by beauticians as opposed to medical professionals.The Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners , a self-regulating body for the non-surgical aesthetics industry in England,takes issue with the level of teaching carried out at training centres for cosmetic fillers, insisting it it has become lax and that standards are not high enough.  Theres currently no legal requirement to report mistakeslip fillers or other cosmetic fillers go wrong.The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons , a

levels","story":"Theyre also all the classic signs of hay fever and those are only worsened by rising pollen levels.A so-called pollen bomb has exploded across the UK this week - with levels reaching very high for most of the country.Pretty bad newsyoure one of the estimated  million hay fever sufferers in Britain.But is it a legitimate reason to take time off work For those lucky enough not to get hay fever, it may seem a ridiculous suggestion - nothing more than a pathetic excuse.But in severe cases, the allergy can trigger deadly asthma attacks, with others left unable to drive and operate machinery due to their symptoms and the drugs they have to take to try to get some relief.Allergy expert Dr Jean Emberlin previously told The Sun: If symptoms are severe enough to impact your ability to do your job, certainly take a day off sick.Depending on what your job is, having very watery eyes or frequently sneezing may have a signicant enough bearing on your ability to perform at the required level.And in those cases, taking a day off work is a necessary measure.Another key point is that evenpeople arent off work as a result of their hay fever, their productivity may be adversely affected by their symptoms, meaning the impact of hay fever on work extends further than missed days.But she said,you are forced to take time off work with hay fever, it is important to see a GP or pharmacist, to ensure you have the right medication.And Dr Emberlin said its worth remembering hay fever symptoms, while they feel a lot like a nasty cold, arent contagious so theres no need to worry about spreading the misery.If your job involves lots of driving and your hay fever is causing your eyes to stream and you to sneeze frequently, that is certainly bad enough not to go to work, she added.Hay fever can be very debilitating for sufferers, interfering with all aspects of work, family and your social le.For teenagers at this time of the year, it can impact on their performance in exams or at sporting events.And it can trigger asthma, in severe cases.If its not managed properly, hay fever can evolve into asthma, Dr Emberlin said.This is obviously a serious condition, with signicant health and lestyle implications.Hay fever can also be bad news for the estimated .million people with asthma in the UK  - as pollen can trigger their asthma.Dr Andy Whittamore, GP and Clinical Lead at Asthma UK warned that high levels of pollen in the air can inflame the airways and spark a potentially fatal attack.He previously told The Sun: When pollen is in the air it can inflame people’s airways, triggering asthma symptoms.Stormy weather can make it worse as it breaks the pollen into much smaller particles, which are then inhaled more deeply into the lungs.“If you have asthma and are already noticing more symptoms because of hay fever, such as coughing, a tight chest or breathlessness, make sure you keep your blue reliever inhaler with you at all times.Dr Whittamore advises taking hay fever medicines and using the preventer inhaler - usually brown - as prescribed.Experts predict a million new people will develop an allergy to pollen this summer.An estimated  per cent of adults in the UK reported suffering from hay fever in , according to research.Last year that figure increased to  per cent with a million new people buying hay fever medicines and remedies for the first time.The rise is believed to be due to changes in our climate as weather conditions become more extreme clearly defined seasons are blurred.Experts say a long winter followed by a short spring condensed the flowering season of trees and shrubs into a much shorter time period.They say this causes a so-called pollen bomb as plants burst into le at the same time."},{"url":null,"title":"politicians briefings ufos government sightings seriously","story":"The Senators on the Intelligence Committee were given the briefing about a series of encounters between US Navy planes and unidentied aircraft, one of them has said.A spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed the briefing took place.“If naval pilots are running into unexplained interference in the air, that’s a safety concern Senator Warner believes we need to get to the bottom of,” Rachel Cohen told Politico.Donald Trump said he too has been briefed on UFOs but admitted he doesnt believe in them.The Navy itself didn’t comment on the latest meeting but has in the past confirmed that it provides briefings for the Congressional members by Naval Intelligence officials as well as aviators.Earlier this year, the Navy revealed there have been reported sightings of UFOs hovering above top-secret military bases and flying near aircraft.The daily sightings came over the course of  and  and were reported to the Pentagon and Congress.Briefing requests by Congress members have been on the increase since it was revealed  the Pentagon’s shadowy Aerospace Threat Identication Programstill investigates UFO sightings, the New York Post reported.He also says there have been more than , recorded UFO sightings in the past -plus years.The first recorded flyby occurred in Portland in , where viewers reported seeing a “buzzing” sphere-shaped UFO that descended from the heavens.Sightings have spiked dramatically over the past -plus years with mysterious lights taking over from saucers as the most popular description of objects spotted.The National UFO Reporting Centre is an organisation that investigates sightings.Since it was set up in , reports have been sent to it via its  hour hotline and it says that between May and June this year there have been more than  new sightings.The United States collectively reports , sightings per  million people, which is  times more than the global median. The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .At the time, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took credit for arranging  million in annual funding for the AATIP, telling the New York Times that it was “one of the good things I did in my congressional service.”The service is drafting new guidelines for pilots and other naval employees so its easier for them to report any mysterious objects they spot in the sky.A few years ago, a leaked report from the Pentagon revealed that a supersonic UFO shaped like a Tic Tac sweet had stalked a US Aircraft carrier for days before vanishing into thin air.Some of the pilots said that the aircraft could make itself invisible as it travelled next to them.The craft was described by one of the pilots mentioned in the report as solid white, smooth, with no edges... unormly coloured with no nacelles, pylons or wings, and looked like an elongated egg or Tic Tac.Sceptics think that the sighting could be explained by equipment mal or human

It’d be Britain the “do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do” years.An horric thought that certainly added a bit of perspective to the penultimate episode of Years And Years, which was written by Doctor Who’s Russell T Davies in a fit of anti-Brexit Trump rage, thereby guaranteeing it would age about as well as Neil “Razor” Ruddock.The blasé assumption that went with it was that this series would be one of ’s big hits, so I won’t pretend the fact it’s died like the proverbial flea in a Russian’s beard hasn’t given me a lot of pleasure.It will have been a huge shock, though, to the BBC because, on the face of things, it was a bold and imaginative idea to travel ten years into the future with “an ordinary, everyday” family like the Lyons.Or it was up to the point when it became clear they were the sort of “ordinary, everyday” family who lived in a million-pound mansion and had more ticked boxes than Stephen Hawking’s homework.They were mixed race, naturally. One daughter was a lesbian left-wing activist, another was in a wheelchair, there was a gay son, with a refugee boyfriend, a cross-dressing nephew and niece who was “trans-human” and could take photos by blinking her eyes. All of them were bloody insufferable.The plot didn’t offer a lot of joy or surprises either, as it began with Donald Trump starting a nuclear war. An idea that secretly thrills all thosereaders who long to shout: “I TOLD YOU SO.”Armageddon quickly fizzled out, though, and was replaced by the melting of the North Pole, bananas becoming extinct, poor people being banned from London’s Kensington, Biblical downpours of rain and the Ukraine causing a refugee crisis when its Christian regime started arresting homosexuals, as Christian regimes so often don’t.Ben Shephard: “What is the fth letter of the alphabet ” Faith: “F.”And Love Island, Tommy: “What year did World War One start ” Molly-Mae: “.”Cheerful and brave, it most certainly wasn’t. The BBC doesn’t get a real buzz, though, unless it’s sticking it to the mother country.  So, on last week’s episode, Viv Rook became PM and immediately started planning genocide on asylum seekers. It’s not an original drama idea, obviously.Dennis Potter did the groundwork for Davies in Brimstone  Treacle, over  years ago. On Years And Years, however, plot twists come with a gear-crunching speech or a history lesson, spelled out here by the Thompson character.The thing about giving history lessons, though, is you’ve got to get them right. Years And Years didn’t.Simple Googling would’ve told the BBC concentration camps were actually a Spanish invention, during the Cuban wars of independence, and forced labour dates back centuries.I suspect they didn’t bother because the BBC and Russell T Davies are both so full of self-loathing they want to believe the worst things they hear about their own country.If you didn’t pick up that contempt for the audience from Years And Years last week, you certainly will have got a sense of it from the fact the BBC decided to land .million people over the age of  with a £. bill for the licence.It’s unlikely anyone would volunteer to pay that sort of money to endure the Years And Years lecture, no matter what it conjures up in tonight’s finale.Though how the hell it ever survived to , under the current management, will be the real mystery for most viewers.Shelley Kerr: “The one thing we want to do is win or get a draw.”Claire Rafferty: “England need more of the same but dferent.”Rachel Brown-Finnis: “Phil Neville is the female version of Gareth Southgate.” He is .LONG, cold evenings in a Highland yurt, staring at the same ruddy animals year after year, can lead presenters down all sorts of weird television cul-de-sacs.Take, for instance, Springwatch’s Michaela Strachan who, after a couple of weeks huddled in the Cairngorms, on BBC, suddenly piped up with some hot news about: “Starling testicles.”Yes. Starling testicles, which are a bit like Aston Villa, apparently.  Timid, puny little things in the winter but quite magnicent come the spring.A fact that led Michaela to wonderviewers could “imagine flying round with testicles the size of a bean ”  I could, and it quite took the thrill out of my new superpower, I can tell you.If that wasn’t a vivid enough image for you, though, co-host Chris Packham was on hand with a starling testicle-size graph and a prop, to tell her thathuman testicles swelled to the same scale, they’d be the size of basketballs.“And that’s quite a thing to get your head around, isn’t it ”I’ll take your word for it, Michaela.HAVING gone absolutely nowhere for over a week, Love Island was transformed on Wednesday by the arrival of a heat-seeking missile in human form. She’s Maura Higgins, an Irish “ring girl”. A description you can interpret pretty much any way you like.Because she may look like one of The Corrs, but Maura has a gob on her like Father Jack and, within five minutes of meeting Molly-Mae’s partner Tommy, was telling anyone who’d listen: “I swear to God, the things I’d do to that man. ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy, Tommy’. I can imagine screaming his name already.”That was just for starters, though.By Thursday, Maura was announcing her intention to “wrap my legs round his head”, which Tommy said was “doing a -degree turn”, without any danger of cutting off the blood supply to his brain.

Mr Johnson has never forgiven Mr Gove for kning him out of the  leadership race after previously vowing to be his running mate.

I would really call on Boris himself to repudiate the information that is coming out of aposfriends of Borisapos, saying this, saying one thing, she told the BBC. This is a serious moment.

Meanwhile Rory Stewart also accused Boris Johnsonaposs team of dark arts before his total mysteriously dropped from  to  last night. But after the result he told ITVaposs Peston: I donapost think it was dirty tricks by Boris. I think what happened is that somehow some combination of my message and momentum convinced the other camps to tighten up, so I think most of my votes will have gone to Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt and some to Sajid. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to warn the next Prime Minister he will have to call an election or a second referendum to break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament.Mr Hammond is set to urge the remaining leadership candidates to be “honest with the public” about the risks of no-deal. Heaposll also say the £bn put aside in the economy wonapost be available to cut taxes or boost spendingthereaposs No Deal. In a speech in London, he is expected to say: “It may be that I’m wrong, and a new leader will persuade Parliament to accept the deal it has already rejected. “Or that the European Union does a -degree U-turn and re-opens the Withdrawal Agreement. ButI’m not,the deal the current PM has negotiated is, in fact, the best deal possible - and Parliament continues to reject both it and No Deal, then the question to the candidates is not “What is your plan ” but “What is your plan B ”. “If the new Prime Minister cannot end the deadlock in Parliament, then he will have to explore other democratic mechanisms to break the impasse. “Becausehe fails, his job will be on the line – and so, too, will the jobs and prosperity of millions of our fellow citizens.”  Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has spoken out against no-deal-Brexit backers as EU leaders prepare to meet in Brussels. He said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK. Mr Rutte told the BBCaposs Today programme: With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country. It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable.

Empty words THE hollow promises of Theresa May were exposed yesterday when she was challenged by Jeremy Corbyn on the Government’s response to the Grenfell tragedy. The Labour leader, who praised our Never Again campaign, asked the PM to explain why hundreds of blocks still have dangerous cladding. He also wanted to know why sprinklers had not been retrofitted and why no action was taken to improve tenants’ rights. Mrs May failed to answer any questions. In the wake of the disaster, she vowed to do everything she could to keep people safe.    Her record tells a dferent story. Fire regulations have not been updated, tenants are still denied a voice and firefighter numbers have been cut. Sympathetic words are not enough.

The couple have now been forced to move out of their home on the River Bure at Horning in Norfolk, while they wait to find out whether it will have to be demolished.    Signs have been erected around the property with the words Danger. Unsafe. Ken said there had been no warning signs that the west side of their home starting to sink and that it simply happened overnight, leaving them devastated. He and his we declined to speak further and said they are working with their insurers to try and find a resolution.

So sad to see this. The three-bedroom house offers a large garden with a river frontage, along with allocated boat mooring and fishing opportunities.

Over the last five years  properties have been sold on the road in the village which has shops, pubs and restaurants.    A Broads Authority spokesman said: It is a huge shame that this lovely cottage appears to be in such a precarious position. Unfortunately it is something that can be an ongoing danger for properties built on unstable ground. We wish the owners all the best as they assess what can be done.

But this year Kate has surpassed herself and her fashion choices have garnered more praise than ever. Subtle changes have meant she has grown into her style as the mother-of-three has become older – and gained more confidence. While not deviating far from her signature style, she has modernised it. Kate has clearly widened her scope of go-to designers, making way for some more daring choices. Stepping out in labels like Gucci, Missoni and Elie Saab have added to the opinion she’s having a “fashion moment”.  The stunning dusky pink Gucci chfon gown she wore to the VA in February was Oscar-worthy. And Tuesday’s cornflower blue Elie Saab gown for Ascot was another sign that Kate is enjoying experimenting with new styles. Susan Kelly from website whatkatewore, says: “The Duchess’s style has been more fashion-forward over the last six to  months and there is one term that sums up Kate exploring more adventurous styles: self-confidence.”  When the Duchess wore a Gucci pussy-bow blouse everyone assumed she’s worn it back to front by mistake. But it was a confident styling decision made by Kate, who thought it looked better the other way round. A fitted green Emilia Wickstead dress was another fashion highlight. But it’s not just her formal wear that has been transformed, she also looked every inch the off-duty mum as she unveiled her Back to Nature Garden at this year’s Cha Flower Show in a pair of Massimo Dutti culottes with a crisp white MIH floral shirt and a pair of Superga plimsols.  Later that day she changed into a distinctive, longline Erdem dress teamed with a pair of casual wedges. This year has also seen Kate be more confident in trousers. She showed she can still shine dressed down in a blue jacket and her faithful knee-high Penelope Chilvers boots while she also paired skinny jeans with a red jacket and heels for a trip to North Wales.  Susan adds: “The Duchess not only looks comfortable with her public commitments she looks like she is flourishing.” Some have attributed her new oomph to her new stylist Ginnie Chadwyck-Healey who is covering her long-time PA and stylist Natasha Archer while she’s on maternity leave. Kate has traded in her trusty nude court shoes for elegant designer heels. She chose a sparkly pair of Jimmy Choos when she recycled a Barbara Casasola dress to a charity dinnerthis month.And a polka dot Alessandra Rich silk dress worn was highlighted by a pair of powder blue Gianvito Rossi shoes.  While Kate’s heel height may have gone up, her hemlines seem to have come down as she has found her right dress coat– wearing them slightly lower on the knee. Far from radically changing her style it could simply be the case that she’s just settled into it...

On May  Nathaniel Holmes and Cynthia Ann Day were found dead in their room at the Bahia Principe hotel in the Dominican Republic. The couple were the third and fourth US citizens to die at the hotel, with further deaths in nearby resorts brining the total American death toll on the island to nine in a year. With cops investigating whether the deaths are linked to counterfeit booze stored in the hotel minibars, two Brits are terried theyaposve been poisoned.    Since they ed from the Bahia Principe hotel - where four tourists died with two reportedly drinking from the minibars - Emma Plappert and boyfriend Leigh Bailey have had serious health concerns. As well as crippling stomach pains, intense exhaustion and red lumps on their legs, they have endured bloody diarrhea after flying back to their home in Southend, Essex on May . When they heard the mysterious deaths could be linked to alcohol miniatures, the couple rushed to retrieve bottles they had taken from their minibar and gted to friends at home. Luckily they got the bottles back before theyaposd been opened. Now Emma and Leigh are calling on UK authorities to test the alcohol as they continue to battle their mystery illness.    The first thing we noticed that was strange was the alcohol from the main hotel bar, explained Emma, who forked out £, for the two week holiday after Leigh won £, on the slots. It just didnapost taste like alcohol at all. It just tasted weird. I said at the time that they had put fake alcohol in it. It tasted a bit chemically. Several days into the holiday the -year-old woke up in the middle of the night to a strange sulfurous smell in her room. Mum of three Emma said: I woke up and it smelt like rancid rotten eggs. I think it was coming through the air conditioning. I started to think of chemical gasses. I was really scared. After that I had the worst tummy ache of my le.    Numerous people have reported strange smells at the Bahia Principe Hotel including Philadelphia couple Doug Hand and Susie Lauterborn.After staying at the resort Susie told CBS Local how she had rashes on her torso, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a temperature over  degrees, which she first put down to food poisoning.She reported off tasting wine and pasta like battery acid. When a Maryland couple died at the hotel of what Dominican Republic National police said was respiratory failure and excess fluid in the lungs however, Susie got suspicious. She said: Maybe there’s something deeper here. It’s really crazy to hear that people had passed away. “I don’t think it’s just limited to those people either. I bet with some further investigating, they’ll find out that way more people that visited that place got sick or even died.”  The first death occurred in June last year when bride-to-be Yvette Monique Sport had a drink at the minibar of the Bahia Principe hotel, took a shower and then went to bed. Her fiance was unable to rouse her when he came to wake the -year-old from Glenside, Pennsylvania.  Almost a year later on May  Miranda Schaup-Werner, a -year-old from Allentown, Pennsylvania, collapsed and died suddenly on May  in her room at Bahia Príncipe hotel. She also had just had a drink from the minibar.  Just five days later Nathaniel Holmes, , and Cynthia Ann Day, , died at the same hotel inside their rooms. They reportedly suffered from respiratory failure and pulmonary edema according to an early autopsy, although their families members are pushing for a second opinion back in the US.  Emma stopped brushing off fears about her illness and offers from her dad to take her to hospital when she became aware of the deaths. People kept saying aposgo to the doctorsapos and I kept saying aposI know, I knowapos, she continued. Then people started dying and I began to get really worried. Iaposm really scared now, but we are the lucky ones. We are ill yes, but others have died. We never would have gone therewe had seen this news before hand. The US embassy in the Dominican Republic called in the FBI to carry out toxicology reports which could take up to  days to be completed.    It said in a statement last week: “These incidents are tragic and we offer our deepest condolences to those personally impacted. “Dominican authorities have asked for FBI assistance for further toxicology analysis on the recent Bahia Principe, La Romana, cases and our FBI colleagues tell us that those results may take up to  days.  “We ask everyone to be patient while these investigations run their course.” Francisco Garcia, the country’s tourism minister, called the deaths “isolated incidents” earlier this month and said that the Dominican Republic was a “safe destination”. In a statement on June  Grupo Pinero, which owns the Bahia Principe, called news reports inaccurate and .They added: Bahia Principe Hotels  Resorts would like to express our deep respect to the authorities and the ongoing investigations.

The weather should be fairly nice today, with sunny intervals across parts of the UK this morning and consistent sunshine later on in central and north-east England. Things will really pick up for the Summer Solstice tomorrow when much of the country will bask in sunshine, with Wales and south-west England enjoying the best weather. Temperatures will be fairly low, with highs of around C, although it will feel a lot warmer thanks to low winds and little cloud.    Saturday will see the mercury rise slightly as all of Wales and sections of England enjoy a sunny day, although Sunday will be overcast. A netweather.tv spokesman said: Friday is the Summer Solstice and in a timely manner for a change, high pressure will build in from the south during the day, so although there will be some showers at first affecting mostly northern and northwestern parts, many places will be or become dry and fine through the day. Just a few showers may keep going in the far north-west. High pressure still in charge taking us into Saturday, so most places staying dry and fine with decent sunny spells, with any showers confined to the far north, temperatures up a notch on Friday’s – reaching C in the north to C in the south.    Sunday may start dry and fine for many... Eastern areas likely staying dry, bright and warm, with a southeasterly flow lting temperatures as high as  to C in the south. Netweather warned that there could be some heavy rain on Sunday west England. The weather will take a turn for the worse next week, when thunderstorms are expected towith a vengeance. The Met Office predicts potential torrential downpours in central and eastern England early next week. Lightning and heavy rainfall is likely in the middle of the week across the same areas, forecasters say. There could be aof the flooding witnessed across the country in the past week, which saw the Met Office issue an amber aposdanger to leapos weather warning.    June has been a washout this year, with the month looking likely to be one of the wettest on record. The dampest recorded June was in , although it appears this month will smash that record given the extreme rainfall in recent days. Last weekend, parts of Lincolnshire were battered by two monthsapos rain fell in the space of  hours. Dramatic pictures have shown cars being caught in floods and even a cricket club in Worcestershire completely submerged in water.    Thunderstorms ravaged parts of south and south-east England on Tuesday night, with lighting spotted over Brighton. Improved weather is on the horizon though, with next weekend likely to be a scorcher as the summer sunshine makes an appearance. Friday and Saturday will see the mercury shoot up to C in some places, with both days likely to be sunny. The temperature will dip slightly on Sunday, however it should still be a mostly sunny day.

Aoe Bell says she was addicted to alcohol from the very first sip at the age of .And it soon consumed her le and left her spiralling into a deep depression, reports MyLondon .She hit rock bottom three years ago when, struggling to sleep, her brain thought the best thing to do was take all her anti-depressants. She called for an ambulance but by the time it arrived, she had forgotten it was for her and ran away in confused fear.    Aoe was in her third year at university but had to live at home - and it was this insignicant move that caused her mental health to suffer. But, Aoe admits, she had not been okay for the previous eight years either. The -year-old has been left with permanent brain damage, a scarred bladder and memory issues after her years of binge drinking. She said:  I honestly think I was addicted from the first time I had a drink. I would always be the one who got blackout drunk, I was drinking to numb myself and that continued for a couple of years. I was quite shy until I started drinking. I felt that I could never do what normal -year-olds do until I had a drink. I always had something in me where I just wanted to a rebel. I was a terrible, terrible teenager. My friendship group was the same. Alcohol was so easily accessible, it was never an issue getting it. It started to get really out of control at , I was drinking in the day, in the morning. My college was really left wing, drinking was part of that culture. Everybody always knew I was dferent in the way I drank. I was always the liability.    Iaposd always get into fights with my friends, my mum was in despair. I donapost know how I made it through college, but somehow I did. I couldnapost talk or walk or anything. Despite the drinking she still managed to get the grades to go to university in Brighton to study textiles and business. And being at university helped.  She explained: When I went to uni, I had this motivation come over me, I wanted to be there, I wasnapost rebelling anymore. I did drink a lot, but it wasnapost as much, wasnapost as disal. She loved her le in sunny Brighton - loved her degree, her new group of friends, her boyfriend. Aoe said: I’ve been suffering from pretty severe anxiety and depression since I was  but this had all taken a back seat because I was truly happy and content. I was absolutely dreading moving back home and leaving my le behind, I knew it was going to be bad but, in reality, I had no idea. After two years of living independently, I was thrown back into a world that I didn’t want to be in and I found it really hard to adjust.  My boyfriend had also just broken up with me and the combination of these two relatively insignicant events honestly made me lose my mind. This was when Aoe was put on the anti-depressants that nearly killed her. Both my depression and anxiety literally disappeared after around four days and I really was the happiest I had ever been, she said. This was the beginning of my first episode of mania.  It took about three months before things started to get weird. I was behaving ridiculously recklessly and doing things that were very out of character. I completely lost my sense of reality but was clueless to this at the time. People were really worried about me but I was entirely delusional. It all escalated to one night when she couldnapost sleep, and decided the best remedy to this would be to take all her anti-depressents. In a rare moment of clarity she realised what she had done and phoned for an ambulance, but by the time it arrived she had forgotten she had called.    When she went outside to see what was going on she quickly realised they were there for her and ran down the road, convinced she was running for her le. Eventually she was taken to hospital, waking up to find she was attached to a drip and had two police officers watching over her. I was eventually able to get out of bed and speak to the psychiatrist, she said. He was pretty sure that my problems were more extreme than the anxiety and depression that I felt. Her parents were very supportive throughout everything, and insisted that rather than being put on the NHS waiting list for help they would send her to see someone privately - the cost was nothing compared to her le.  After seeing a psychiatrist she was diagnosed as bipolar and suddenly everything made sense. Aoe said:  per cent of bipolar patients suffer with substance abuse because they are misdiagnosed, so they are self medicating. She added: I was in the hospital and I spoke to a psychiatrist who gave me a talking to and told me I was going to dieI carried on the way I was going. At the time I was still manic so I couldnapost understand the extremeness of the situation. Quitting alcohol was hard, and she had to take medication and be monitored as itaposs so dangerous to come off alcohol cold turkey.  It should be recognised as a mental health problem better - people just see it as you have no self control, Aoe said. Itaposs a very, very stereotyped illness, people think of grown men living on the street. I just felt that I couldnapost talk about it with anyone, I didnapost look like an alcoholic so people didnapost take me seriously. Still in rehab as an outpatient, Aoe has to attend Alcoholics Anonymous and a post-detox class three times a week - and she has high praise for everyone she has encountered while ill. She has been sober since May  and is confident sheaposll never touch another drop. Aoe said: I went to rehab and when people asked me about my job I was so embarrassed [about my situation] and I just decided to tell the world. If I told the world my deepest darkest secret I have nothing left to be embarrassed about.From this came the movement  Mental Health Liberation .The group has written a manesto listing the things it thinks are vital to improving mental health awareness and support, from proper education in schools to positive media exposure of the mentally ill.  Aoe added: It [bipolar disorder] is one of those mental health issues that we really donapost know much about. Iaposm passionate about more research being done, but for me and my group itaposs about all mental health. At the moment weaposre just working on growing our following. We are not an activist group but we do think the mental health community is still entitled to more.Weaposve been in talks with City Hall, they contacted me on Twitter . Iaposm also in contact with broadcasters and some celebrities to help raise awareness and end stigma.So how is she doing personally  She said: In the grand scheme of le Iaposm better but I do still experience mania and real highs and lows. However, Iaposm not as concerned anymore. Every day is a struggle and I am by no means under any kind of illusion that my journey will be easy. I have had to accept that I will spend the rest of my le in recovery.

Laura Hood, , wrongly told police the driver had stopped his cab at the side of the road and sexually assaulted her in the back seat whilst he was giving her a lt home at the end of the evening, it was said. Detectives investigated Hoodaposs claims during which they arrested Haroon Yousaf and also the driver of a dferent taxi with a similar number plate. Mr Yousaf, , who was detained in front of colleagues at a cab rank spent a total  hours in custody and had to give intimate samples before he was released without charge and exonerated of any wrongdoing. It was claimed police suspected he had been ly accused when he gave details of a tracking device linked to the black cab which showed the vehicle had been driven straight to Hoodaposs home in Stockport, Greater Manchester without stopping.  There was also no evidence of physical contact between them. The other suspect was also cleared of any wrongdoing and Hood was subsequently charged with faking her account. Details emerged at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, as she denied perverting the course of justice. If it were not for that tracker data Mr Yousaf may have found himself on trial for rape because the defendant made up a story about him, said Geoff Whelan prosecuting. Perhaps only the defendant knows why she would fabricate such an allegation, but make it up she did. A  allegation is a very serious matter. She accepts that she was in Mr Yousafaposs taxi and she accepts that he drove her home. She further accepts that Mr Yousaf did not rape her - but says, somehow that she honestly believed she was raped whilst in that taxi. The incident occurred on January   after Hood, from Stockport had been out with friends at Revolution bar at the Deansgate Locks complex in Manchester city centre. Mr Yousaf had just dropped off a fare when Hood got into his vehicle at .am and asked to be taken home. Mr Whelan added: She appeared to be drunk as she did so and said she just wanted to go home as she had lost her friends and her mobile phone. She said she had £ and asked how much it was going to be. Mr Yousaf gave her an estimate of about £ and she asked to be taken to a bank. Mr Yousaf drove her to a Tesco Express where CCTV footage showed the taxi stopping there at .am with the defendant getting out to use the cash machine.  By .am the taxi was driving off again and Mr Yousaf followed the directions on his satnav and took her straight home and reached the destination. The fare was around £, and the defendant gave him £ and said keep the change and paid the money through the slot in the middle of all black cab taxis. Mr Yousaf then thanked her then turned around and drove back to town. That  minute journey was in all respects entirely unremarkable. But at . when the defendant got home, it seems she was quite noisy and her mother askingshe was ok. The defendant then went upstairs to her mother and stepfatheraposs bedroom where she was sobbing uncontrollably as she came into the room. Her mother asked her what was wrong and she had lost her phone. She was crying, shaking and unable to breathe and then said that she had been raped. Her stepfather phoned the police and the defendant said she had lost her phone in Revolution and had started to panic and asked a taxi driver take her to Stockport. She said that they were going down the road and thought it was strange because he turned left when they live on the right. She said that he stopped and the driver got in the back of the cab, grabbed her and pulled her knickers down. Her mother asked her why she didnapost fight back and the defendant said that she was scared and that she thought that it would get worseshe tried to fight back. She said that he dropped her off at the end of the road and that he wouldnapost drop her off outside the house. The defendant was hysterical as she was speaking to her mother.

However, police in Thailand suspected foul play in the incident, according to  The Nation .The couple are from China but had been on a trip to Thailand. Following an investigation, Wang finally provided a new account and accused her husband, Yu Xiaodong, , of pushing her off the clf because he wanted her fortune of  million baht  to pay off his debts. Pol Colonel Charnchai Innara, commander of the Khong Chiam district police station, said they found the husband suspicious after noticing him standing at a distance from the scene as rescuers helped his we after the fall. An interpreter also overhead Wang saying to her husband at hospital: Why did you do that to me  The woman later told officers that she was unable to tell her story earlier because her husband wouldnapost leave her side while she was receiving treatment, according to the report. He threatened to kill hershe had told police what happened, Wang claimed.    A tourist found her lying wounded on a trail in the park after she had tumbled down the clf. Police arrested Yu at the Sapphasitthiprasong Hospital in Muang district when he visited his we on Monday. The couple, from east Chinaaposs Jiangsu province, were in Thailand doing business and decided to take a trip to the park, famous for its rock formation. Officer Charnchai said all of the coupleaposs assets belonged to Wang and the husband came from a poor family.  He later accumulated a large amount of debt and asked Wang to help him replay it, but she only agreed to pay half.  Police are now seeking a courtaposs approval to extend Yuaposs detention amid further investigations. He has denied attempted murder, according to the report.

I think he got in the Championship Team of the Year when they won the league in  so he’s a top player.“He was good defensively for us and got up and down all day long.“That’s what you’re looking for from a full-back nowadays.”Losing Smith and McDaid, along with last season’s Championship top scorer Lawrence Shankland, goalkeeper Ross Doohan and defender Michael Rose was a blow for the Honest Men.However, Paisley-born Docherty insists with most of their squad from last season signed up, they can make a push for promotion once again.Experienced heads like former Terror Mark Kerr, Steven Bell, Michael Moffat, Andy Geggan, ex-Dundee man Jamie Adams and Craig Moore have agreed new deals since the end of the last campaign and Docherty has warned they should not be counted out of competing at the top of the table again.He added: “The team did so well and maybe over-achieving has cost us a little.“With that you are going to lose a couple of players.“The big-hitters are away but we have a lot of players signed up who know the club and what it’s all about.”A four-season veteran at Somerset Park, Docherty has made  appearances for Ayr.However, in recent times, he has been dogged by injury and has only had  run outs in each of the past two seasons.He believes he has put those fitness woes behind him and aims to get himself back in the engine-room of a successful team.Docherty added: “Last season I was coming back from injury and once the season started it was hard to get in.“We were doing so well and I was happy to play a role but it was a bit frustrating.“Hopefully, I can be a lot more involved in a good season this time out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"caley legend tokely thinks dundee and united could struggle with promotion pressure","story":"Inverness Caley Thistle legend Ross Tokely believes his old club can capitalise on huge pressures weighing on the Tayside clubs in next season’s Championship.Tokely, who made a club record  appearances across four isions in  years with the Caley Jags, is convinced John Robertson’s team can mount a renewed title challenge next season.And he is convinced relegated Dundee and play-off failures Dundee United will face a burden of expectation up against less-fancied rivals like Inverness.Tokely said: “It will be another interesting league with two Dundee sides in there next season.“United will be spending the money again, as will Dundee, but Caley Thistle just need to do what they do best and not worry about anyone .“They just need to build momentum and wins – and leave the pressure to Dundee and Dundee United.

league win at FC Lahti.It was ideal timing that RoPS should be in league action just hours after the draw and McInnes made the most of it to get an early lowdown on the Finns.Aberdeen face RoPS in the first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday July  before thethe following week at Rovaniemi, just four miles south of the Arctic Circle.At stake is a clash with CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg or FC Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia in the second qualying round.RoPS were unseeded in the draw and are a lowly th in the UEFA club coefficient rankings, below teams from Gibraltar.However, McInnes – who will also have their games in Finland before the tie scouted – will take nothing for granted.He said: “We watched a stream of their game on Tuesday afternoon and there will be other opportunities to see RoPS in action.“We will get more games online and will get over to Finland to see them as well.“I think we will be able to see them three or four times before we face them in the first leg.“That is one of the benefits from facing a team who are midway through their season, although I would always want to play someone who is at the same stage as us.“We are well on the way to getting a good handle on RoPS.”RoPS Rovaniemi qualied for Europe by finishing second in the Veikkausliiga last season behind title winners HJK Helsinki.They have failed to recreate that form this season as RoPS are currently third bottom of the top flight with just  points from the opening  league games.Although RoPS won on Tuesday, the Dons will take heart from their opponents’ form at home on the articial surface at Keskuskentta stadium, where they are now six games without victory.McInnes said: “They finished second in their league last season and on the back of that their manager got a move to HJK Helsinki.“They have a new managerand we believe they have had a few injuries lately. The Finnish league is a decent standard so to finish second is a good achievement.”RoPS may be struggling in their league but McInnes is wary that they have that match sharpness that only comes from sustained competitive action.He will use the next three weeks of pre-season training and friendlies to ensure his squad are not “under-cooked” for the tie.McInnes said: “The biggest trepidation is going into the game under-cooked compared to the team you are playing.“From that side they have an advantage because we always need to get our legs going.“We will try to deal with that.“There is no doubt it will be a tough game. But we have handled that in the past and we have the experience now.“It is important we try to utilise the time we have between now and that first game.”There are a few familiar faces in the RoPS squad as defender Mahamadou Sissoko was at Kilmarnock from  to ’.Keeper Antonio Reguero was at Inverness Caley Thistle during the - campaign and Ross County in - and also spent a spell at Hibs.Former Marseille, AC Milan, Dynamo Kiev and QPR left-back Taye Taiwo, capped  times by Nigeria, also stars for the Finns.McInnes said: “They have a couple of players who have played in Scotland before so they will know what to expect coming to Aberdeen.“There is that added excitement now of the Europa League and we will try to come through the pre-season and the friendly matches without injury complaints.“Hopefully we can have a full squad ready to set about the task of getting the club into the next round.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.37958182-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.37958182-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.37958182-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.37958182-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen airport workers set to take part in more strike action later this month","story":"Workers at Aberdeen International Airport will go on strike again later this month.Members of the Unite union will walk out on June  and , between am and am, as the dispute with the airport’s owners AGS, over pay and the closing of their defined benefit pension scheme continues.Union chiefs say airport bosses had offered a “repackaged % pay offer” which it claims is materially the same as one tabled in April.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article16536632.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/4_shr_ayp_260216nick.jpg","title":"bulldozers flatten buildings ayrshire main 16536673#comments","story":"NewsBulldozers about to flatten buildings in Ayrshire Main StreetShareBySarah Hilley:,  JUN NewsPrestwick Main Street, general view \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn old police station and social work office are set to be demolished next month.

Consultation would take place with residents once plans are developed. The council bought the old station from Police Scotland to make room for the affordable development.

brother having all come in at the toll with the burgh Flag before me.ldquoThe whole day has been amazing ndash beyond anything I could ever have hoped for ndash but seeing my Gran waiting for me was something .Weather warnings and heavy rain in the day or two leading up to Selkirk Common Riding had caused a bit of concern for many officials.But come Friday morning the rain-clouds had parted and the sun began to tip those welcoming hills with gold.Selkirkrsquos fabulous three bands ndash Flute, Silver and Pipe ndash set the tone for Souters frae arsquo the airts.Before the celebrations could begin, the solemn reminder of sacrice was respected at the War Memorial ahead of the Exiles and locals mustered outside the County Hotel.And as the numbers swelled even further, high above the growing gathering Craig Monks was Installed as Royal Burgh Standard Bearer on the balcony of the Victoria Halls.Having been brought up in a household proudly lsquoobsessedrsquo with the Common Riding, Craig had been waiting for this moment since childhood.And with a confident smile he relished his time in the saddle, at the head of a -strong cavalcade.Through the streaming Ettrick, up the Linglie to

precision and perfect timing.To the tune that every Selkirk child has grown up with, Up Wirsquo the Souters, each of his fellow Standard Bearers, representing the townrsquos ancient incorporations,

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes.

But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times. He is a performance artist, really, a living commentary on the state of society. A politician of shting principle, who is not expected to honour his promises, and whose moral compass is his own ambition. So, prepare for a bumpy ride. The one thing Boris Johnson will never be is boring."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  March on the Tories  not the BBC  over free TV licences","story":"Older folk on this side of the Atlantic are indeed preparing to change out of their slippers, albeit for a very dferent cause.

Rather, it is a calculated move as part of a much bigger, more ideological and potentially damaging attack on our public institutions.How George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who made the decision to cut funding for free TV licences, must have laughed over the last week as he put out article after article about the brouhaha in the newspaper he now edits, the London Evening Standard.The joke, of course, is on us. Mr Osborne and his chum David Cameron were two of the most blatantly mendacious politicians of the modern era. It is they who sowed the seeds of the dangerous political situation we currently find ourselves in, who set the standard for the motley crew of charlatans and nersquoer-do-wells lining up to lead the country further into oblivion.Letrsquos do a quick recap. Despite casting themselves in  as modern, centrist one-nation Conservatives, the Cameron administrationrsquos post-crash austerity narrative disguised a strategy specically designed to run-down, undermine and under-fund our public institutions and services. Indeed, this agenda, taken alongside the EU referendum, suggest Cameron and Osborne were doing the work of the Tory hard right from the off. We should have remembered from the s that the Tories are past masters when it comes to ide and rule. And yet here we are in , iding ourselves into ldquothem and ldquous politically, constitutionally, culturally, economically, on the precipice of a disastrous no-deal Brexit under an odiously populist leader. The services and institutions that used to anchor us on common ground, the post-war settlement that encompassed social housing, the NHS, the BBC, have or are in the process of being deliberately, ideologically undermined.And by attacking the BBC over free licences, we are doing the work of these ideologues.Though I do not agree with the view that all over-s should get a free TV licence, I respect the NPCrsquos demand to retain the benefit. The plan to march on the BBC, however, is not only wrong-headed but plays straight into the hands of those who would like to see our remaining public services either privatised or obliterated.More likely to vote than other groups and with higher incomes, older people now have more clout than ever before they should use it by putting on their marching shoes and heading to Conservative HQ."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Who won the Tory manspreading contest ","story":"Not THE Boris Johnson, blonder than Harlow, more reclusive than Garbo, the dude the media cannot tame  The very same.

Plockton High School is bringing a Clean Air Day theme to classes, with pupils discussing and debating air quality and what can be done to improve it.In Crieff, Perthshire, where the pollution- generating A road runs directly through the town, a local primary school is taking part in an air quality workshop.Other engagement events include an initiative to encourage active travel organised by Falkirk Active Travel Hub at Forth Valley Royal Hospital and free breakfast vouchers for NHS staff who cycle or walk to work at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock.Some leading figures in the environmental sector are, however, ambivalent about how much of an impact Clean Air Day will actually have. ldquoItrsquos going to be quite limited, says Gavin Thomson, Air Pollution Campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland.ldquoI think itrsquos a good idea and Itrsquos a good opportunity to take stock and look at what is being done on air quality, but to achieve big improvements as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we need to start seeing bolder action from both our councils and the Scottish Government.Thomson backs the commitment to the low emission zones in Scotlandrsquos main cities, pointing out it is something Friends of the Earth has been arguing for over years.ldquoIn reality, though, itrsquos not yet clear whether theyrsquore going to be as ambitious as they could be.ldquoWe have an incongruity between the rhetoric, which is pretty promising, and the policies we are seeing at a local level.

Thatrsquos a laudable objective. But the strategy to achieve this is dafter than any character Jerry Lewis or Norman Wisdom created.Comedy writing has never been about defending the patriarchy. More often than not itrsquos been about two blokes sitting in a flat throwing ideas back and forward while eating caramel wafers and sooking strong tea. This double male world usually features one typing while the other lays on a couch scratching his bits and trying to come up with a killer line to end the first scene, all in time for Countdown starting.This female-free writing form has resulted in the likes of Steptoe and Son, The Likely Lads, Porridge, Dadrsquos Army, Are You being Served It Ainrsquot Half Hot Mum, and Hi-de-Hi, all classic sitcoms written by the likes of Galton and Simpson, Clement and La Frenais and Croft and Perry.Andthis new mixed writing team rule were to apply to the BBCthis would mean our own comedy duos such as Still Gamersquos Kiernan and Hemphill and Burnistounrsquos Florence and Connell would be wasting the caramel wafer money. Two Doors Downrsquos creators Carlyle and Sharp would have had to squeeze an extra chair into Carlylersquos parentsrsquo garden shedand hope the added voice didnrsquot obscure their own.Saskia Schusterrsquos bosses should point out her virtue signalling is not only wrong, itrsquos stupid, isive and ill-thought out.They should underline the idea that writing success generally emerges from a connection of minds, two people on the same page, literally and figuratively, two people in love with the same idea, of how to create a character, a plot line, a set-up, gag. To impose an addition to the process ndash regardless of sex ndash is to deny the alchemy already apparent.What Schuster is doing in demanding female representation in every comedy script submission is to create arranged marriages. But the chances of such marriages producing offspring that will become loved by a nation are slim.There is no doubt that some of our television writing in the past has had a smear of sexism. You could argue the Pythons team could have done with the addition of a female writer to reduce the bikinis on display. But itrsquos also important to remember women have never been banned from writing for television think Carla Lane, Jenner Saunders, Victoria Wood. Itrsquos even more important to point out the most successful comedy writers right now are female: Fleabagrsquos Phoebe Waller-Bridge has Killing Eve and the upcoming Bond movie to her credits, Derry Girlsrsquo creator Lisa McGhee is on her third network series. Male-female writing teams already work,allowed to emerge naturally, as was the case with John Cleese and Connie Boothrsquos Fawlty Towers, and is the case with Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaneyrsquos very funny C Catastrophe.Yes, we would all love gender balance in TV writing. Last year, women wrote % of TV episodes. But the way to bring about balance is not to squeeze a female into the garden shed. The way forward is for television to invest in more writer workshops, encourage the likes of female writing collectives such as Glasgowrsquos based Witsherface,which features the likes of Karen Dunbar.The way forward is for teachers to show episodes of Derry Girls to th year pupils and say ldquoPay attention, girls. You too can have a career in TV writingyou can come up with something as funny as this.So letrsquos have a re-think, ITV. And bear this in mind the sweet BBC sitcom success Mum was written by a man. Which tells you that being funny isnrsquot gender related. We can write for each other, that comedy isnrsquot sex prescriptive.Look at your real failings, ITV. The likes of Love Islandrsquos new series which already faces accusation of racism, gaslighting and now sexual harassment by a female on a male,Itrsquos a show pumped full of Viagra in the form of a beautul villa, alcohol and cash, in the hope those taking part will take each other apart and at the end of the night behave like farmyard animals.The response to discrimination is not to discriminate against men.

The majority of the aforesaid members are over  years of age and appear to care little for the unprecedented economic, social and political vandalism that those who come after them will be bequeathed. Attitudes are hardening across the country and those who desire real social democracy will not, I fear, find it in any future Conservative Government. English nationalism, fuelled by Brexit as well as an international fillip for those on the far right, must now wag the Tory party dog for the immediate political future.Ruth Davidsons anti-independence mantra now looks hollow and isolated and Scottish Conservatives must undergo an existential self-analysis. Many Scottish voters are now disillusioned and feel impotent in the face of a future Boris Johnson premiership and its implications of American hegemony.Independence has never looked so irresistible. The only question is:not now, then when Owen Kelly, Stirling.IAIN Macwhirter paints a rather bleak view of Scotlandrsquos future in the UK and appears to use that to justy resorting to an independence referendum or some other means that is not founded on a legally binding agreement with the UK Government .It is surprising to read a serious commentator talk of \"extra-legal means of securing Scottish independence\". Surely the SNP leadership can wait until the fog of Brexit clears, to seethe public mood in Scotland is genuinely behind revisiting the issue of our membership of the UK. To push on when the majority opinion is against holding a vote any time soon appears to be unnecessarily provocative and likely to be self-defeating in terms of how people will vote.I do not favour breaking up the UK, but equally I accept that majority opinion in Scotland must ultimately be respected. Yet of course, it was not so very long ago that we all put a great deal of focus on the issue of independence and gave a clear answer. Meanwhile circumstances have changed but is seems that the weight of opinion on this matter has not. For all our sakes, I hope that cooler heads in the Scottish Government manage to steer away from inflicting further and unnecessary discord on us when we are neither ready for it or wanting to compound the constitutional uncertainty of recent years.Keith Howell, West Linton.SOME of your columnists are working themselves into a frenzy over a rush to independence. But before we compound the disaster of Brexit by doubling down on the uncertainty likely to be caused by another referendum, let us reflect.I wrote to you a couple of weeks ago about the mediocrity of the current crop of politicians in Scotland and across the UK. In the interim, things havenrsquot suddenly, dramatically improved.The track record of the Scottish Government in dealing with newly devolved powers is mediocre: infrastructure issues, under-estimates of staff required to administer devolved powers and budgetary black holes. Do we really believe theyrsquoll be any better when they are required to implement and administer the powers and services that independence will confer upon them Two wrongs do not make a right. To suggest a rush to independence, at a time when the whole of the UK is in a period of uncertainty, is plain wrong. It is wrong firstly, because the Scottish Government is not prepared for a complete break from the rest of the UK. But secondly, and more importantly, the majority of the populace still do not want to split.Supporters of independence are loud, vocal and visible. The silent majority see no need to publicly counter these ostentatious displays of faux-Scottishness. They will turn out again at the ballot box, to vote down a break from the Union, regardless of whether Boris Johnson becomes PM or of whether or not Brexit is delivered.JS Brennan, Glasgow G.If the SNP Finance Secretary, Derek Mackay, is listening, then why not reduce Scottish income tax levels and Land  Buildings Transaction Tax levels too and see that the lower the taxes, the higher the tax income received due to greater activity and productivity  The SNP might not be happy to admit this but the Tory tax policy of allowing people to keep more of what they earn is not a crime and the \"attainment gap\" would close naturally rather than articially. Alternatively we can just wait until  and the next Holyrood elections. What goes up, must come down .Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IF the people of Scotland wish to remain part of the UK and an integral part of Europe the population needs to vote Labour. I suggest that to make this palatable to voters currently aligned to other parties, the Labour Party and the trade union movement have an urgent requirement to replace an inept Jeremy Corbyn. People have little confidence in Mr Corbyn ndash perceived as another Michael Foot. Hopefully the same will be true of the Tory Party faithful and this will eventually thwart Boris Johnson. My own preference for Labour leader would be Emily Thornberry, and Rory Stewart for the Tories .Robert Gemmell, Port

Japan ldquoproposed a workable framework on marine plastic waste that involves emerging and less developed countries. Under the framework, G members will promote a comprehensive le-cycle approach to prevent and reduce plastic litter discharge to the oceans through ious measures and international cooperation.The countryrsquos industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, said that Japan would aim to make businesses charge for disposable shopping bags by as early as April to help reduce waste. The framework is likely to be one of the less contentious environmental issues raised at the summit, following President Trumprsquos decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement at the  summit causing the rest of the members to issue a statement saying that they considered the climate accord ldquoirreversible.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also said earlier this week that his government wants to promote Japanrsquos proposals on measures against space debris at international venues such as G meetings.The proposals, by the Liberal Democratic Partyrsquos special committee on space and ocean development, call for the implementation of technical demonstrations to deal with the issue of space debris and the establishment of international rules.New blockchain collaboration aims to reduce carbon footprintInthe week that Facebook announced plans to introduce Libra, a cryptocurrency, energy teams and network operators have collaborated in a blockchain project that is likely to be less controversial and aims to improve the decarbonisation and operating costs of the UK energy system.Electron, National Grid Electricity System Operator, SP Energy Networks and UK Power Networks will work together create a shared register called the RecorDER project powered by blockchain for energy generation and storage data and aimed at creating a comprehensive and datadriven view of assets that are connected to energy networks.The improved visibility and availability of asset data will be used to inform decisions related to reducing operating costs and accelerating decarbonisation through the integration of renewables and the use of energy storage assets.ldquoThis is a great example of networks collaborating to deliver benefits to their customers.

Fty ships went to the seabed.In later years, many were later brought to the surface again during one of the most remarkable salvage operations ever attempted.Those that remain – seven vessels in all # attract ers from worldwide and make Scapa Flow the premier wreck ing site in Europe.The programme begins on Saturday, June , and involves talks by experts, performances by the German Navy and Royal Navy musicians, underwater imagery, a theatre piece, the screening of a  documentary on the scuttling – and the chance to explore the seabed wrecks using the latest virtual reality technology.Descendant of those involved in the events are set to come to Orkney, and a special service of commemoration will take place over one of the wrecks and at the Lyness Naval Cemetery.Full details are available on the Orkney Islands Council website: www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S scapa--events-programme.htm and on the Scapa  Facebook page www.facebook scapa copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under. Tourism NI last week marked the last official stop of a -mile community engagement campaign ‘The Epic Journey to The th Open’, and with just a month to go, Open fever is starting to take a grip of the nation as the spotlight falls on Portrush. Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do.

The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"expert panel appointed to advise uk government on alternative arrangements for irish border after brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Workers will now have to examine their own pay packets to see have they received any payment for time worked over and above their normal working hours.If not, they should take urgent legal advice as time limits are important, as generally claims need to be lodged within three months of the last payment which was received for holiday pay which did not account for any overtime worked.Employers in both the public and the private sector will have to re-examine their method of payments and, as directed by the Court of Appeal, where appropriate include a payment for overtime in holiday pay.As it has now been defined by the Court of Appeal that workers must be rewarded and recognised for the time worked over and above their contracted hours, the majority of employers, both in the public and private sectors, will now be facing some form of a bill for unpaid overtime.How much will depend on inidual circumstances.Julie Leonard is an employment partner at Edwards  Co Solicitors, Belfast"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts railway line closed after security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"us house of representatives votes to double funding for international fund for ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"irish language to be taught through pe classes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"st myllins day celebrations in llanfyllin","story":"Sculpture made by members of Masquerade for the parade\" Llanfyllin celebrates St Myllins dayMasquerade drama group during their performance\" Llanfyllin celebrates St Myllins dayNSPCC Llanfylllin and Bwlch-y-cibau branch volunteers, Colleen Williams, Pat Evaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtns and Pam Morrislt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"jeremys marathon effort raises","story":"Jeremy Lewis from Llanfair Caereinion ran the Edinburugh marathon on Sundayto raise as mltspan classtruncate-full-screengtuch money as possible for Teenage Cancer Trust! \" Jeremy#s marathon effort raises £,Jezza runs Jeremy Lewis and his son, Will.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"global wellness day 2019 celebrated at","story":"Children from the First Steps Nursery joined in the celebrations and walks at Llltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtandrindod Wells Lakeltspan classtruncate-full-screengtside after the renaming ceremony.Picture: Ernie Hussonlt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Pictures: From the day Llandrindod Wells changed its name to promote healthy livingThe launch of Llandrindod Wellness day at the Hotel pole.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

Care also needs to be taken in speculating on what may be the wider impact in Northern Ireland.“I have engaged with the Head of the Civil Service, and the Departments of Finance and Economy on this ruling. I understand that the Civil Service will be assessing all aspects of this situation, including what becomes the final legal position, respect for the entitlements of workers, and how to achieve budgetary cover.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

any plans to close local offices.The NIHE admitted it is looking at the way customers access services. A spokesperson said: “We can confirm that in south region specically, we are looking at a number of options which include phased relocation and reduced hours given there are five offices within a short geographical distance of each other. But no decision has yet been taken.”Mr O’Dowd said: “I have been made aware that the Housing Executive is intending to a close a number of district housing offices including, Banbridge, Lurgan, and Portadown offices. Staff are being transferred to Marlborough House in Craigavon and other regional offices.“I am very concerned about the implications of this news for Executive tenants. They are losing a much valued local service and contact with Executive staff.“I am calling on the Housing Executive to carry out a full Equality Impact assessment and rural needs assessment before any final decisions are made about the future of the local offices.“The Housing Executive are a vital part of community infrastructure and should not be disappearing from local areas.“I have written to the Chief Executive of the Housing body to express concern and to request an urgent update on the future of local district offices.” A Housing Executive spokesperson said: “The Housing Executive is currently looking at how to best deliver its service and we are committed to maintaining services in local areas in line with customer demand.“Any proposals would be subject to a formal process to include consultation with union, staff, customers, the local community and political representatives. It will also assess the impact on equality and rural areas.“We would like to reassure customers that any decision taken by the Housing Executive will not affect the high quality service we deliver to them. We have also reassured our staff that there will not be job losses as a result of any changes to how we deliver services locally.”The spokesperson added: “The way in which our customers access services is rapidly changing. “We have seen a % reduction in footfall into our offices in the last four years, and a marked increase in telephone and online contact and we expect this trend to accelerate in the future.

develop our online services for our tenants within the next year and have already extended our phone service operating hours. “We have also changed the way in which we deliver services to our tenants and those who are seeking social housing by increasing the number of front line officer and having them call directly to customers’ homes rather than them having to visit our offices. “We are, of course, mindful that our customers are requiring our assistance now more than ever, and that is why we offer services online, on the phone and face to face across Northern Ireland. “We want to be able to respond to the needs of our customers and provide the services they require, while at the same time ensuring value for money and effective use of our offices.“Currently, we have offices in buildings which we either own or which we rent from private or public sector landlords. “We would prefer to spend money on services than unnecessarily on buildings. “If we have any proposals to alter

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”NIHE offices may close and move

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
