Rugby fans anticipating Saturday\u0027s final would disagree. It has meant a deep friendship, forged as precociously talented under-11s playing rugby league (the code of the game with 13, rather than 15, players) in the clubs of northern England.It followed them south when their dads joined Saracens rugby union club, and continued when the young pals went on to play professional rugby and be capped for their country (both were set to be named in the World Cup final squad when the line-up was announced this morning).         Schoolboy friends who bonded over their passion for sport and who will join the England line-up in Yokohama for the Rugby World Cup final on SaturdayThe friendship also spawned a nagging rivalry as they competed to play in the coveted fly-half position. To this day, it continues, with the England coach Eddie Jones swapping them in and out of that role depending on the tactics and the opposition — to the team\u0027s benefit.Even more astonishing, is the fact that both boys went to a school which has produced four of England\u0027s players.As well as Farrell and Ford, the state comprehensive St George\u0027s School in Harpenden can also boast Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton among its former pupils.Farrell and Ford joined the school as members of rugby league royalty: Farrell\u0027s father Andy originally played for Wigan but switched codes and joined Saracens in 2005, shortly after George\u0027s father Mike — another rugby league original — was named the club\u0027s coach. Itoje was one of the few boys who boarded at the state school, while Singleton came from a strong sporting family.It\u0027s an incredible return for a state comprehensive, albeit one with a proud rugby history.When classes resume next week after half-term, the current crop of hopefuls will build up their strength in the Owen Farrell Fitness Suite, dreaming that their picture will join the school\u0027s wall of fame.As a young boy, Farrell was known for his steely resolve. Aged 12 and playing for St Patricks rugby league club in Wigan, Farrell sported a mop of long, blond hair, kept out of his eyes by a hairband.\u0027He took pride in his hair,\u0027 a team-mate from those days recently recalled. \u0027I remember the opposition trying to wind him up one day and, every time they could, they\u0027d pull his hairband over his face.\u0027Eventually Owen lost his cool and it all kicked off. By the time any of us got there he\u0027d laid four of them out. He wasn\u0027t someone to mess with.\u0027         Former England rugby union defensive coach Mike Ford with his sonsA decade and a half on and that haircut is shorter and sharper — but the steely inner core remains.Last Saturday, as the New Zealand opposition performed the Haka, the fearsome Maori \u0027war dance\u0027 with which they begin each match, Farrell wasn\u0027t going to be intimidated. Instead, watching with his team-mates, the faintest trace of a smile — a smirk, even — flickered across the England captain\u0027s normally expressionless face.Given the reputation of the All Blacks, such provocation could easily have backfired. But within two minutes of the start of the semi-final, England had taken the lead. They never looked back, winning the game and booking a place in Saturday\u0027s final.That\u0027s not to say that Farrell, 28, came out of the encounter entirely unscathed, suffering a dead leg that hampered him for much of the match.While it meant that he had to hand over the kicking duties, it was fitting that George Ford — England\u0027s fly-half on the day — was on hand to take on the task. Of course, during the match, nobody dared to suggest to Farrell that he might consider leaving the field of play because of his injury.\u0027I think you would have needed a samurai sword to get him off,\u0027 Eddie Jones observed afterwards.But then, that\u0027s Farrell for you. Not only one of the most gifted rugby union players in the world — but one of the toughest, too. Given his heritage, that\u0027s hardly surprising. His mother, Colleen O\u0027Loughlin, and father, Andy, teenage sweethearts, were just 16 when he was born in Wigan. They didn\u0027t have a home of their own, each instead giving their parents\u0027 addresses on their son\u0027s birth certificate.         Almost from the word go, Owen was by his dad\u0027s side, living and breathing every aspect of a game that ran in his bloodOn the same document, his dad recorded his occupation as \u0027apprentice joiner\u0027.It wasn\u0027t a profession he would pursue for long.Because by then Farrell Senior was already making his name with Wigan Warriors. By the age of 18 he was playing international rugby, going on to captain Great Britain.Almost from the word go, Owen was by his dad\u0027s side, living and breathing every aspect of a game that ran in his blood. Having had him so young, say friends, the bond between the pair was more like that of best buddies than parent and son. During school holidays, the youngster would watch his father train, helping collect the balls afterwards — \u0027Big Faz\u0027 and \u0027Little Faz\u0027 as they were known.\u0027There were always rugby balls in the house,\u0027 Farrell recalled. \u0027Pretty much everyone in my family used to play. My dad taught me how to kick. That\u0027s what you want to do as a kid — kick a ball.\u0027By the age of 12, Farrell was streets ahead of his peers: \u0027From early on, you could tell he was a bit different,\u0027 recalls Martin McLaughlin, one of his coaches at St Patricks.Even at that age word began to spread that Farrell looked set to follow his father to the top of the game. And by \u0027game\u0027 he meant rugby league, not rugby union.But that all changed in 2005 when his father moved south to switch codes and pursue a career with Saracens — a top rugby union club. The family moved to a £1 million home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire — much to the fury of the young Farrell. His dad recalled his boy \u0027kicking and screaming\u0027 about the move, which took him away from his beloved rugby league.Initially, the plan was for him to go back up north at the weekends by train so he could carry on with his old team, staying with his grandparents.But it wasn\u0027t long before he got a taste for rugby union, being \u0027dragged down\u0027 to Harpenden RFC where his talents were there to see.Sports teacher Steve Robbins recalls the young Farrell\u0027s arrival.\u0027He turned up on his first day and everyone stared at him thinking: \u0027Blimey, you look about two years older than us,\u0027 \u0027 says Mr Robbins.\u0027He was quite quiet because it was a different environment for him — a church school down south with smart blazers. He looked uncomfortable but it didn\u0027t take him long to undo his top button.\u0027Farrell\u0027s primary interest was sport rather than study, and George was happy to help out with the homework: \u0027George was a bit more organised than me,\u0027 Farrell himself has admitted. By their mid-teens, Farrell was on the books at Saracens, while Ford was making a name for himself for Leicester Tigers, and both made their way up the England age-group teams.For his Saracens debut, in a pre-season friendly, Farrell was on the bench alongside his father. Early in the second half, Andy went on first and suffered a broken thumb, to be replaced by his son. As one Farrell exited the stage, another entered.Since retiring from playing the game Farrell Senior has become a successful coach. He and his son have worked alongside one another, first at Saracens and then at England. And, more recently, they have lined up for opposing sides — Andy recently started as head coach of Ireland.Despite his star status and chiselled good looks, Farrell\u0027s fame has never gone to his head. In a recent interview, he said that he does not see himself as a \u0027celebrity\u0027 and would never consider going down the Strictly Come Dancing route.Last year, he married his girlfriend Georgie Lyon and in March they had a son, Tommy. Georgie keeps herself very private: apart from one appearance on his Instagram account during a holiday in July 2016, she has never been pictured alongside Owen publicly on social media, and very little is known about her or their relationship.The bond between father and son was evident at Owen\u0027s wedding evening reception when the pair sang Oasis\u0027s Some Might Say together.On the day Owen\u0027s son was born, Saracens were playing Glasgow in the Champions Cup. Kick-off was at 3.15pm. At 2.30pm, Farrell rang his club saying that the birth was imminent and he thought that he still might be able to play.Unsurprisingly, in the end he didn\u0027t make the game — but it\u0027s a mark of his dedication to the sport that he even thought it possible.Another mark of the man is the work he has done for charity. For the past few years, whenever Farrell scores on the rugby field he celebrates by locking his two forefingers together, his arms held out in front of him.The trademark gesture forms the letters \u0027JJ\u0027 — the initials of 11-year-old Jack Johnson, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease.Jack is the terminally ill son of Andy Johnson, a former team-mate of Farrell\u0027s father at Wigan.As well as helping raise the profile of the disease and the Joining Jack charity, he also helps out at events as well as spending time with Jack.A sure sign that, even if come Saturday he and England find themselves on top of the world, Owen Farrell will never forget his roots. "},{"url":null,"title":"Nick Ross reveals landmark report Grenfell not uncovered truth","story":"Share this article Yet so far the inquiry hasn\u0027t even covered half of that. It took a long chain of bad decisions and worn-out policy to allow a fridge fault in a fourth-floor flat to turn into the biggest single loss of life in London since the Blitz.Not many of those involved will come out unscathed, and firefighters are not alone in thinking it ironic that the first people to be humbled in the report are those who came to the rescue.Little wonder Matt Wrack, boss of the Fire Brigade Union tweeted angrily: \u0027Firefighters did not put flammable cladding on Grenfell Tower. Firefighters risked their own lives time and again during the fire.\u0027 To which he added: \u0027Government has done nothing substantive in 28 months.\u0027All this is true, and not just this government. Successive governments and their fire ministers have been shamefully complacent. I will come back to that disgraceful issue in a moment.And not only is it true that firefighters risk their lives, as Mr Wrack says, but they work in frighteningly hostile conditions.To see what they go through, often fumbling on hands and knees in blazing heat and almost zero visibility, is shocking to those unaware of how dangerous, uncomfortable and distressing many rescue operations are.         The families (pictured) of some of the Grenfell victims held a press conference at Church House, Deans Yard, London, after part of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry was publishedAnd spare a thought for the control room staff and the harrowing life-and-death calls they had to manage.But justified public admiration for firefighters has protected them from the need for a different sort of boldness. If only they had been as plucky with their political masters as they are in rescue operations. How did they allow the building regulations to become so out of date?How did they accept without loud and persistent protest a system of building control that tempted designers and contractors to cut corners?And a big bugbear for me, why had they not mounted a rumbustious and powerful campaign to demand that sprinklers be fitted to all new and refurbished housing, as is compulsory in Wales? Sprinklers are cheap. People don\u0027t die in homes with sprinklers. There\u0027s often little damage. Usually the fire is controlled by sprinklers alone.It must be said that there were many fine fire chiefs — I was recruited by them to the cause of fire safety and I campaigned alongside them — who stuck their necks out to push for more protection in social housing. But the National Fire Chiefs Council, like London\u0027s fire chief Dany Cotton, only came out with full-throated support after so many died in this gut-wrenching disaster.The appointment of fire chiefs has long been politicised, favouring people who conform rather than independent thinkers and if anything the introduction of elected commissioners has pushed them to be more compliant.          Following the blaze, London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton (pictured) defended the advice given out to residents to stay-putIt is important to be process-driven in any complex, high-risk emergency but it needs audacious leadership to know when to discard the manual.Unquestionably, the failure to evacuate for an hour before they did was catastrophic.But the stay-put policy was designed to protect residents in fire-resistant concrete compartments and to stop people dying in high-rise stairwells. It had largely served its purpose over decades, and, though Dany Cotton has been castigated, would you have done any different?In the intensity of the moment it always seems riskier to break the rules than follow an ingrained procedure, and stay-put was a nationwide policy. In fact, according to the report, her commanders had \u0027no training for how to recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one\u0027.What is more surprising is that even with hindsight Dany Cotton has said she\u0027d do the same again. I fear that speaks volumes not just about her but about the sort of people promoted into fire service leadership.The report is right that the fire service was stuck in its ways. Years before Grenfell it was obvious that some forms of cladding posed a fire risk.All around the world there had been instances, some of them dramatic and widely publicised on social media, where flames had shot up the outside of structures, not least in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, the aptly named Torch Tower in Dubai.It should have been fire chiefs hammering on the doors of regulators to make sure flammable cladding was categorically banned. At the very least risks should have been identified and procedures thoroughly revised.Sir Martin thinks there is \u0027compelling evidence\u0027 that building regulations were breached, and will look at those next year. But I can tell you now that the regulations had not been revised for years, were poorly policed, and there was so much wriggle room that it might take months of argument in court to establish what was legal and what was not.Yet still, I feel sorry for Dany Cotton and her team. As Sir Martin concedes: \u0027They showed great courage and dedication.\u0027What he should have added, but so far hasn\u0027t, is that we need urgent solutions, not scapegoats. Sadly that does not seem to be what everybody wants to focus on. Blame is in the air. Most of it wide of the mark, and none of it likely to prevent similar tragedies.Some has been rancorous and frankly tribal.Even allowing for high emotions, Labour\u0027s John McDonnell must surely now be embarrassed at making political capital out of the disaster soon after the fire, with his outburst that the victims were \u0027murdered\u0027 by political decisions made by Tories.In fact, as I can attest after spending decades pressing for better fire safeguards in social housing, seven of the nine government ministers we met and who turned down our pleas were Labour.Then there are the activists who have been flyposting Marxist slogans across London: \u0027Justice for Grenfell, Austerity Kills\u0027. In fact the fire took hold because the cladding was part of an improvement package costing £8.6million — a package which the report concedes, \u0027was intended to promote safety in the event of fire\u0027.The refurbishment was agreed, as was the cladding, by a tenant management organisation whose board had a majority of tenants, and was signed off by the council\u0027s housing scrutiny committee which included a councillor who is now the constituency\u0027s Labour MP.And in a similar vein, a firefighter who attended Grenfell blamed cuts to the London Fire Brigade.Taking a headline from the Moore-Bick inquiry beside a photo of Boris Johnson, he tweeted: \u0027I am truly disgusted by what this country has become. This picture sums it up perfectly. Man who closed 10 fire stations, cut 30 fire engines and 500 firefighters not to blame. But Fire Brigade cut to ribbons, fully to blame.\u0027It is nonsense of course. Fire stations were being closed because over the past few decades fire-related deaths had plummeted, down some 40 per cent in the decade leading up to Grenfell.Firefighters have done much to help the trend, offering safety advice and smoke detectors. But it had meant there was now less call for the service.Another 10 fire stations, 30 pumps and 500 firefighters would not have made much difference to those trapped in Grenfell Tower. It is true some specialist equipment might have been useful but that is a different issue.It is equally nonsense that the local council is to blame. At least 430 other residential towers in England had risky cladding, many if not most, in Labour-held boroughs, and several in private ownership.Ten years ago it was a Labour-run council, Southwark, that pleaded guilty to breaking fire safety regulations in what was then our worst tower block fire which killed six at Lakanal House.Kensington and Chelsea have acknowledged they handled the Grenfell disaster badly, exposing poor disaster management. The failures also laid bare how distant blue-collar North Kensington was from the preoccupations of a borough run by Tories from South Kensington and Chelsea.But many local authorities have been in one-party control for decades and are equally aloof. Many can thank their lucky stars that Grenfell didn\u0027t happen on their patch. They too would have been like rabbits in the headlights.Not that the political Right should come out of this with their heads held high. What is essentially a noble idea of simplifying rules long ago became an obsession and then a doctrine.Insulting phrases were routinely used to smear regulation as \u0027bureaucracy\u0027 and \u0027red tape\u0027, sometimes backed by a largely unfounded dogma, bordering certainty, that regulation damages the economy or is an afront to freedom, and that sweeping it away is a good thing in itself.In reality, there is always a trade-off between recklessness and being overcautious. That was the calculation the specifiers and contractors made when refurbishing Grenfell Tower, and it turns out they weren\u0027t cautious enough.But whoever is to blame, we should beware of blame itself. In the next phase of this inquiry attention will shift to the people who designed and carried out the Grenfell renovations.It might be therapeutic to find heads to put on platters, but, as so often, the focus will be on the little guys, the inidual designers and builders who, like most people, could never have imagined such a catastrophe could happen.We might call it justice, but it never does much good to punish people for making a genuine mistake, even if on reflection, they might or should have known better. In fact, blame can be inimical to safety — ask doctors or pilots.The police have a separate inquiry but criminal proceedings gag witnesses and reporters, and chasing essentially honest people will guzzle up another £40million.It is also a huge distortion for the already hard-pressed police. In any case, Grenfell has caused enough misery without ruining more lives.But above all, blaming iniduals will distract us from the big issue: complacency. Complacency which goes to the highest levels of the corridors of power.The complacency which for decades said we didn\u0027t need more rules and regulations, and insisted the cost equation for safety wasn\u0027t worth it.The complacency with which ministers and their mandarins maintained their insouciance even after the Lakanal House disaster in 2009.The complacency with which they still haven\u0027t brought forward plans to make sprinkler systems mandatory for social tenants.The people who made, or rather didn\u0027t make, those critical decisions are hiding in plain sight.Sir Martin promises he will uncover them as witnesses in phase two of his inquiry. But yet again we have to wait."},{"url":null,"title":"STEPHEN GLOVER cynical MPs claim sisterly solidarity Meghan Markle","story":"Share this article        The letter was spearheaded by Halifax MP Holly Lynch (pictured above) who said the MPs would \u0027stand with\u0027 the DuchessThis did not prevent Meghan from telephoning Ms Lynch yesterday to thank her for her support. According to the MP, she was ‘pleased to have seen that letter’.There is one wild and unsubstantiated accusation in it which tops all the others. It is that ‘some of these stories’ — naturally, no examples are given — have ‘outdated, colonial undertones’.Is this a suggestion that there is an element of anti-Americanism in the supposed hounding of Meghan by the vicious media? After all, the country of her birth, the United States, was once a colony.It’s possible, I suppose, but I think the MPs are getting at something else. They are implying, without quite daring to say as much, that news-papers’ criticisms of the Duchess of Sussex are partly motivated by racism.Of all the smears in this ill-conceived epistle of nonsense, this is easily the most outrageous — and also potentially the most damaging. What could lower the Press more in public esteem than the insinuation that it has a secret racist agenda against Meghan?It’s rot. And dangerous, politically driven rot at that. I have read countless articles about the Duchess in the mainstream media, and I haven’t come across a single example of anything remotely resembling racism in the faintest sense.If the MPs can dig up one shred of evidence to support their disgraceful innuendo, they should produce it forthwith. But, of course, they can’t — because it doesn’t exist.What they would very probably do, if forced to defend their idiocy, is to say that while there are no instances of racism to be found in Press coverage, it nonetheless underlies all the criticisms that are made of Meghan.In other words, if newspapers grumble about the hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on Meghan’s six-day ‘baby shower’ trip to New York earlier in the year (flying there and back by private jet), that is a clear case of racism.When some in the media express surprise that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should conceal the names of the godparents of Archie, who is seventh in line to the throne, that is another appalling manifestation of racism.         Both Meghan and Harry (above) have been critised for their actions - especially concealing Archie\u0027s god parents       And if columnists harrumphed after Harry delivered a lecture about the perils of global warming before he and Meghan took four journeys by private jet in 11 days, it was, of course, another expression of sublimated racism.Could anything be madder? Harry and Meghan are immensely privileged people in receipt of considerable public funds. For example, their home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was refurbished at a cost of more than £2.4 million of taxpayers’ money.But it would appear that whatever inconsistencies the Duke and Duchess may display, the Press is enjoined to stay schtum for fear of being accused of the worst form of bigotry.Such is the debased level of public debate in modern Britain. We are not talking about louts name-calling on a street corner but Members of Parliament (four of them in the Shadow Cabinet) who might be expected to show discrimination, intelligence and discernment.Let me add that I wish Harry himself would supply chapter and verse when lashing newspapers. He recently accused them of running ‘knowingly false and malicious stories’ and other such excesses without offering a single example. But he hasn’t — at least, not yet — accused them of racism.So what we have here are insidious and baseless accusations circulated by a group of female MPs. I don’t doubt that there is at least a smidgen of sisterly affection for the Duchess.         Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above) is thought to want to bring newspapers under a measure state control But the deeper motivation behind the letter is, of course, political. As I say, most signatories are Labour. And it is Jeremy Corbyn’s intention to bring newspapers under a measure of state control.Although details have not yet been revealed, the Labour leader spoke four years ago of the need for a ‘multiplicity of ownership’ in the Press. That might imply confiscation.Last year he warned news-papers that ‘change is coming’. A Labour administration could set in train a second Leveson Inquiry into newspapers. He has questioned Press freedom by claiming titles are ‘controlled by billionaire tax exiles’.The motives of many of the signatories of Holly Lynch’s letter should be partly interpreted in this light. If the Press is to be curbed, it is necessary to demonstrate that it has overstepped the bounds of decency and ignored people’s privacy.But, as I’ve argued, the women MPs have shown no such thing. They have made charges without foundation — without, indeed, bothering to adduce any evidence at all. Their cunning purpose is to disseminate the idea that newspapers are not to be trusted, and so should be regulated.How a handful of female Tory MPs could have been caught up in such a devious plot is bewildering, though it seems that some were astute enough to smell a rat, and refused to sign.It is even more regrettable that Meghan should have thanked Holly Lynch for her support. She has done what no member of the Royal Family should ever do by entering the political arena — whether deliberately or inadvertently I can’t say — and given comfort to the enemies of a free Press.Prince Harry is taking legal action against two national newspapers, and Meghan is suing the Daily Mail’s sister paper, the Mail on Sunday. The rights and wrongs of these cases need not concern us here.What should concern us, though, is the possibility that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex might foolishly broaden their battle with the Press and line up with Labour MPs intent on undermining its freedoms."},{"url":null,"title":"Tories set announce ban new fracking","story":"Share this article Encouraged by the success of the industry in the United States, former Chancellor George Osborne made racking a \u0027personal priority\u0027, pushing for tax breaks for operators and a fast-track planning process.But the technology has been highly controversial with environmental campaigners and some local communities because of its association with earth tremors.

Everyone is drunk and riding their horses. Get out of here – it’s too dangerous”’ Here, this horseman has broken away from the pack, but he wasn’t the frontrunner. The horses were racing on a track alongside a road. I don’t know exactly how many participants there were, but there were cars everywhere. Each family wants to drive next to their horse, everyone is beeping their horns, shouting. It is like a car race too, some slowing down, others speeding up, people overtaking on all sides. There’s some crazy driving, and so much dust in the air.I tried to take pictures before they started, but nobody really wanted to speak with me then and everyone was really nervous. When the race began, I took some shots from the ground, but then I jumped into a car and just hoped the photos would work out. I couldn’t really focus on what I was doing – you’re just trying not to have an accident. There were maybe 40 to 50 cars, and they were all quite beat up. You could tell they’d had accidents before.Afterwards, there was a huge party, right there, in the middle of the steppe. The horses were all beautifully dressed up and traditional Tuvan music was playing. The shaman had prayed the evening before for the spirits to be gentle. People come there to ask for healing.In Soviet times, Tuvan culture was suppressed. The shaman masks and  spirits – little puppets, sculptures, stuffed animals – were destroyed, and the people who continued to follow their ancient religions and traditions were persecuted. Now there’s this big revival, a newfound sense of pride.I grew up with Slavic fairytales about shamans and Baba Yaga. My mother is Russian and my grandfather was from Siberia. But I never really saw more of the country than Moscow, where I’d go to visit my grandmother in the summer. So last year I decided to go an exchange to Tomsk State University, in Siberia. I wanted to explore my roots.My plan was to travel the length of the Yenisei river. I couldn’t get to the actual source, which is further south in neighbouring Mongolia and only accessible by private helicopter. So I travelled to Tuva. You drive through what feels like endless Siberian woods and forested landscapes, you traverse one last mountain and suddenly you emerge on to the steppe. It feels like you’ve entered another world.People have gone there in search of freedom: adventurers, apostates, the Cossack riders pushing deeper and deeper into Siberia, criminals fleeing the Tsar. I met a man called Yuri who lived on a landfill. He told me if they chase him away, he’ll just find another landfill to live on. An ex-army officer I met, called Valentin, described himself as an anarchist ecologist. He sleeps outdoors, even when it’s -50C. This is one of the last remaining places where you can be removed from all western cultural influence, and live at one with nature.People in Tuva are tough. I’m attracted to people who are shaped by their environment, who choose to live or work in extreme situations. I think this kind of life fosters a certain kind of character. Not everyone chooses to live here, though. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva has become a place of great isolation, spiritual, physical and social.One day I went to a village where mostly Tuvan people live. Two grandmothers came outside. Perhaps because of the way I was dressed, they thought I was American. “What the hell are you doing here?” they said. “It’s Friday today. Everyone just got paid. Everyone is drunk, on their horses. Get out of here, it’s too dangerous.” And right then, two very drunk guys rode up to us. Nothing happened. But the horse came to symbolise for me this dualism – the quest for freedom and the pervasive isolation.• Nanna Heitmann is the winner of 2019’s Leica Oskar Barnack newcomer award for her series Hiding From Baba Yaga.Training: Photojournalism and documentary photography, University of Hanover.Influences: “The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow with its old Russian masters, the Magnum archive, Joel Sternfeld, Tarkovsky.”High point: “Every time I go out to photograph, to e into other people’s worlds.

However, out of an abundance of caution, we will have inspected 33 aircraft with more than 22,600 cycles by the end of the week rather than the seven months required,” the carrier told the ABC on Thursday.“Qantas would never operate an aircraft unless it was completely safe to do so.“Detailed analysis by Boeing shows that even when a crack is present, it does not immediately compromise the safety of the aircraft, as indicated by the timeframe given by regulators to perform the checks.”The problem came to light after Boeing said that it had found cracking in a part of the 737NG (the model before the troubled 737 Max) called the “pickle fork” on jets being overhauled in China.Purvinas told the ABC that repairs on this kind of crack take “months to fix” and require a special Boeing team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Asking a child or teenager “how are you?” can often be met with a standard “fine” as a response. That noise you hear? It’s the door slamming shut on your discussion.So whatever the situation, don’t be stuck for a way in – get talking with these cracking starters …You don’t have to kick things off on a serious note. In fact, some of our most valuable interactions come from having a laugh – lightening the mood can really help some people to open up and discuss how they’re feeling in greater depth. Why not try one of these openers?If you were stuck on a desert island …… and could have only one book, one album, and one meal forevermore, what would you choose and why? It’s the perfect gateway question to discovering a person’s favourite things, and then, of course, debating why they might be terrible or actually rather marvellous.If you won £10m, how would you spend it?What’s it going to be then? A fleet of sports cars? A private chef for life? Multiple trips to space on board a Virgin Galactic? All of the above? This one is great for stretching your imagination (in line with an imaginary bank balance).Would you rather? …This one is an endless source of amusement for every age. Kids particularly love grim options, such as “Would you rather be covered in fur or covered in scales?” Or “Would you rather be pelted with fish guts or horse poo?” These types of questions are a great way of winning over even the shyest of children.If you could go back in a time machine, where would you go and what would you do?You might want to change the course of political history, head into the distant past to see how the pyramids were really built, or check out a T-Rex in the flesh. The possibilities are fascinating and endless.Which super power would you have and why?Of course the answer is the power of flight. Or is it invisibility? Or teleportation? Or the ability to read minds – which would be terribly helpful to cat owners. Or would it be to have arms that can turn into giant crab pincers?Of course, there are times to have fun and times to try to reach out to those around you in a more considered way. It may be that your child has been unusually withdrawn, or that you’re aware that something isn’t right but haven’t been able to find the right words to open up a discussion with them. Here are a few options to try.How would you describe yourself in five words?This question can be a great way in for understanding how a person is feeling about themselves, and if they’re in a good place or having a hard time . Positive responses usually mean a positive outlook, while negative answers can help you glean a deeper understanding of what they’re struggling with.Tell me three things about your dayUnlike the classic “how was your day?” this question shows you have a real interest in the answer, and will prompt a more detailed, considered response that could potentially spark an important conversation. What was the hardest part of your day, and why?This might prove tricky to answer, but it can be a really useful question to ask if you feel that your child is in some kind of distress. By helping them pinpoint the most difficult part of their day, you might be able to unlock a broader discussion about how they’re feeling, and why.What are you thankful for today, and why?It may seem counterintuitive – especially if you’re in a hard place – but gratitude exercises can play an important role in improving mental wellbeing. Helping your child to pinpoint things they are thankful for every day, even if it’s just one or two small things, can help them lift their mood and gain some perspective.Is there anything that you need from me? Space, time to talk, time to do something fun? …Even if you manage to get them to open up, as a parent or carer, it can sometimes be hard to know how to best support a child or teenager who is having a hard time.

With no back-up any malfunction could trigger the plane into a e – as investigators believe happened with both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes, killing 346.The release of the document, in addition to warnings from Boeing’s chief test pilot that the MCAS system could engage without warning, adds to belief that Boeing overlooked safety in a rush to put the Max 737, its most profitable model, into production.The new email is among others unearthed during withering transportation committee hearings during which lawmakers have repeatedly assailed Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, over a failure to prioritize safety.“You have a systemic problem in your company. You’re driving profit. You’re not driving quality, and you’re sure as heck not driving safety,” the California Democrat John Garamendi told the chief executive.In another memo, a veteran Boeing production manager warned the company was placing the workforce under too much strain in its rush to speed up production of the jet.“Frankly right now, my internal warning bells are going off,” the manager wrote in the email, which was sent four months before the Indonesia crash. “And for the first time in my life, I’m sorry to say that I’m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane.”The email, which was sent to the general manager of the Max program, warned that workers on the Max assembly line were exhausted by the schedule and there should be a temporary halt.“I know this would take a lot of planning, but the alternative of rushing the build is far riskier,” the manager wrote.At the hearing, Muilenburg confirmed the note’s author had copied the warning to him, and he had answered them. However, Boeing did not slow its rate of production.Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told the hearing the manager had resigned his job at Boeing “because his concerns weren’t being addressed”.He accused Boeing of a “lack of candor” over the crashes, after John Hamilton, Boeing’s chief engineer, testified that the company had identified MCAS as the probable cause within days of the first crash and begun to work on a fix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c8b8d0f774a4f1e3f3eea67c1d8dcba2d421bf8/0_371_5558_3334/master/5558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=825537be9355c3171fbef421a9c1e947","title":"uks business rates system broken says treasury committee","story":"MPs tell government to urgently review tax it claims is high and unfair on physical stores The business rates system is broken and the government must undertake an urgent review to find alternatives, an influential committee of MPs has said.The Treasury committee said business rates in England and Wales were high, complex and placed an unfair burden on bricks-and-mortar shops and manufacturers compared with businesses that operate online.The cross-party group of MPs released their unanimous report as the economy teeters on the edge of recession, retailers and factory owners cut jobs and high street stores close.The MPs highlighted a complicated web of business rate reliefs and a system that punished investment. The committee also criticised a backlog of 16,000 appeals against business rate decisions and called for the government’s valuation office to be properly staffed.Business rates have risen faster than inflation since 1990 and grown as a share of taxes paid by companies, generating £31bn of income for the government last year, the MPs’ report found. The UK has the one of the highest property taxes as a share of output in the developed world, the report said.The committee called on the government to explain whether this was a deliberate policy and to consider the impact on economic growth. It said the chancellor should launch a review and report on alternatives in the spring.Alison McGovern, the MP who led the inquiry, said: “The current business rates system is broken. The tax represents an increasing burden on businesses, particularly those with a physical high street presence struggling to remain competitive.“The government must ensure that business rates align with its aim to boost productivity and do not disincentivise growth. The government must examine such alternatives in time for spring statement 2020.”Retailers and other industries have protested for many years about the burden imposed by business rates. In August more than 50 large retailers, including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Harrods, wrote to the chancellor calling on him to cut business rates to support declining high streets.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Business rates are a significant driver of store closures and job losses, and retailers have been getting a raw deal for too long. We urge political parties to support local shops, local shopworkers and local communities by including these recommendations in their manifestos.”A Treasury spokesman said: “We concluded a fundamental review of business rates in 2016 and have since introduced reforms and reliefs saving businesses more than £13bn over the next five years. We will respond to the select committee’s report in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f75d37dbe67cb269e5e16819cde298ac5d2c0f68/0_468_4836_2901/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b790a5fdbde62133ba381b75122b3f58","title":"what victorian era poverty maps tell us about london today","story":"A new edition of Charles Booth’s maps and research shows a London in which grinding poverty and wealth lived side by side. How different is today’s capital?“The parish is essentially sober but very immoral,” the Reverend H Bloomer told one of social reformer Charles Booth’s researchers at the end of the 19th century. He claimed to have been personally responsible for closing 20 brothels, though four to his knowledge remained.It’s not very shocking that my neighbourhood in Jeremy Corbyn’s North Islington constituency was a den of vice in late Victorian times. After all, Hornsey Road was formerly known as the Devil’s Lane and frequented by highwaymen. The superb Hornsey Road blog once attempted to exorcise my manor’s diabolical reputation with the ironic tag line “probably not over a hell mouth”. That suggestion of eternal recurrence would explain a lot about Hornsey Road – why present-day highwaymen on mopeds nicked the phone from my hands a few years ago why a London knife crime map would require a lot of ink in that section why the Hamlet Cafe, whose walls feature a reproduction of Delacroix’s graveyard scene, captures the manor’s gloomy vibe and why police and councillors clamped down on Aqua Sauna in 2013, saying the feared Romanian women found working there would be be “harmed or exploited”.More likely my manor isn’t cursed, just historically struggling against poverty. That’s what Booth tried to capture between 1886 and 1903 by surveying the capital. He and his team of researchers walked every street in London, filling 450 notebooks with their finds and producing 60 maps, hand-coloured to indicate the level of poverty. Now those maps and edited highlights from their reports are being republished with input from researchers at the London School of Economics. The LSE has an online facility to compare then with the current situation, with modern underlay maps beneath Booth’s poverty maps.“Surely this is the right moment,” argues Iain Sinclair in the book’s foreword, “when isions between the visibly wretched and the invisibly rich in corporate, de-localised London are becoming critical, to publish a handsome, reconfigured presentation of Charles Booth’s inspirational reckoning?”Some things have not changed hugely in London. The map indicates a huge workhouse on Cornwallis Road like so many other smithies and factories, it’s long gone, and the site is now an adventure playground and park. But in November 1897, one of Booth’s researchers, George H Duckworth – who was not only an Etonian, a Cambridge cricket blue but also Virginia Woolf’s half-brother – strolled up Hornsey Road with Insp William Dyball, describing it as “a road of small shops that depend for their existence on local knowledge: they give credit which the large houses on Holloway Rd and 7 Sisters Rd will not do”. That sounds about right: even today, chain stores are rare and buying products “on tick” is possible, as long as the proprietors know you.On Booth’s poverty map, terraces running perpendicular to Hornsey Road are coloured brown, which means: “Mixed. Some comfortable, others poor.” My cul de sac, running parallel to Hornsey Road, still fits that description. We’ve got all sorts down here – Poles, Afghans, Pakistanis, City traders, tube train drivers, Nigerians, Cypriots, Muslims worshipping at the mosque round the corner, non-Muslims worshipping at the William Hill next door, council tenants, a declining number of people of Irish descent, Hooray Henry private tenants. Not to mention people like me who bought cheaply these modest late Victorian ex-council houses after Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy legislation and are now sitting on nest eggs that scramble the property market so as to exclude younger people.Beyond my garden fence, there was once a street of grander houses coloured red for “Middle class, well to do”. The Luftwaffe did for them as they did for many of the homes in Booth’s map. Today Tollington Place’s bomb site is Wray Crescent Open Space, with cricket pitch, playground, and community-maintained raised beds. Let’s not overstate the bucolic makeover, however: the leafy corners have long proved handy for drug deals.Not far away from Tollington Place on Booth’s map is a street that sticks out like a sore thumb, since it is coloured black, signifying as Booth put it: “Lower class. Vicious, semi-criminal”. That was Campbell Road, aka the Bunk, which from the 1860s until it was cleared as a slum in the 1950s was known as the worst street in London. Nearby, next to Hornsey Road Baths are two streets coloured light blue, defined as: “Poor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family.” On the other side of Hornsey Road are two streets coloured dark blue, defined as: “Very poor, casual. Chronic want.”These mean streets have been disappeared, but the neighbourhood still retains some of its earlier character. Those light blue streets, Marcellus Road and Orpingley Road, were both demolished in 1972 to make way for the Andover Estate, where Ann Widdecombe once made an exploitation doc about her battle with “the hoodies”, to which the local youth responded with their own YouTube documentary Beyond the Hoodie.The dark blue streets, Denmark Terrace and Ellenborough Road have also gone, replaced by the jewel in my neighbourhood’s social housing crown: Sussex Place, described in Pevsner as “an eight-storey crescent in red brick with lower blocks enclosing a garden: an ambitious post-war Islington scheme of 1950 by Monson, spaciously laid out, in startling contrast to the tight street of low stuccoed houses which then existed all around.” It’s as though the council was trying to lift the historic curse.In other parts of the city, however, the change to London has been dramatic. I look at Booth’s map of King’s Cross: the black-coloured streets are gone as gentrification sweeps across the formerly desolate railway land behind the station the then functioning gasometers, Booth would have been astounded to discover, have been repurposed as luxury flats – £810,000 for a studio and rising into the many millions for a penthouse, but handy for workers at Google’s London HQ nearby.One of Booth’s volunteers asked a police constable to describe Clerkenwell, just up the road from Shoreditch. He responded that it was a “melting pot” of London. Which sounds like a lovely meeting point for migrant communities, prefiguring the cosmopolitan London of the 21st century. Not really: what he meant was that Clerkenwell was “where all the stolen silver or jewels come to be melted or disassembled”. It’s less Dickensian and more genteel than that today.I wander off Seven Sisters Road to find out what happened to the Bunk. Today it is called Whadcoat Street, an anonymous dead end that became briefly notorious a couple of years ago when a terrorist drove into a crowd of Muslim worshippers nearby, killing a man.On the other is City North, a vast new development around and above Finsbury Park tube, where flats of up to £850,000 are being advertised overseas, as if the better to attract the speculative investors who have already put much of London’s property beyond its citizens, thus adding to the inequality and poverty in the capital identified by Trust for London.• Charles Booth’s London Poverty Maps is published on 31 October by Thames and HudsonFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text, it’s the kind you might read with your four-year-old. It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank.It’s a No-Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny, while shielding her from the painful stuff. “There’s no more cereal, so I have the last piece of toast. Luckily Mum isn’t hungry,” the girl says and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie. When they reach the food bank, the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped.Only just published, it is believed to be the UK’s first picture book about food banks. And, while the subject has been handled compassionately by the prize-winning author Kate Milner, I can’t help but see that landmark as a disgrace – for all of us. It is the watershed moment when Britain’s food banks go from newspaper headlines to a subject that teachers cover in classrooms the moment at which mass destitution is no longer a badge of political failure but is instead accepted as part of British life.As recently as 10 years ago, child poverty was an evil that prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both vowed to abolish now it is something you shamefacedly explain to your child as he or she nestles in your lap.Picture books used to be small worlds where kids could dream about farmyard animals and cuddly monsters today they teach about the vast number of people that their parents’ generation treat like dirt. In 2016 David Cameron casually dropped the legally binding targets to reduce child poverty – and those figures jumped. More than 4 million children live in poverty in the UK today – or nine kids in every classroom of 30. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks, giving 14,000 food parcels a year to children. It operated 428 food banks last year, handing nearly 580,000 parcels to children. This is a charity that sees itself as temporary. Our failure as a society is making it permanent.In one of the richest societies in human history, such figures should mortify us, yet the Westminster classes take them as unremarkable. They hardly ever trouble TV bulletins or newspaper columns, while Conservative cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove sneer at the impoverished for not being able to “manage their finances”.As the UK staggers into a rage-filled general election, well-lunched gasbags will solemnly inform us that this is an election about “getting Brexit done” – while ignoring the cuts, the broken economy and the other causes that helped to drive the Brexit vote of 2016. Dealing with those causes would entail being winched out of the deep embrace of the TV studio sofas, tearing out the IV drip that feeds them the untreated bullshit of No 10 “sources”, and seeing more of the country than could ever be conveyed in a fleeting vox pop.If the experts did that, they would confront a society where levels of deprivation once considered shameful are now treated as normal where what was scratched together just a few months ago is now relied on as part of the new, ad hoc welfare state.This week I went to Colchester, in Essex, to see something both brilliant and saddening: a Munch Club. In a small scout hut on the postwar Monkwick housing estate, 45 children and their parents were getting a free lunch to ease the expense of half-term holidays. Tiny kids were burrowing into mountains of chicken nuggets and chips before collecting chocolate cake in custard. There’ll be Munch Clubs across the town this week, run by volunteers and depending on donations. They’re the idea of Maureen Powell, a local pensioner with a sharp blond bob and a smoker’s laugh. She started here just a year ago, and by Christmas plans to run no fewer than six Munch Clubs. People keep asking her to lay on more, and she thinks she knows the number-one reason why.To keep the clubs going, Powell often raids her state pension while her small home is crammed with four freezers and three fridges to store supplies. As indicated by the crutch with which she hobbles, she has her own issues – arthritis, asthma and secondary multiple sclerosis. Let me speak plainly: Powell is a hero, yet nothing about this system feels like an adequate replacement for a proper welfare state. Except that’s not something the UK can say it really has any more – not when the state prefers literally to melt 50p pieces of hubris rather than keep citizens from starving.At one table sit Gary and Rebecca, surrounded by their five kids. She raises the children, while he stacks shelves at a supermarket. When his wages hit their bank account, the money is all gone on bills by that same afternoon. Their universal credit top-up is just not enough.If they weren’t at the Munch Club, “neither Gary nor me would eat anything till dinner, so as to leave more for the kids”, says Rebecca. How do they cope with the hunger? “You get used to it,” she shrugs.Their children get neither sweets nor treats, and their parents can’t afford to take them to Colchester zoo or the fireworks. I think about the classroom tradition of talking about what you did in your holidays and wonder what these kids say. I wonder how tough things get at home, and how much they overhear.Not far away is Bevan Close, a reminder of the Labour minister who built this estate. Nye Bevan wanted communities founded on fairness, where “the doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all live in the same street”. What has replaced his vision? When Cameron entered No 10, Colchester borough council received £11m a year from Whitehall. It’s a sum that has dropped and dropped: this year it is £275,000 next year, precisely zero. Common lawns on the estate used to get cut every month now it’s only three times a year. Police officers used to patrol on foot now, says councillor Dave Harris, “the only time a cop car turns up is when there’s really bad news”. The large NHS clinic, where parents took newborns to be weighed, is now shuttered up.We could talk about austerity or tough choices, but something far more profound has happened here – a poor area a couple of hours from Westminster has been systematically stripped of some of the rudiments of civilised life. This is the new normal for swaths of Britain: where a man can be declared fit for work shortly before dying where headteachers have to beg parents for toilet roll where children must rely on a sick pensioner to keep them fed out of term time.That’s what this election is really about: not Brexit, not Boris v Jezza, but how we define a civilised society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eadf39af58c86e5a6f5a8aef3aa5c1b67d47254/0_10_3825_2295/master/3825.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9934b79df3b0d9c2c667ddeaeaf58013","title":"people passionate politics radical solutions labour election tory austerity","story":"For two and a half years, British politics has been a pantomime played out in the corridors and boardrooms of Westminster and Brussels. The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in: much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny. Instead, ever since Boris Johnson’s ascent to the premiership, the country has effectively been treated to a one-sided general election campaign the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage. All of this now changes: the spectators can storm the stage.In the 00s, it was often claimed that political apathy had replaced political participation. Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline. Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now? This is our age of mass politics: the Scottish independence movement, Farageism and Brexitism, a youth-led climate emergency movement, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe’s biggest political party. And it is this, in large part, that makes the election so unpredictable, so volatile. There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point – desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence. If Johnson triumphs, his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to punch a hole the size of Wales in the economy, and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper-Thatcherite mould. Labour’s mission, on the other hand, is to up-end a generation-long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries. Each represents an abandonment of the old order, even though the Tories’ version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them.The Tories’ strategy is clear: use Brexit to torture Labour by iding its electoral coalition and drowning out its domestic agenda. Their secret weapons are Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats, who they hope will siphon enough votes from Labour to deliver scores of marginals to the Conservatives – even though Labour is now the only major party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Most of the British press will act as Johnson’s cheerleaders, and the Tories’ traditional donors – hedge fund managers, financiers, magnates – will keep them flush with money.But it is mass politics that presents the party with a challenge. After MPs voted to approve a December election, the grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum movement launched an appeal to raise £50,000 in 48 hours instead, it raised £100,000 in the first 12 hours, twice as much as in the same time period in 2017, and with an average donation of £24.40. It belies claims that enthusiasm for the Labour leadership has collapsed among a demoralised membership. And if that commitment to part with money is matched by a willingness to knock on doors, the party will be able to partly bypass an overwhelmingly hostile press and talk to voters one-on-one.It is mass politics, too, which challenges the Tories’ ability to monomaniacally focus on Brexit at the exclusion of all else. Polling shows that the environment has risen dramatically as a political priority for voters since January: a new poll finds that two-thirds of Britons believe the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humanity, with more than half declaring that it would affect how they voted. This is, in part, down to protests by the Youth Strike 4 Climate and Extinction Rebellion. Labour’s radical policies for a Green New Deal – which link tackling the climate emergency to creating jobs, overhauling public transport and improving living standards – have yet to cut through. But in an election campaign, we can expect there to be an appetite to hear such proposals.But focusing on the misery of Tory Britain is a trap. Instead, Labour’s campaign should exude a relentless optimism: a sense that a nation this wealthy has the resources to overcome every injustice and challenge if the willpower is there. The age of mass politics is one that demands radical solutions rather than tinkering. Labour may begin the campaign with dire polling, but Tory despair under Theresa May has given away once again to hubris. The movements and struggles of the last decade have politicised millions to demand a breach with a failing social order. It is that resurgence of people power that Labour must tap into – and which Johnson’s Tories should surely fear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea0d1c84287a650a86e43cc85e341ddaab3b60d/0_86_3343_2005/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6f48422dcbb091ccef483ca6ae31e89","title":"the guardian view on a volatile electorate disunited and unpredictable","story":"The fanfare at the launch of a general election tends to obscure the reality that Britain’s voting system involves hundreds of very particular local elections.That constituency variation, combined with unusual volatility in party identification, makes the poll due on 12 December highly unpredictable. Brexit has shuffled conventional loyalties, forcing the Conservatives in particular to seek support on unfamiliar terms. A recent report by the Conservative thinktank Onward identifies “rugby league towns” – places such as Workington, Warrington and Wakefield – as the arena for a new type of political contest. These are places weighed down by economic and social insecurity. They voted leave in 2016 and Labour a year later. Conventional Thatcherite Toryism, preaching liberation through inidual enterprise, has little purchase there. But Boris Johnson needs to advance on that front to compensate for a pro-EU migration to the Liberal Democrats in seats that used to be comfortably Tory.Meanwhile, Labour hope to woo remainers in cities and university towns without alienating pro-Brexit voters in their heartland seats who might defect to the Tories, or Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Jeremy Corbyn’s method is to campaign on non-European issues: economic fairness funding for public services. That might be a viable strategy given voter fatigue with all things Brexit and the salience of more local concerns. But Labour must also overcome Mr Corbyn’s dismal personal ratings. Doubt about the leader’s fitness for office haunts some of the party’s MPs.No party can take anyone’s vote for granted. It is almost certain that conventional wisdom in some area or other will be upended in December. What is often described as national volatility expresses the inadequacy of national narratives in describing Britain. This is not a new phenomenon, but political fragmentation seems to be accelerating. It is matched by economic ergence. While the UK economy as a whole has grown consistently over the past decade, data from the Office for National Statistics show that the north-east and south-west of England, for example, have experienced three recessions during that period. It is hardly surprising that politics as broadcast from Westminster sounds in some parts of the country like a signal from an alien planet.Campaign strategists try to compensate by using data analysis to customise messages, which can then be fed to the target’s computer screen. That can be an effective mobilising technique, but it is no substitute for cultivating support by delivering real benefits for people and their communities. Those allegiances have frayed in many places over many years. The coming election will reveal quite how drastically the electoral geography of the country needs to be redrawn.

Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls.There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat – the charity Hubbub recently estimated that throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m plastic bottles. And, if that wasn’t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away.Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets andor alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine.While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year – sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween.The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson – this year’s pop culture baddie – is the obvious look just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it.“Avocado” was the word of the first half of this decade and “surreal” has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen RooneyWagatha Christie look.No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add “sexy” to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called – it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the “winner” of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum’s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown. Jessica Biel dressing as her husband Justin Timberlake (the ‘NSync era version) also podiums here. File under: because internet.It is like virtue-signalling, but without morals, and it is major. Obviously you have flawless taste, so this is your time to shine. Be the Hot Priest from Fleabag. (Also: so easy. Don’t forget the can of G\u0026ampT.) Or pay homage to Succession: is there anything scarier than Logan in a shawl-collar cable knit? Note: you can’t do Stranger Things – that was old last year.The late Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved kitten are the Gomez and Morticia of the 2019 Halloween circuit. For Karl, dust your hair with talcum powder, flip up the collar of your stiffest white shirt and pin in place with a fancy brooch. If you don’t have a brooch, one of those pearl hairclips that are everywhere and a couple of safety pins will do the trick. Add black shades, fingerless gloves, a fan and a can of Diet Coke. For Choupette, white cat ears and a mohair jumper should do it. If you are keen to show off your abs, there is always J-Lo in that green dress on the Versace catwalk. Or for insider fashion lolz, raid secondhand stores for a tweed suit and a boater hat and channel the gatecrasher who stormed the Chanel runway at Paris fashion week this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4228cbe7b2c054b50830b784808223f6539e34/0_1023_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe7b8bb88086dc5ecfdf3dde73fed67e","title":"gorpcore why people who rarely go outside are wearing hiking gear","story":"A new retailer is coming to the UK, specialising in clothes for the urbanite who likes to look as if they’re off to the Himalayas. It’s the natural evolution of a baffling trendLove wearing a fleece but hate the thought of being five minutes away from a Starbucks? Prefer to observe your scenic views from the comfort of your computer? Then you will be into Snow Peak - the hipster Japanese outdoors shop that is coming to the UK. However, the clothes it sells are styled less for a leisurely ramble over a muddy munro and more for wearing in an ironically captioned selfie, looking a bit weather-worn.“I wanted to create clothes that are functional, practical but also stylish,” designer Lisa Yamai told Vogue. “I wanted to make outdoor clothes that you wouldn’t just wear at the weekend clothes you could wear seven days a week, that will make the outdoors feel more familiar.”Essentially, it is a very different look to the one you would pick up at your local branch of Blacks. Snow Peak is the natural destination for the urbanite who likes to wear a look that suggests they will be asking their nearest and dearest to sponsor a Himalayan hike very, very soon (but almost certainly not doing one).It sells elevated, high-fashion fishing vests, “outdoor kimonos” and, yes, lots of fleeces. Its aesthetic is very much where utility-wear is now – where luxury meets usefulness and functionality is the new decoration.Although the term was coined by The Cut in 2017, it still feels significant in the era of Generation Greta. It is a style that semaphores a healthy and clear objective. “Clothing that fits a purpose and does what it says will always be relevant to men,” Nick Paget, the senior menswear editor at trend-forecasting agency WGSN, said at the time.But like the power gilet in Succession, the look is also a humble power brag, a sartorial, ever-so-slightly judgey bit of virtue signalling: about being your most Bear Grylls-ish self.Think of the Jesus Is King-era Kanye West posing in the wilds of his Wyoming farm or Richard Madden on the cover of Interview magazine looking like he is just having a tea break after a spot of drywalling.A recent New York Times headline about warcore, the gorier sequel to gorpcore, squealed: “If you can get killed doing it, fashion wants it”.

Well it’s got one now, adapted by director Mike Flanagan from Stephen King’s 2013 followup novel. It is more than half an hour longer than the Stanley Kubrick film, although it seems more than that – laborious, directionless and densely populated with boring new characters among whom the narrative focus is muddled and split. Your attention is distracted from the central figure, who might otherwise have been an actual object of fascination: Danny Torrance, once the kid in the Overlook hotel, pedalling his trike around the eerily endless corridors and eventually pursued by his axe-wielding dad, unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson. The Kubrick movie, from 1980, famously disliked by King, is a stylistic influence on this sequel, which references the big moments. (King has an executive producer credit. So perhaps he came round to it.)Now Danny (forthrightly played by Ewan McGregor) is all grownup, unemployed, homeless, addled with alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the grisly finale in the snow at the end of the first story. His mum, Wendy, died not long after they moved away young Wendy is played in flashback by Alex Essoe. Adult Danny is still burdened with the telepathic power of “shining” (past tense “shined” not “shone”), but he has cultivated the art of shutting up his Overlook demons in imaginary boxes in his mind.After drifting, boozing and brawling from town to town, Danny finally goes into Alcoholics Anonymous. His fellow AA attendees find him a place to stay and a job as an orderly in a hospice, where he gets the fond nickname Doctor Sleep because of his telepathic empathy with those poor souls in extremis, gently shepherding them to the final slumber. Elsewhere, though, new supernatural forces both good and bad are on the march. A girl, wittily named Abra (Kyliegh Curran), has powers like Danny’s, and really needs his mentorship, like the guidance Danny once got from wise old Dick Hallorann (originally played by Scatman Crothers, here by Carl Lumbly). There is a sinister new evil band on the loose: a gang of vampiric parasites preying on children, led by a creepy hippyish figure called Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). They inhale the life-force “steam” from their horribly slaughtered young victims.The questions to ask about any Shining sequel obviously relate to the scariest thing in the first film: the hand-holding twins in the corridor. How about them? Could they somehow have grown up into ghostly adult twins now? Will they have an amusing and ingeniously conceived role to play in the sequel? Will Danny wind up getting off with one, without realising the other one’s hiding in the wardrobe? Well, I wish there were satisfying answers to these questions. Instead, the central evil role is disappointingly assigned to Rose the Hat, who just isn’t as scary or interesting.Eventually, after a long, long series of pointless narrative detours, we find ourselves back in the ruined Overlook hotel, and there’s a frisson there, undoubtedly – especially when we see the hole in the wall made by Torrance’s axe as he shouted “Heeeeere’s Johnny!” But it is almost cancelled out by the realisation that everything before it has been a bit redundant. Despite some big moments, this seems cumbersome and unnecessary: a dimming of the original.• Doctor Sleep is released in the UK on 31 October, in Australia on 7 Nov and in the US on 8 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493d45f9977076fd2d7262e376bfd40ebc456295/548_758_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f628f4e0223685f78a899afb43dcc271","title":"winter weight why our hunger is rising rapidly and how to sate it","story":"As the sunlight recedes and your body tries to compensate with food, it’s time to break out the stews and soupsI once did an idle poll of all the ways people’s mothers had called them fat and my favourite … well, it was a joint three-way between: “You could eat one more potato than a pig”, “Your brother is slimmer and more handsome, but that’s made him arrogant” and “Darling, you’re at what I would call your winter weight.” Ah, winter weight: is it a real thing or just a caustic critique? It’s both.Some people don’t get hungrier when the seasons change and think it’s one of those things that happens to women, and bears. Those people are the outliers they just don’t know it. A drop in ambient temperature increases energy expenditure in both sexes (also in bears). It shouldn’t matter enormously on a basic calories-in-calories-out model, because we’re talking just 150 calories a day. You use extra energy, you eat a banana this is the smallest inconvenience the change in seasons has to offer, less annoying than having to find your cagoule. However, the human body being somewhat more complicated than a basic book-keeping system, all your appetite hears is the activation. It’s like the Hulk. It doesn’t want to do just one job. It’s a force of nature, not a supplier of goods and services. It wants to burst out of its clothes and keep on going until you, too, have burst out of your clothes.There’s also a serotonin angle, as the sunlight recedes and your hormonal pathways try to source joy from other places, at which point a banana won’t cut it. And then, of course, there’s a feedback loop. You start by craving refined carbohydrates for a reason, but then you want more cake because you just had cake, as with heroin.There’s a strong argument that says: who cares? Be your winter weight. And, sod it, while you’re there, why not eat one more potato than a pig? But let’s say you’re one of those people who hates being at the mercy of uncontrollable forces under the skin. There are things to eat in winter that don’t come from Greggs.The point isn’t that you should eat hot food because it increases your body temperature from the inside. It doesn’t create a little pocket of heat in your stomach that emanates to your extremities for the rest of the day – it’s food, not uranium the Ready Brek ad was basically mis-selling. But complex carbohydrates take more energy to digest, so will be both satiating and warming, which leads inexorably to the stew or hearty soup.I start with pearl barley. I’m always bored with it by Christmas and by June I’ve forgotten how to cook it (it’s easy, like rice, only takes four times as long), but in the first cold snap it is powerfully cheering and fills your kitchen with a delicious, heady smell, as if you were living in a 16th-century brewery and will be ready for a massive knees-up in six months’ time. Delia Smith’s One Is Fun – perhaps the most controversial work in her canon, having caused lifelong rifts since the 1980s as friends presented it to each other as a passive-aggressive gift item (“You’re going to be alone for ever, at least eat nice soup”) – has a pearl barley soup of such substance, such rough but pleasing texture (squishy no, wait, chewy no, wait, slightly sticky ah, hang on, also crunchy) and such an ancient vibe – you can taste the centuries of embedded knowledge, one generation passing carrot-wisdom on to the next, back into the mists of time – that while you’re on the first bowl, you feel as though you could eat it every day, for every meal, for ever. This will, unfortunately, turn out not to be true.I don’t want to bang on about meat, painfully aware of how often I’ve claimed to be nearly vegan and then had a salt-beef sandwich. But the classic stew is barley with lamb, and William Drabble’s recipe is as close to perfect as it gets.This will all take a lot longer than pasta and someone is sure to bang on about their slow cooker, and how it revolutionised their lives, because suddenly they were chopping onions at 7.25 in the morning and coming home to a delicious meal of very intense onions. I find this a slightly saddening life fix because part of the pleasure of making a stew is feeling that it was your skill – browning it, poking it, going back to have a look at it – that brought it to that point of excellence. Also, all those delicious smells, like a full-house scented candle made of food, except not £65 (there is no stew as expensive as a candle, except cassoulet). It’s better to make it on a Sunday and eat it all week. When you feel the painful monotony on around Thursday, you can add aioli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed8cbae8fd9115ddceaed75f83221b5b83d90b2/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1a32c72e1a437aba540bae9557bce2","title":"yam dunk how we fell in love with sweet potatoes","story":"Britons prefer them to traditional tatties, but we’ve hardly begun to plumb their tender depths – there’s much more to them than fancy chips or Thanksgiving pieHere’s a seasonal question for you. When James Taylor sat down to write about the childhood sweetheart who had finally agreed to be his girl, which vegetable metaphor did he plump for?The sweet potato. That’s right. “Oh Lord, I feel fine today,” he crooned on his 1988 album Never Die Young. “I’m walking on cloud nine today …”Why, you ask. “I’m prepared to tell you why,” he replies. “It’s strictly on account of my sweet potato pie.”Although few women would be delighted to be compared, however loosely, to a dish made with starchy tubers, Taylor does a decent job of selling it, and its main ingredient. It is tender, he says, it’s sweet, it’s soft and deep it’s soulful.If you’ve ever had a slow-roasted batch of this succulent vegetable, you’ll know he’s right. Sweet potatoes – now at the peak of their season – are the business.They are also big business. Over the past decade, according to Kantar Worldpanel, demand for sweet potatoes in the UK has quadrupled. For a while, they mostly came from warmer climes – North Carolina, Israel – but in 2015, farmers in Kent pulled out all the stops to put a UK-grown crop in the supermarkets. That same year, the Office for National Statistics included the sweet potato in the illustrative shopping basket it uses to measure inflation. And last year, consumer research showed most people would opt for a sweet potato side dish over a straight-up potato one. Yet most of us have only begun to plumb those tender, sweet, soulful depths.First up, sweet potatoes don’t have to be orange. Those Kentish farmers chose to cultivate the familiar red-skinned, flame-fleshed variety, often known as yams in the southern US. But if you have a Caribbean market stall or an Asian grocer nearby, you can probably get hold of something different. There are purple sweet potatoes, white sweet potatoes, yellow sweet potatoes. With the variations in colour come differences in texture, density, flavour and uses. The food website Saveur has a tantalising guide to 16 kinds, from the tan-skinned hannah, which bakes into a soft, dry yellow, perfect for mashing, to korean purple, with its white flesh and magenta exterior yielding a subtle chestnut flavour. If you can, try them all.Sweet potato fries or baked wedges are, it would appear, the thing that has pushed the root veg into the mainstream. And it is hard to argue with them. The food writer Anna Jones recommends coating wedges in polenta before baking – it crisps them up nicely. She serves hers with a chipotle yoghurt dipping sauce. If you want to deep-fry yours, Felicity Cloake cautions that they are best thick-cut, par-boiled (with a little bicarb) and coated in a cornflour paste (she spikes hers with paprika), then rolled in cornmeal.There is, however, more to sweet potatoes than chips. The Mississippi-born chef Brad McDonald, in his book Deep South, does a smoked pork belly served with a spiced sweet potato casserole topped with pecan praline and Italian meringue. Yotam Ottolenghi mixes them, roasted, with pickled onion, coriander and goat’s cheese as an accompaniment to fish or chicken. Vegans and “clean-eaters”, meanwhile, routinely tout the virtues of the sweet potato just as much as any meat eater.Depending, of course, on what you load them up with, sweet potatoes are a healthier option than conventional potatoes. They are lower in carbohydrates and calories, and higher in fibre and vitamin A. Their sweetness marries with a host of aromatics – from paprika to cinnamon, thyme to cumin and coriander. And their creaminess suggests all manner of pairings: sour cream, salsa verde, miso, chilli. Nigel Slater steams slices to make a fragrant split orange lentil dal that he serves with fresh coriander. And Melissa Hemsley uses chunks as the base for a lemongrass-infused chickpea and coconut curry. Sweet potatoes also make an excellent starting point for a soup, a stew, a bake or a pie.The traditional sweet potato pie – a Thanksgiving classic – is made with butter, flavoured with vanilla and cinnamon, encased in shortcrust and served with whipped cream. Deb Perelman of the Smitten Kitchen blog went through a southern food infatuation, as she put it, a few years back, but hankered after something a little lighter for afters. She found it in the Lee Brothers’ buttermilk sweet potato pie – more cheesecake than stodge.Tanya Harris, of the My Forking Life blog, does a mean vegan take on the trad Jamaican sweet potato pudding using coconut milk, brown sugar and allspice, but forgoing the rum you would find in other recipes. Jamaican sweet potatoes are of the denser kind, meaning the pudding is more cake-like. But even if you only have orange jewel sweet potatoes and have to spoon the resulting bake into a bowl, it will still be delicious.Then there are the many Japanese sweets to be made with the vegetable. The most popular is a double-baked beauty: sweet potato puree with butter, sugar, cream and egg. A scattering of black sesame seeds on top, and you’re golden.Mostly though, it’s best to remember that the sweet potato doesn’t need much doing to it to be perfect. It is one of those culinary failsafes, a foil to every kitchen foible. There are vendors in Japan who park vans on street corners and belt out: “Ishi yaki imo”, which means stone-baked sweet potato. That is all they are selling. One bite of the piping-hot tat wrapped in newspaper and you’re sold. You’re going home to rustle up more of the same in a hot, hot oven. Slow-roasting the potato in its skin means the moisture is retained and the sugars in the skin caramelise. As savoury as it is sweet, this is a whole warming meal for cold hands on a winter’s day. And that’s something to sing about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477bec7f6df4136026ff7d2abe0ee3a0a4dcba9a/0_155_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b4e272007a8492dfbcc4fa750acb182","title":"atletico madrid manchester city womens super league match report","story":"Manchester City’s third consecutive defeat was the most damaging, a loss that cut deep. Beaten by Manchester United, beaten by Arsenal, they were beaten by Atlético Madrid, knocked out of Europe at the hands of the same team who eliminated them last year.A late goal from Pauline Bremer set up a frantic final few minutes but in the end a Steph Houghton own goal and a second from Angela Sosa was enough to take Atlético through, 2-1 on the night, 3-2 on aggregate, and end City’s European ambitions.For City, twice semi-finalists, this was hard to take and there were tears at the final whistle. “This will hurt,” the manager, Nick Cushing, said. “We’re in a difficult period but we were knocked out a round earlier last year and won two trophies. We haven’t lost three in a row since 2015 but we just need to make sure we keep believing and we will be fine.”For Atlético, it was historic. They have never been this far in the competition. Their manager, Pablo López, who injured himself jumping about in the tension of the final minutes, said: “It’s amazing, seeing them in the dressing room singing, jumping, dancing. All I can say is thanks for having taken this historic step. I am immensely happy. It’s wonderful to see how happy they are.”City had needed a goal from the start but did not get it until the 88th minute, their first goal in three matches. By then Atlético had two and City could not add to theirs – although for a few, heart-stopping moments it seemed they might.Ellen White was sent through on the left only for her shot to drift wide of the far post for the first chance early on and, soon after, Jill Scott’s effort was blocked. But if that appeared to be a warning, urgency only arrived when the situation became critical and by then it was too late. Cushing said he felt his side had dominated but admitted they could not create meaningful chances and lamented bad luck. “It happens in football,” he said.Atlético, by contrast, did threaten. A lovely touch from Ludmila da Silva, flicking inside for Sosa, saw her set Toni Duggan away. Shifting the ball on to her right foot, heading horizontally into the area, Duggan was preparing to shoot when the door was closed. From a Sosa corner Ludmila’s header was scrambled away for another one, from which Aïssatou Tounkara could not keep her attempt down.Then the goal came, five minutes before the break. Sosa found a way out of a crowd, clipping a diagonal ball to the right-hand side for Kenti Robles. She combined with Virginia Torrecilla before sending a long cross dropping behind Gemma Bonner. It seemed to be going out but Ludmila breathed life into the move, keeping the ball from crossing the byline and sending it rebounding off Houghton and into the goal.City had not scored in their previous two games and Atlético looked the more likely to find the net. City rarely convinced, although a run from deep by Lauren Hemp saw her deliver a superbly weighted pass to White only for Sari van Veenendaal to e out and block.Corral and Ludmila – so direct, so fast, so hard to contain – set up Atlético’s second. Ellie Roebuck had to save at the near post after Charlyn Corral’s sprint up the left. Duggan and Sosa sent Ludmila away, only for her to be dragged down by Megan Campbell. Carmen Menayo hit wide. And then off went Corral again, streaking into the area. Roebuck saved, twice, at the near post but the ball deflected to Sosa, who scored from close range.A long looping header that could have been the first of the two goals City now needed thudded back off the bar. When they finally did score, it came from a long throw, turned in by Bremer.Atlético, so comfortable a few minutes before, appeared scared. Another long throw almost led to an equaliser and City’s passage to the quarter-finals but it was the Spanish side who progressed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691947f5c3690401b07f46967faa417009660131/0_130_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01c86f7162d152b5c29e87205a342fe3","title":"chelsea manchester united carabao cup report marcus rashford","story":"There have been few moments to match this level of fantasy from Manchester United in recent times. This is a club whose identity is built around turning impossible dreams into unforgettable realities but too many players have looked uncomfortable wearing that famous red shirt of late. The modern United have been too safe, too bland, and they have put out too many sides without the courage to deliver under pressure.Not this time, though. This time there was magic. It materialised when Marcus Rashford, who turns 22 on Thursday, stood over a free-kick in the 73rd minute and decided to try his luck from 30 yards. Lesser players might not have had the confidence but Rashford trusted in his technique and produced something special, stunning Stamford Bridge with a rocket that wobbled through the air and flew into the top corner. “A bolt out of the blue,” Frank Lampard said. “No team can stop that.”Chelsea’s manager was right but Rashford’s inidual brilliance was not the only reason United are through to the last eight of the Carabao Cup. This was also a strategic triumph for Ole Gunnar Solskjær, whose counterpunching tactics worked in the opening period, as did his decision to make two attacking substitutions when Chelsea were on top midway through the second half.United, who are unbeaten in four matches, were rewarded for responding positively when Michy Batshuayi cancelled out Rashford’s early penalty with an excellent strike in the 61st minute. Instead of falling back, they rediscovered their attacking zest. Solskjær turned to his bench, bringing on Anthony Martial and Andreas Pereira for Victor Lindelöf and Jesse Lingard, and switching to a back four allowed United to regain control of a game that seemed to be slipping from their grasp.“It shows the character of the team,” Solskjær said. “We were excellent, with fast football. That’s Manchester United. We’re trying to get back to that. Marcus has that strike in him. I’ve seen him in training so many times.”While United celebrated, Chelsea absorbed the disappointment of their seven-match winning run coming to an end. There was a callow feel to a side containing four teenagers, a lack of oomph waiting to be exploited, and United were quick to put themselves about.Fred had another good game in central midfield, Scott McTominay set the tone when he was booked for steaming into Mateo Kovacic early on and Lampard must have been alarmed when Harry Maguire won the ball off Marcos Alonso with a firm challenge before shrugging Christian Pulisic aside.United had disrupted Chelsea’s rhythm and were carrying the greater threat in attack. McTominay had gone close in the 13th minute, sweeping a shot just wide from Daniel James’s corner, and it summed up Chelsea’s unease when Alonso conceded the penalty that allowed the visitors to edge ahead midway through the first half.A fine run from James, who was always available to receive the ball on the right, created the danger. The winger’s pace carried him deep into Chelsea’s territory and he was entitled to go down after being bumped from behind by Alonso. Chelsea’s left-back could have no complaints when Paul Tierney penalised him, though at least United’s recent struggles from the spot gave the Spaniard hope of a reprieve.Yet Rashford, who had seen a penalty saved against Norwich on Sunday, kept his nerve. He had also missed one against Crystal Palace in August but there was no doubt in his mind here, only the composure to send Willy Caballero the wrong way and plant the ball into the opposite corner.Lampard was worried. He knew Chelsea’s passing had been slow. They did not manage a shot on target during the first half and Brandon Williams, United’s teenage wing-back, was coping well whenever Callum Hudson-Odoi ran at him on the right. Pulisic also found it hard to shake off Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the opposite flank.There were brighter signs from Chelsea at the start of the second half. Billy Gilmour, a slender 18-year-old, injected some urgency in midfield and Hudson-Odoi spurned two opportunities, scuffing wide after meeting Alonso’s low cross and firing over after latching on to a searching ball from Pulisic.An equaliser was on the way and it arrived when Caballero punted a clearance towards Batshuayi. The striker had spent most of the match being bullied by Maguire but this time he made the United centre-back look clumsy and slow, nodding the ball away from him, turning sharply and charging towards the area. Maguire’s lack of pace had been exposed and Batshuayi fired beyond Sergio Romero from 25 yards.Yet the last word went to United after Pedro, on as a late substitute, brought down Fred. Rashford stepped up and the best compliment that can be paid to him is that Cristiano Ronaldo would have been proud of what happened next.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c747dc784ef86901d5faf783904a4b25f26b42c/578_70_2884_1731/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=717f692124dbb02f44653a9cacf63c8d","title":"liverpool arsenal carabao cup match report","story":"There were more goals scored in normal time than in the penalty shootout and Liverpool advanced to a quarter-final their manager suggested they might never play. Yes, it was another of those ridiculous Anfield nights. It started with an own goal and finished with an 18-year-old from Liverpool, Curtis Jones, converting the decisive spot-kick in front of the Kop. The fulfilment of his dream was a nightmare for Arsenal.Unai Emery could point to Caoimhin Kelleher’s penalty save from Dani Ceballos in an otherwise flawless shootout as the fine margin that often separates teams at this level. It would not be entirely true. His team traded 10 goals with Liverpool, ranging from ugly to stunning and including everything in between. They traded dreadful mistakes and blows from beginning to end of an enthralling cup tie too. But only one side possessed the belief that the game is never over and it was not the team that led from the 26th minute until the 94th, that led 3-1, 4-2 and 5-4 in stoppage time. The faces in the Liverpool starting lineup had changed – all 11 of them from the win against Tottenham on Sunday in fact – but the strength of character to go to the last had not. Liverpool have a winner’s mentality throughout their squad. Arsenal lost theirs a long time ago.Divock Origi pegged back Arsenal for a fifth and final time with a flying volley from Neco Williams’ fine cross. Jones swept home Liverpool’s fifth and final penalty to secure a place in the last eight after James Milner, Adam Lallana, Rhian Brewster and Origi had scored past Emiliano Martinez. Héctor Bellerín, Mattéo Guendouzi, Gabriel Martinelli and Ainsley Maitland-Niles were also on target in the shootout for the visitors. Only Ceballos failed to beat Kelleher, Liverpool’s third choice, 20-year-old goalkeeper, and Klopp was left to savour not only the result but an experience for a team featuring five home debutants he could never have dreamt up in coaching school.“I don’t know when I had so much fun at a football game,” said the Liverpool manager, who threatened not to play the quarter-final that clashes with the Club World Cup in Qatar if “a proper date” is not found.Liverpool’s starting lineup had an average age of 23 years and 122 days and, despite a hugely encouraging start, a more experienced Arsenal team ruthlessly exploited the errors that crept into the home side’s display. Teenage summer signings Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg were among five Anfield debutants while the 18-year-old Williams impressed on his full Liverpool debut at right-back.Williams, a Wales under-19 international, played a fine pass behind Sead Kolasinac for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to cross towards Rhian Brewster at the near post. Shkodran Mustafi got there first yet conspired to miss the ball with his outstretched right leg and ert it past his own goalkeeper with his left knee.Arsenal, with Mesut Özil back in from the cold and floating to telling effect behind Martinelli, drew level from their first meaningful attack. Martinelli instigated the equaliser with a powerful surge down the left and low cross that eventually found its way to Bukayo Saka via Özil and Maitland‑Niles. Kelleher saved but Torreira snapped up the rebound from close range. VAR would have disallowed the goal for offside. Torreira revelled in its absence.The visitors overturned the deficit when Liverpool fell asleep at a free-kick. Torreira released Maitland-Niles down the right as home players stood watching and, from his second attempted cross, Van den Berg miscued towards his own goal. Kelleher saved but once again could only work the ball back into the danger zone and Martinelli converted into the roof of the net.Arsenal were clinical with their chances. Liverpool were supremely generous in offering them up and fell further behind when Elliott turned a Williams pass carelessly inside to Özil, who released Saka clear down the left with a fine first touch.The cross arrived low and perfectly for Martinelli to score his seventh goal in seven appearances with an emphatic shot over the exposed Kelleher. Emery’s team sensed daylight and welcome respite but the fun was only just beginning.Liverpool’s wayward passing and uncertain defending tested Anfield’s patience but they were offered a route back minutes before the interval when Elliott tumbled over Martinelli’s outstretched foot inside the Arsenal area. Andre Marriner had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, seconds after dismissing a penalty appeal for handball by Bellerín, and Milner sent Martínez the wrong way from 12 yards.Milner of all people was responsible for Arsenal regaining a two-goal advantage when his weak backpass was pounced upon by Maitland-Niles who, after an improvised flick from Özil, scored easily.Liverpool had it all to do once again. The comeback recommenced with a thumping 25-yard strike from Oxlade-Chamberlain, who found the top corner having beaten Maitland-Niles to a Lallana header.Parity was restored when Jones, a replacement for the injured Naby Keita, found Origi on the edge of the Arsenal area and the striker turned Rob Holding brilliantly before beating Martínez with a thunderous shot. And back came Arsenal.The tie was ridiculously open and so too was Liverpool’s midfield when Joe Willock breezed through and found the top corner from almost 30 yards. With seconds remaining the Arsenal defence switched off and Origi volleyed home Liverpool’s fifth. Klopp’s team, inevitably, held their nerve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f74d17fa563879fd9f9abb276b12b6a4ee31c5f/0_16_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=326998bbec087f9a64d967359ad9829a","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp carabao cup withdraw","story":"• Liverpool to play in Club World Cup during quarter-final week• ‘If they don’t find a proper date for us, we cannot play’Jürgen Klopp has threatened to withdraw Liverpool from the Carabao Cup should the EFL and Premier League fail to find what he considers “a proper date” for their quarter-final.Liverpool reached the last eight of the competition after a penalty shootout with Arsenal that followed a remarkable 5-5 draw at Anfield. The quarter-finals are scheduled for the week commencing 16 December – the same week the European champions will be in Qatar to play in Fifa’s Club World Cup tournament.The Premier League and Football League have been in talks with clubs over switching a potential quarter-final involving Liverpool to the week commencing 6 January, currently scheduled for the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg. Klopp insists Liverpool will not play any further part in the Carabao Cup should the eventual date complicate an already demanding workload.“They have to make that decision. You have to think about these things. If you have a fixture list where one team cannot be part of all the games, then you have to think about the fixture list. Hopefully it starts now. We will not be the victim of this problem. We play tonight, we wanted to win it, we did that, and if they don’t find a proper date, then we cannot play the next round and whoever is our opponent will go through. Or Arsenal play them. We are going to ignore that problem completely for tonight. A lot of people from the Premier League were sitting in front of the television hoping that Arsenal can do it. But – sorry!”Klopp’s main focus, however, was on the young players who guided Liverpool into the last eight despite trailing 3-1, 4-2 and, in stoppage time, 5-4 to Arsenal.Five youngsters made their Anfield debuts in the fourth-round tie and Klopp said: “You know, I just enjoyed it. I enjoyed each second of the game. I don’t know the last time I had so much fun in a football game. I saw so many really good performances. I was so happy for the kids that they will remember the first night for the rest of their lives. They made it a proper, special football night. Everyone who came tonight saw 19 goals – pretty special.“As a manager maybe I should worry more about the goals we conceded but I couldn’t care less to be honest. I could not care less. The mistakes that we made were obvious but it’s not important. The most important thing for development is that you react in the right way. All these boys need to play in difficult football games – and it was a difficult football game. They worked their socks off and left their souls on the pitch. I really loved it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/783587464cc6b32f9900e67fffe65c51b45ca0cd/48_0_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7156cbb7866f0f9b97d412510b77791","title":"counter strike trading found to be nearly all money laundering","story":"Valve says it has halted trading of some in-game items in multiplayer shooterThe gaming firm Valve has halted trading of some in-game items in its popular multiplayer shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive after discovering that “nearly all” of the trading was part of a money-laundering scheme run by “worldwide fraud networks”.In CS:GO, players can earn containers with cosmetic items, which can be unlocked using keys bought either in-game or for real money from other players.Valve said it had closed the market between players, and in patch notes for the latest version of CS:GO – first reported by Motherboard – it gave its reasons.“In the past, most key trades we observed were between legitimate customers. However, worldwide fraud networks have recently shifted to using CS:GO keys to liquidate their gains,” it said. “At this point, nearly all key purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be fraud-sourced. As a result we have decided that newly purchased keys will not be tradeable or marketable.”Valve did not go into detail, but it is likely the trading was used to launder income from credit card fraud and other financial crimes. Buying and reselling digital goods is a popular way for financial criminals to cash out from identity theft. In the past, iTunes and Amazon gift cards have also been popular.Counter-Strike has previously faced criticism from regulators for enabling gambling by children. In July the Gambling Commission’s programme director, Brad Enright, told MPs that CS:GO was responsible for more enquiries than any other game. “We’ve had dialogue with Valve Corporation,” Enright said. “Where we draw their attention to particular games where British consumers including children are gambling on those sites, they have closed them down.“We’ve said that’s not a sustainable approach. They’ve created this situation … and there’s an onus and responsibility on them to address the byproduct of how they’re operating.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d83d6a11c254b7a88c3d6a0844ab1c4e7e9d3b/0_214_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ced80a739757522d1c73c3a8b8477f","title":"mozhdah jamalzadah afghanistan oprah winfrey","story":"The presenter, pop star and women’s rights activist Mozhdah Jamalzadah talks about fleeing her country, before returning and revolutionising Afghan TVOne Friday, after the taping of her Afghan television chatshow, a woman from the studio audience came up to Mozhdah Jamalzadah to hug her. “She was so emotional and she wouldn’t let go,” says Jamalzadah. The woman said Jamalzadah’s programme, The Mozhdah Show, had stopped her husband beating their children, after it covered corporal punishment. “But from her face, I could tell that there was more to it,” says the 37-year-old. “I’m thinking that maybe he stopped beating her, too. That made me very emotional, and she just kept repeating: ‘We need you, Afghanistan needs you.’”Jamalzadah was five when her family escaped Afghanistan, eventually settling in Canada. In 2009, in her mid-20s, she returned to Kabul after being invited by a new TV station to host a talent show. She had started singing a few years earlier, posting music videos on YouTube one song, Afghan Girl, had become a hit in her homeland (she would be invited to perform it in 2010 at the White House to mark International Women’s Day in front of the Obamas).She and her mother, Nasrin, travelled to Kabul. But unbeknown to Jamalzadah, Nasrin had no intention of letting her daughter present a mere talent show. Instead she had packed several DVDs of The Oprah Winfrey Show – which they had been watching for years in Nasrin’s hair salon in Vancouver – and during their first meeting with TV executives, she pitched The Mozhdah Show. Not just a chatshow, either, but a vehicle, modelled on Oprah, to change the lives of Afghan women. The TV station went for it – and it ran from 2009 to 2011. For a country reeling from years of war, followed by the harsh Taliban rule, Jamalzadah became an image of what a modern Afghan woman could be – and there were many people in the country of her birth who didn’t like it.Jamalzadah speaks by Skype from Toronto, where she is promoting a film, Red Snow. In it, she plays the educated daughter of an Afghan family who help a First Nations Gwich’in soldier in the Canadian army, who is captured by the Taliban. A biography of Jamalzadah is also just about to be published. In the film, she wears a blue burqa – it’s the same garment Nasrin wore, hoping to pass as a peasant, when they fled Kabul about 30 years earlier, making a perilous journey to Pakistan. Her father, Bashir, had been a teacher when word got to him that he was about to be arrested because he was suspected of opposing the Soviet-backed government. The Jamalzadahs – Nasrin and Bashir, Mozhda and her two younger brothers, one of whom was only six months old – fled. “I was well aware that there was a major possibility we might not make it,” she says. “My heart would beat every time a soldier would hop up on the bus, and I would think: ‘I hope they don’t find out we’re city people.’”They were granted asylum in Canada and moved to Ontario. Jamalzadah remembers the cold, mostly, and, while she made good friends, she also experienced overt racism. Yet, she says: “At the same time, I knew we were safe, and I didn’t have to worry about whether my family were going to be OK. In Afghanistan I had rockets firing over my head and didn’t know where they were going to land. I would be out in the yard playing with my cousin, and you could hear the rockets. The racism and all the other stuff didn’t compare to trying to survive.”The family settled in Vancouver, where Bashir opened a pizza restaurant and Nasrin a hair salon. As a teenager, Jamalzadah became obsessed with reports about the war in Afghanistan, searching online and watching the news as soon as she was home from school. “I wanted to know how my family was, because there was no phone, no contact. I would think the worst when the bombings were happening, right after 911.”Her parents had urged her not to take opportunities and freedoms for granted, and she didn’t, but it also made her feel guilty that she was living such a different life to the friends she had left in Afghanistan. “My parents wanted me to use all of it fully so they were constantly reminding me how lucky I was. But, constantly being reminded, I was becoming more and more depressed. While all my other friends were talking about shopping and boys they had crushes on, secretly, this was my torment. I was constantly looking for ways to do something to help and speak up for those people.”She had been writing poetry and realised that while she could never remember the words of political speeches, she always remembered song lyrics. So one day she told her mother she’d like to find someone to turn her poems into songs. Nasrin encouraged her to have singing lessons with the Afghan-Canadian musician Wahid Omid. He uploaded one song to YouTube and it went viral.“I think people were hungry for something new, different. I was a girl and after the war there were hardly any female singers, especially ones who pranced around in the outfits I did.” The online attacks soon started, and Jamalzadah says she almost gave up, but she realised that was what the trolls wanted. Her next song, Dukhtare Afghan (Afghan Girl), written about an acid attack on girls going to school, was played on Afghan radio and became a hit, bringing her to the attention of TV executives.Being in Kabul, she says, “was magical. I mean, there’s barbed wire, dust everywhere, it’s a war zone, but I was totally OK with that because I was around Afghan people, and they seemed exactly the way that they were before. The love and the hospitality, and everything that Afghans stand for, was still there.”She laughs now too at how naive she was. Once she thought she heard a door slam and someone at her guesthouse told her it was a bomb. Another time, she thought she heard fireworks, only for the CEO of the TV station to shout at her not to leave the building: “You’re going to get hit by a bullet: do you not hear what’s going on out there?” “So it was comical, but very dark,” she says. In 2009: “There were times where everything felt like it was OK, other than the few suicide bombings here and there – everyone was just out and about, there were restaurants, everything was lively, and I loved it.”“That’s when we started receiving threats,” she says. Did she feel unsafe? “If I constantly lived in fear, it would stop me from doing anything, so I stopped myself from thinking about it.”She thinks her experience as a child, “not knowing if I’m going to live or not, affected me – it’s normal for me. I’d rather live a shorter life and have it be more impactful and live it to the fullest, then have a long one living in fear, afraid to go out and do something because I might get killed.”She was, she admits, protected to some degree by her Canadian citizenship. One girl, a contestant on a TV talent show, Afghan Star, that Jamalzadah presented from 2012 to 2013, told her: “If I had a foreign passport, I would dress like you. You can go back to Canada, but I can’t. I’m stuck here.” “She was right. I could see that in the way that I was treated. I’m sure that there were lots of people who would have liked to do all kinds of things but couldn’t get away with it. I think my fear was lessened because at any point, I could go to the Canadian embassy and be protected.”It couldn’t, however, protect her from a horrific attack by a man who she says assumed, because she was westernised, that she would be open to a sexual relationship. She alleges he lured her to an empty nightclub, then attacked her violently and she only got away after threatening him with a gun she kept in her bag. “The attack that happened to me happens to girls constantly, and there is nothing they can do. Even I couldn’t do anything,” she says. She wanted to report it, “but as a woman there, you’re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can’t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada. I can’t report it there, but I told my story.”In 2011, flying back to Kabul after a break in Canada, the Canadian embassy got in touch with her en route and told her there had been a serious threat, and that she should turn back. She ignored the warning, but in Kabul, her TV colleagues said the same thing and told her they were taking the show off-air.“It was devastating,” she says. “I felt defeated. When you’re on this high and think, ‘I’m making a difference’, then all of a sudden, all of that is shattered. I felt like a complete failure.”She returned to Canada wanting to give up. “I was like ‘it’s over. How stupid was I to think that I could make a difference?’ Then slowly I had to get myself out of that darkness and, and realise, no, I can’t let them defeat me.” She started thinking: “I could do so much more from here, and it doesn’t have to be The Mozhdah Show.”She has a strong social media presence in Afghanistan, where she is both supported and attacked for her posts. She sings in English, as well as in Farsi, and hopes to cross over to a bigger western audience. “I know it’s going to be a lot of work, but I have to do it. My goal is to be a women’s rights activist in the world,” she says. “I have to work to get myself to a position where I can speak for women who don’t have a voice, on a much bigger scale. That’s my goal now.”• Voice of Rebellion, the biography of Mozhdah Jamalzadah, is out on 7 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ee76c533e541ca8392075e12d69eacc76431b/0_989_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76564dff25e47c31ae127286903a357","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

The whole family has chosen to keep the diagnosis secret, lest the distress hasten Nai Nai’s demise.The central character, Billi, spends time with her ailing grandmother but it quickly becomes clear the trip nourishes something in the younger woman too. Billi leaves behind her empty city apartment, career disappointment and recent rejection from a prestigious fellowship program. With her grandmother she finds an intimate bond, a sense of identity rooted in cultures she has been dislocated from – both Chinese culture and the idiosyncratic, close culture of her family – as well as some perspective on her own existential malaise.“Life is not just about what you do,” Nai Nai tells Billi. “It’s more about how you do it.”The film is about immigration and identity, and has resonated strongly with Chinese-American and other diaspora communities, with layers of meaning white Australian viewers like myself could not fully understand.It is also a love story, about one of the lesser discussed but most meaningful relationships some of us are lucky enough to experience: the bond between an adult child and a loving grandparent.The importance of grandparents in the lives of young children is widely studied and intuitively understood: they can provide deep attachment bonds and safety. Practically, they are an increasingly critical source of unpaid childcare for working parents. While caring for small children can be taxing and imposing, studies suggest there can be real benefits for the grandparents too. The ABC’s recent hit series Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds chronicled the positive impacts infants had on their elderly companion’s lives and physical health.As adults, our relationships with our grandparents shift, and though we may no longer rely on them to look after us in a literal sense – and the caring dynamic may even reverse – it can be just as fulfilling.If you’re lucky, these relationships are rooted in unconditional love, acceptance and family ritual. With grandparents, there aren’t the complex intricacies of the relationship between a parent and “adult child” – the term is an oxymoron of course, but it’s an apt descriptor of who we become among our families. For some, grandparents might be bridges back to old countries, languages and cultures. For others, they can be a connection to a different time and way of life.I had a similar experience to Billi last year when I returned to Australia from New York. After three years, I’d said goodbye to a city, a partner, a journalism job, an apartment and my 20s. Unmoored and uncertain about what would come next, one of the first things I did was make the six-hour drive west, across the mountains and parched plains to spend a week with my 94-year-old grandmother, Gwynne, in her redbrick home in Dubbo.We had nothing and everything in common – she was raised on a farm to mainly Irish descendants, married at 19, had six children and never held a paying job – though she worked hard all her life. Family and community were her whole world – “my people”, she called them – and loving, human connection was everything. My late grandpa – from more stoic stock – used to joke drily my grandma would hug you goodbye if you went to the toilet.For a week we hung out. I would make her favourite dinners – sausages burnt black, served with tomato sauce and a glass of white wine with an ice cube – and we would watch TV together. She would roll her walker out under the shade of the big golden rain tree in her front yard to chat while I turned the hose on the red earth. We would have cups of tea in rooms cluttered with family photos and stacks of letters and old Christmas cards. She would run through the familiar repertoire of family legends with her gnarled hand on mine – her mother’s buggy accident, her rainy wedding day, the time my mum, then a toddler, handed her a live redback spider.I spent much of the time feeling stressed about my next career move. When I got a call offering me a phone interview for a new job, I reluctantly told her I would need a few hours alone with my laptop to prepare. Less than half an hour later, I could hear the wheels of her walker rolling into the kitchen. “Joey,” she said. “I don’t want to disturb you, but I’ve just got to read you this poem,” she said, holding up a tattered little book. She launched into Banjo Paterson’s A Bush Christening, only pausing to hoot between stanzas. I wanted to be annoyed but how could I be? She had never done a job interview in her life, and of course enjoying a poem together was more important.For people of my generation this is why these relationships can be so powerful. Our lives and identities are so deeply rooted in our work, in our digital lives, in often impermanent relationships and transient homes. Through our grandparents, we can access a different way of being in the world, a pre-neoliberal worldview, a different sense of belonging and identity. They gift us the wide sense of perspective that comes with age and witnessing the sweep of history.The Farewell has beautiful coda (spoiler alert – though it’s been widely discussed on the press tour). The real Nai Nai survived the cancer, in total ignorance, and is still alive today, years after the events depicted in the film took place. The title turns about to be something of a misnomer.Lulu Wang said in interviews that at every screening, people come up to her in tears to talk about their own grandmothers. “My goal is to leave people talking about the film, or talking about their own lives and their own family, or calling their grandma,” she said. “That’s my gift to the world. We should all call our grandmas more.”My trip was a farewell, of sorts, though I didn’t know it. Four months later, my grandmother had a stroke, which she would never fully recover from. The next time I drove out to Dubbo it was to put her in the red earth, to share stories and songs and poems from her life at her funeral, with my people.The final lesson these adult relationships with our grandparents teach us is the inevitability of loss. But through it we learn how we can become torch-bearers of histories, cultures and memories, if we choose to hold on to them. Even when they’re gone, they are lasting reminder: who we are is so much bigger than what we do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93480ef866e69649d6dd8b166ac6747716da0de7/187_99_1115_669/master/1115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6ff087774f0a7e6d80d4d82d0bf699","title":"bbc mounts defence in samira ahmed equal pay case","story":"Broadcaster has been speaking at an employment tribunal over claims of unequal payJeremy Vine was “gifted” his primetime Radio 2 show by BBC management and handed opportunities that were not available to ambitious female presenters, according to the broadcaster Samira Ahmed, who is suing the BBC for £693,245 in lost earnings over claims of unequal pay.Ahmed told an employment tribunal in central London that she had been consistently underpaid over six years for her work on BBC’s Newswatch programme compared with Vine, despite at one point the pair having similar public profiles. She also claims that when she raised salary concerns with management she was told by a senior BBC executive that “the BBC doesn’t do equal pay”.Ahmed said she had more input into writing her programme’s scripts than Vine and also highlighted the extra demands placed on female presenters: “It is likely that Jeremy Vine spends less time in make-up than I do. Women are more likely to be criticised for their appearance on air.”The broadcaster arrived at the central London tribunal to give evidence on Wednesday accompanied by supporters including fellow BBC presenters Jane Garvey, Richard Coles and Aasmah Mir, in the first major employment tribunal case since the corporation become embroiled in the gender pay row.Ahmed is bringing the case against the BBC on the basis that she was paid £440 an episode for presenting Newswatch since 2012, at a time when her male equivalent at the broadcaster, Vine, was paid £3,000 an episode for presenting Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output, with Ahmed claiming the pay difference is an example of gender discrimination.She said there was little logic to how the BBC paid its top talent: “It seems to me that men are more likely to be seen as stars, or at least stars that should be paid very highly. I don’t think it is clear what criteria the BBC use to decide whether someone is a star.”In supporting documents, she said she had been brought in to “transform the look and ambition” of Newswatch following the departure of its previous host Raymond Snoddy, but was kept on a similar salary.As part of her case, Ahmed’s team have said Newswatch attracts about 1.6 million combined viewers across the BBC News channel and BBC One – more than double that of Points of View.In response, the BBC has taken the unusual decision to play down the reach of its own output, saying its rolling news channel is a “relatively niche” service that airs little-watched programmes. It also said the only reason the corporation repeated the Newswatch programme on BBC One on a Saturday morning was to “fill out the programme at the weekend”, suggesting it was only watched because viewers had already turned on their TV in the hope of seeing BBC Breakfast.The BBC’s initial evidence at the tribunal claimed the two viewer feedback programmes were different shows for different audiences, which justified the different salaries paid to their presenters. The corporation claims Points of View is an entertainment show which has always attracted high-paid, high-profile presenters who have the skills to deal with a topic in a “light-hearted way”. By contrast, Newswatch is a “serious programme, which deals with matters seriously”, presented by a news journalist, which means it has always commanded a much lower salary.The broadcaster said Vine earned substantially more because of his star status across the broadcaster’s output, having negotiated a bumper pay contract in early 2008 when an unnamed commercial broadcaster was offering the Eggheads host a salary of about £1m to leave the BBC.Vine stopped presenting Points of View last year and was replaced by Tina Daheley, who receives £400 an episode for providing a voiceover. Ahmed will claim that the decision to cut the presenting fee for Points of View is related to her employment tribunal claim.However, the broadcaster has chosen to contest her claims over Newswatch, which could result in her winning more than half a million pounds in back pay.Equal pay is different to the wider issue of the gender pay gap. It covers specific cases where iniduals doing the same, or equivalent, work are paid less than their colleagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a03050098d6c4377239f446f238df0b980cbddd9/0_32_4044_2426/master/4044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ddb1d7dea55033e07fb3b60527776b","title":"damian carrington on 10 years as the guardians environment editor","story":"One of our leading environment journalists reflects on how awareness of the climate crisis has shifted in the last decade and offers advice for those who want to do moreWhat did you do before you joined the ?I did a PhD and post-doc research in geology at Edinburgh University, including an expedition to Antarctica, which was amazing: beautiful, pristine with bursts of life along the coast. But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3ac7fdaefce976a12774afec908ca0d6b681ff1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5e17422f1124791a5f6e1cb67a47b2","title":"amber rudd to step down as mp","story":"Culture secretary and former home secretary join swathe of moderate Tories not standingThe culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, and the former home secretary Amber Rudd are among a number of Conservative moderates who have announced they will not stand again at the upcoming 12 December election.Morgan announced the news on Twitter, accompanied by a letter in which she cited “the clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP” as part of the reason for her decision.Rudd has been embroiled in a highly public spat with Downing Street over her departure, with the party banning her from standing again for the Conservatives and then Rudd responding that Boris Johnson had offered her a safe seat only last week.She and Morgan are two of a number of senior Tory moderates who are not standing again at this election, including Ken Clarke, Alistair Burt, Claire Perry and the prime minister’s brother, Jo Johnson. They were joined on Wednesday by David Lidington, a leading moderate and Theresa May’s former de facto deputy, who also said he would quit at the coming election.In a letter to his local newspaper, the Bucks Herald, the Aylesbury MP wrote: “I have come to the conclusion that now is the right time for me to give a higher priority in terms of my time and energy, to … my family.”Many of the MPs leaving the Conservatives are female.

Good luck to colleagues in forthcoming GE.”Announcing her departure, Rudd said she had hoped to rejoin the party ranks but was rebuffed by Mark Spencer, the chief whip, whose cutting letter to her was made public.In surrendering the whip, Spencer wrote, Rudd had made it clear that she “did not support the approach of the prime minister and did not have confidence in him”.“You have failed to provide me with assurances that you will not change your mind once more,” he continued.Having the party whip was “an honour, not a right, and as such it cannot be discarded or returned at will if it is to have any meaning”, Spencer said in the letter. In response, Rudd tweeted that Johnson had asked her to stand in the election as a Tory only last week, potentially in the safe seat of Mid Sussex being vacated by Sir Nicholas Soames.When she left the cabinet earlier this autumn in solidarity with Tory MPs who had the whip removed for opposing hard Brexit, Rudd condemned Johnson’s use of words such as “surrender” and “betrayal” over Brexit, warning it could incite violence against opponents.Rudd became an MP in 2010 and climbed the junior ministerial ranks before replacing Theresa May as home secretary in 2016, when May entered Downing Street. However, she was forced to resign two years later after failing to properly account for her role in the Windrush scandal about the treatment of Caribbean Britons.She returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary later the same year, but after Johnson replaced May she appeared increasingly uncomfortable with what she said was his pursuit of a no-deal Brexit.On Tuesday, 10 of 21 other Conservative MPs who were stripped of the whip for supporting a backbench-instigated bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit were readmitted to the party.But the others remained out in the cold indicating they will not be able to stand for the party, including Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, David Gauke, the former justice secretary, Oliver Letwin, former Cabinet Office minister, and Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general.More than 50 MPs have so far announced they will stand down at the election, already well above the 31 who did not stand again in 2017. These were both two-year parliaments.They included Stockport MP Ann Coffey, who announced she would not be standing again. The former Labour MP, who resigned from the party earlier this year and went on to help form Change UK, revealed her decision in a video to constituents on Twitter.More MPs have stood down before other elections, with 90 not standing again in 2015, and 149 in 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6cf184a4d8fd1469b506eb1d526026d678726c/776_116_4656_2793/master/4656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e60ee34a99675707e25d49624f311e6","title":"five factors that could be decisive to general election outcome","story":"Key questions that need to be answered in the run-up to voting on 12 DecemberWith Brexit still unresolved, and smaller parties hoping to break through, pollsters and pundits have warned that this general election is the most unpredictable in decades. Here are five factors that could make the difference:1) Is it all about Brexit?Labour has settled its Brexit policy, and will hope to stand out as the one party offering to “let the people decide” by offering a referendum within six months of taking office.But Jeremy Corbyn knows that will not be enough for many ardent remainers in his own party, and among its voters, who believe, as his deputy Tom Watson put it in a speech earlier this year, “our members are remain, our values are remain, our hearts are remain”.If remain voters feel more motivated by stopping Brexit than any other issue, they may feel tempted to opt for Jo Swinson’s “bollocks to Brexit” Liberal Democrats.Corbyn will therefore hope to recast the campaign away from Brexit, towards Labour’s “transformative” domestic agenda, including wholesale renationalisation, radical labour market reforms and a dramatic increase in public investment.2) Is the big squeeze on, or can smaller parties flourish?In 2017, the Lib Dems had hoped to rally disgruntled remainers to their cause – and the party’s then leader Tim Farron even suggested they could “do a Trudeau”, and overhaul the official opposition.But as the gruelling seven-week campaign went on, Farron got tangled up in questions of sin and sexuality while voters appeared to have decided their choice was about which party would be in government – and that meant Labour or the Tories.Swinson is already pressing to be included in TV debates as she attempts to break in on that duopoly, and her supporters hope the electorate will warm to her.And Boris Johnson’s fate will also depend on how successful the Brexit party can be in scooping up disgruntled leavers – and how aggressive its leader, Nigel Farage, will be in pursuing the PM for failing to meet his “do or die” pledge of leaving on 31 October.3) How will the leaders perform on the campaign trail?Corbyn’s uplifting rallies and Theresa May’s stilted stump speeches helped turn around voters’ perceptions of the two leaders in 2017.Johnson’s team, many of whom are Vote Leave veterans, are convinced he can recapture the rough-and-tumble of the 2016 referendum campaign, which saw him outshine David Cameron.But he has sometimes appeared chaotic or undisciplined during public appearances since becoming PM – and campaigns can be unpredictable.For Labour, meanwhile, it may be hard for Corbyn to recapture the freshness of 2017, when he was barely known to many voters, and before he became sucked into the mire of Brexit in parliament.And while his poll ratings as a leader were poor back then – and improved during the campaign – they are now even worse. Ipsos Mori says he has the lowest leadership satisfaction rating for any opposition leader since 1977.4) Can Johnson do better than May at winning over Labour voters?May’s ill-fated manifesto launch in 2017 was held in Halifax – one of a swath of Labour seats across the Midlands and the north-east they hoped to take.In the event, May’s “strong and stable” slogan was much less successful than her boosters hoped at winning over former Labour voters: aside from a handful of seats, including Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, and Mansfield.However, Labour majorities were squeezed in many Brexit-voting former industrial areas, such as Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield seat, and Paul Farrelly’s in Newcastle-under-Lyme. (Both are standing down).This time around, the Conservatives have discarded the austerity policies that have characterised their last nine years in power – and will have a manifesto aimed squarely at working-class, former Labour voters.Johnson has been visiting a hospital or a school almost every day in recent weeks and Tory strategists hope Priti Patel’s tough stance on law and order will help them to exploit what they regard as a weak spot for Labour, and for Corbyn in particular.Patel, the home secretary, said at last month’s Tory conference that her party’s message to criminals was “we are coming after you” – and senior party figures were keen to tell stories of the warm welcome they were receiving on the doorsteps in Tory heartlands.Corbyn’s fancy footwork on Brexit is partly about allowing Labour to have an offer to make to voters in seats like these – and the party also has a list of snappy retail policies, including free prescriptions and funded social care. But Johnson’s allies believe he can cut a swath through the Midlands and the north-east.5) Where do Tory remainers go?The departure of a string of high-profile moderates from the parliamentary Conservative party has underlined its rapid transformation in just months, during Johnson’s premiership.Some, including Amber Rudd and Oliver Letwin, have had the whip removed, while others, including David Lidington, have announced in recent days that they are quitting parliament.Several have voiced fears that traditional Tory voters in constituencies like theirs will have nowhere to go. Former justice secretary David Gauke, who represents South West Hertfordshire, suggested what he called Johnson’s “Farage-lite” strategy could cost his party millions of votes.Will the fear of a leftwing Corbyn government sting longtime Conservative voters into returning to the fold? Or will they be disillusioned enough to find a home elsewhere – perhaps most likely with the Lib Dems.Swinson told St Albans MP Anne Main – a leaver representing a remain seat – that she had already visited her constituency, and hoped to do so many more times in the weeks ahead.Many of these commuter-belt seats will be high on the Lib Dems’ target list – and the more of them Johnson loses, the more ground he needs to make up elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5a1e82c0b5c5801be846d20bb51b31a5382b2cd/0_206_7005_4203/master/7005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12d6ef0c4e73d7e4de4ff382ffd92c37","title":"liberal democrats face being frozen out of live tv debates general election","story":"Labour and Tories prefer one-on-one format, which would mean no place for Jo Swinson’s partyThe Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, faces being cut out of televised leadership debates during the general election campaign, as broadcasters begin torturous negotiations over who gets to show the nation’s political leaders arguing with each other on stage.While the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Sky News are all vying for the position, Swinson’s place in any forthcoming debate is less than assured. The Tories are thought to prefer simple one-on-one debates between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in a bid to reduce the election to a simple choice between the two. Labour have adopted a similar stance amid fears they could lose pro-remain votes to the Lib Dems due to the party’s pledge to revoke Brexit.Corbyn’s spokesman said the Labour leader was committed to holding head to head debates with Johnson, with no mention of the Lib Dems. “There are only two possible people who can be prime minister at the end of this election campaign, and those two people should have a head-to-head debate,” he said.Earlier in the Commons, Johnson dodged a question from Swinson when she challenged him to a three-way-debate. “What the people of this country want is their promises kept,” he said in response.Channel 4 has already proposed a simple head-to-head leadership format involving only Johnson and Corbyn, according to a source at the broadcaster, while other channels are currently refining their plans. Smaller parties, including the Scottish National party, the Greens, and the Brexit party are also likely to demand the right to take part – especially in any programme on the publicly funded BBC.While US presidential elections have an independent organisation to agree on debate format, in the UK it comes down to bargaining with political parties by television executives. According to iniduals involved in previous negotiations, the incumbent prime minister has the most power over the format of the debate, in part because channel bosses want to ensure they have the “main attraction” before ripping up the schedule and cancelling peak-time programmes that could attract higher audiences.One major concern for political campaigns is that televised debates are seen as increasingly risky, since short video clips from a debate go viral and reach a far larger audience on social media.The broadcasters could also struggle given the relatively short election campaign of just six weeks until 12 December, which gives political parties the ability to say they only have time for a handful of head-to-head televised events. Leadership debates have a reputation for sucking up days of campaign time as candidates have to be prepared and tested. Parties are also likely to emphasise the declining audiences for television – 3.5m viewers tuned in for the 2017 BBC leadership debate - and suggest they would prefer to put their efforts into digital campaigning.There is also the precedent set by Johnson’s team during his party leadership campaign. They ignored Channel 4’s leadership debate completely and let their candidate be represented by an empty chair. Instead, Johnson took part in a chaotic BBC debate involving five rivals and a single head-to-head on ITV with Jeremy Hunt, shrugging off claims he was avoiding scrutiny.Ever since British broadcasters convinced the UK’s major political parties to take part in live televised leadership debates for the first time in 2010, political parties have been trying to avoid them or shape the format to their advantage. Former Conservative strategist Sir Lynton Crosby blamed David Cameron’s decision to take part in the debates for costing him a majority, after the then Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was briefly elevated to the top of the polls.In 2015 the Conservatives spent months wrangling with broadcasters over whether minor parties such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru should be included on stage, while in the 2017 general election the Tories decided to keep Theresa May out of the televised debates altogether – only for her to be widely mocked for her absence, in a symbolic representation of her collapsing campaign.The often farcical debates reached a new high at the end of last year, during a lengthy back-and-forth involving May and Corbyn and an attempt to hold a public debate over Brexit. This saw both BBC and ITV pledge to hold their own head-to-head programme featuring the two leaders in the same Sunday evening time slot, despite the physical impossibility of both politicians being in two television studios at the same time. In the end neither event went ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63755644f5abb9e7c3ef9a5dd2a47b03865c58e1/0_137_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3792674e8505c9e19f882d620a4b4ea","title":"tactical voting could deliver remain victory in election study","story":"Best for Britain website suggests backing Lib Dems in Labour-held marginalsA new tactical voting website has been criticised for advising pro-remain voters to back the Liberal Democrats in some seats where the party is way behind Labour, including key knife-edge marginals against the Conservatives.The website, launched by the pro-remain Best for Britain organisation, suggested that voters should back the Lib Dems in Kensington, where the Labour MP Emma Dent Coad has a majority of just 20 against her Tory opponent.The Lib Dems received just 4,724 votes there in 2017 compared with 16,313 for the Tories and 16,333 for Labour.Likewise in Cities of London and Westminster, the website recommends voting Lib Dem, where the candidate got just 4,270 in 2017, compared with 18,005 for the successful Tory incumbent and 14,857 for Labour.Both seats have high-profile Lib Dem defectors standing, with former Tory Sam Gyimah in Kensington and former Labour MP Chuka Umunna in Cities of London and Westminster.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.Tests of the website suggested there were many examples of advice to vote Lib Dem in seats where there was little hope of victory and a vote for Jo Swinson’s party would be likely to lead to a win for the Tories. A senior Labour party source said: “The only person who benefits from this bogus advice is Boris Johnson and the vested interests he protects. This false information makes Johnson’s sell-out Brexit deal more likely and its peddlers should be ashamed of themselves. A vote for the Lib Dems in almost every seat in the country helps put Johnson in Downing Street.”Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, defended the voting guide. “Our tool uses MRP analysis, which is the only model that correctly predicted the shock wins for Labour in 2017, like Canterbury and Kensington,” she said.Earlier, Best for Britain launched new research suggesting that tactical voting could swing a victory for pro-remain parties in the December election.Its analysis found that Johnson would fail to get a majority if one in three pro-remain voters in England and Wales switched their vote.In this scenario, the Conservatives would win 309 seats, Labour 233, the Liberal Democrats 34, Plaid Cymru four and the Greens one. When the Scottish National party, Democratic Unionist party and the Commons Speaker are factored in, this would give pro-remain parties a slim majority.Smith said: “If we vote tactically we can stop a Boris Johnson majority and return a parliament that much more accurately reflects the state of the country’s views on the issue of Europe, which is now a majority pro-European country and we need a majority pro-European parliament.Best for Britain’s assessment was done on a seat-by-seat analysis with a poll of 46,000 British people in September and October. Without any tactical voting, the Tories would win a majority of 44, taking 364 seats to Labour’s 189, it said.There are concerns that the remain vote is split across five political parties, including Labour, while the leave vote is split between the Tories and Brexit party.Lewis Baston, an election expert, said at a launch event for the study in Westminster that in the current climate casting an “effective vote” was “all the more important because the remain tribe is more ided than the leave tribe”.Baston said the elections in 2015 and 2017 were hard to predict because of the number of people switching parties, and he expected the same to be true in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0489ae55b0b0869643bdbec5a31a17baa53a70d4/0_205_5569_3342/master/5569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=416188c1d7f927eee758c77cc2366686","title":"tory party suspends candidate accused sabotaging trial","story":"PM had been urged to act over Ross England, who is standing for election to Welsh assemblyA Conservative candidate for the Welsh assembly who was accused by a judge of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been suspended by his party after Boris Johnson was pressed in the House of Commons to take action.Ross England was giving evidence in the trial last year when he made claims about the victim’s sexual history.The trial judge, Stephen Hopkins, told him: “You have managed, singlehandedly, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trial.“Mr England, as far as I am concerned, this matter so far as you are concerned isn’t ended. I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.”The issue was raised during prime minister’s questions in the Commons on Wednesday where the Labour MP Jo Stevens asked if the prime minister was going to sack England.Johnson replied: “It would be inappropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” However, legal proceedings have concluded in the case.A statement was issued on Wednesday evening in the name of the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Lord Davies of Gower, who said: “Ross England has been suspended pending this matter being presented to the candidates committee.”England had been endorsed for his candidature by his former employer, Alun Cairns, the secretary of state for Wales.Stevens, who is the MP for Cardiff Central, said it was disgraceful that Johnson had refused to answer her question about England.She said: “I made clear the case had finished. The PM could and should have answered me. Both he, and the secretary of state who endorsed this inidual as a candidate, have serious questions to answer about why this man is a Tory candidate.”The defendant in the rape trial, James Hackett, who is reportedly a friend of England, was subsequently convicted of rape in a fresh trial.The victim denied the claims made by Ross during the trial in 2018 and has told the BBC that England’s selection by the Welsh Conservatives “shows how little respect they have for me”.Gwendolyn Sterk, a spokesperson for Welsh Women’s Aid, said: “We find it significantly worrying that any party should select a candidate that has been deemed by a judge to have deliberately undermined a rape trial and caused further trauma to a survivor.”Cairns was asked by the  if he was aware of the comments made by the judge when he endorsed England.A spokesperson for Cairns said: “Mr Cairns received no communication at any point from the court regarding this case. This is a matter for the inidual as he was not employed by Mr Cairns at the point of case collapse or at his subsequent selection.”Eljai Morais, the Women’s Equality party’s general election candidate in Dover, said: “Disdain for women is fast becoming the criteria for being a Conservative party candidate.“Boris Johnson’s lack of concern over fielding a candidate who deliberately sabotaged a rape trial is shocking but hardly surprising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d836fadae716baae9169c0bdff2b94e1e7dadd2/0_62_5540_3324/master/5540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd01c2ddd34b25f28bf218ff4687e7d9","title":"jewish group removes campaigning support for labour in election","story":"JLM says party’s handling of antisemitism cases means only ‘exceptional candidates’ will be backedThe Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) has withdrawn campaigning support for Labour in the upcoming general election in protest at its handling of antisemitism cases.As one of the oldest socialist societies affiliated to Labour, the group regularly sent out activists to support candidates across the country before voters went to the polls.However, for what is believed to be the first time in its 100-year history, it will not organise members to head out to constituencies and instead only support “exceptional candidates”, such as its parliamentary chair, Ruth Smeeth, and other MPs it views as having been supportive.A statement released by the organisation said: “We will not be campaigning unless in exceptional circumstances and for exceptional candidates, like our parliamentary chair Ruth Smeeth, and members of the parliamentary Labour party who’ve been unwavering in their support of us. We will not be giving endorsements to candidates in non-Labour-held seats.”JLM credits its campaigning work as securing Labour wins in Bury South in 2017 and 2015, Leeds North West in 2017, holding Hampstead and Kilburn in 2015 and winning Hornsey back in 2015 from the Liberal Democrat minister Lynne Featherstone.The organisation, which has 2,500 members, blames the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for allowing a “culture of antisemitism to emerge and fester” within the party.The JLM’s stand comes after the organisation’s honorary president, Dame Louise Ellman, along with the former parliamentary chair, Luciana Berger, left the party citing antisemitic abuse and bullying.Its statement added: “When two accomplished and dedicated Jewish Labour MPs no longer see a place for themselves in the Labour party, it’s clear that the party has lost its way.”It said the effective strike does not mean the group no longer supports Labour’s policies and historic values, or that they want to see Boris Johnson or the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, as prime minister.“The Jewish Labour Movement has a long and proud history of activism in the Labour party and the wider Labour movement and 2020 marks our 100th anniversary of affiliation to the Labour party,” it said.“This crisis of antisemitism in the Labour party stems from a failure of leadership from Jeremy Corbyn. When the answer has been to take swift, decisive action, the reality has been equivocation and token gestures.”At JLM’s annual general meeting in April, its members unanimously adopted a policy that declared Corbyn to be “unfit to be prime minister”. There had been a discussion about disaffiliation but this was voted down in meetings held in London and Manchester.Labour has said it is taking decisive and robust action against antisemitism and Corbyn has said it has no place in society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f628e6df708e96eba9819a2c02837bfb6298ce/3180_722_1829_1097/master/1829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332bec3bb019118ed9f4b08e092c526b","title":"chris packham i wanted to know how my parents lives were shaped","story":"In a bid to help TV presenter Chris Packham understand more about his heritage,  Sue George went on a mission to see how much she could discover about his ancestors in just a weekBoats have always been around me,” says conservationist, campaigner and TV presenter Chris Packham, who leads a hugely busy life filming and writing about the natural world. “My father was a marine engineer, but port employment or work within the merchant navy didn’t appeal to me.”Born in Southampton, where his parents met and married, Packham’s main interest in finding out more about his family tree was to discover what had shaped his background.“I understand the contribution my parents made but, further back, I want to know how their lives were shaped and influenced by others.“I am a realist and pragmatist,” he says. “Context is everything and not all is happy-jolly.”This is evident in the life of his mother, Rita, who died in 2011 Packham knew very little about her side of the family, but Ancestry was on hand to provide further details about his background. Anyone who wants to discover new and interesting information about their families can type in their own name and details Ancestry will offer you hints about where to search next.Documents kept by the family showed that Rita’s 13-year-old brother had been injured in that air raid and had spent six weeks in hospital. The raid took place on 1 December 1940 – the final night of the Southampton blitz. There was more information about the raid on Ancestry. Packham had not known that his maternal grandmother, Gertie Kinnard, not only had to suffer the worry of her son being in hospital, but that her 71-year-old father, Alfred, had been wounded in the attack too. He died of his wounds a month later.“That’s a degree of trauma that would be difficult to imagine,” Packham says.Although Packham remembers his mother’s mother, he didn’t know anything about Gertie’s ancestors. It turns out that the men on the Kinnard side of the family were also connected to both seafaring and Southampton. His three-times great-grandfather, David Kinnard (1804-1883), lived in Sussex but his son, also called David (1833-1894), went to work in the Southampton docks during the 1860s.Records showed that the younger David’s sons followed him into the maritime industries. These men – Frederick, Harry, Frank, Thomas and Alfred – started their working lives in jobs related to seafaring. Frank became an apprentice sail maker, while the other three ran errands around the docks. They later joined the merchant navy or worked in ship repair.One image uploaded to Ancestry tells another sad tale: a photograph of a gravestone in Southampton. David Kinnard and his wife, Emma, were buried there, as was Alfred in 1941. But the first person whose details were inscribed was David and Emma’s son, Packham’s great-great-uncle, Harry. Harry died in 1889, aged 19, on his “first voyage at sea”.Another sea tragedy that was already well known to the family concerns his paternal grandfather, Harold Packham. He joined his first ship, the SS Moliere, at the age of 17, in 1921, in the role of “wireless watcher”, or operator. The boat took three months to travel from Barry, in Wales, to California via the Panama canal and back again, carrying cargoes of fruit and salmon. Later, Harold moved to Southampton and worked crewing yachts, at one point going to the remote Cocos Islands with the racing driver and treasure-hunter Malcolm Campbell.In 1933, when Packham’s father, Colin, was a baby, Harold died. He had been on a steamer that foundered off the coast of Aldeburgh, Suffok, leading to the death of all on board. The ship was carrying coal from Blyth, near Newcastle, to Kent. While evidence from inspectors and past crew members indicated the ship had been unfit to sail – there was a Board of Trade inquiry, and the matter was even raised in parliament – the sinking was ruled as “death by misadventure”.In spite of his family background, Packham considers how he “bucked the trend” of the employment taken by many of his relatives.“That’s probably because, being born in 1961, I had an education available to me that none of them would have had.“People of our generation have seen technological and scientific breakthroughs, but we are now conscious of what they have cost us. Ours will be a very interesting generation to look back on,” he says.Uncover your story. Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

Eddie Jones’s side lock horns with South Africa in Saturday’s final and the hooker Jamie George has been seeking advice from Eoin Morgan.George has spoken to the England one‑day captain on numerous occasions and believes England can learn from the cricketers’ dramatic super-over victory against New Zealand in July. George also sees similarities between the teams in that both endured calamitous World Cup campaigns in 2015. Much like the cricketers, George also revealed that England have been conducting clear‑the-air meetings, with the coaches banned from attending and the captain, Owen Farrell, delivering inspirational messages.George is also close to the England cricketer Sam Billings, who missed the World Cup through injury but is now on tour in New Zealand. The pair went to school together and George said: “The video came out of us watching their World Cup final and, chatting to him, they will probably be sat around watching ours as well. It’s quite a cool thought.”England go into the final in Yokohama as favourites having moved to No 1 in the world rankings for the first time since 2004 with their imperious win over the All Blacks. Morgan and co were also widely tipped to lift the World Cup trophy before their final against New Zealand but the nature of their dramatic victory has served as a warning to George.“A big thing that I have thought about is your ability to perform your skills under the highest pressure,” he said. “If you think back to that super over and the last run-out – Jason Roy’s throw – he had to pick the ball up first, the ball is coming to him at speed, he’s done it a thousand times before but doing it under that pressure knowing he needs to get it there in that moment. Things like that. Doing your job under pressure. I read that all Jason Roy could think about was getting the ball into his hands. He was thinking about the process rather than thinking about the big picture.”George said Farrell will host another of his captain’s meetings on Friday night and deliver one last call to arms. The togetherness of England’s squad was tested during their World Cup training camps when an altercation between Ben Te’o and Mike Brown led to both being jettisoned by Jones in August. George, however, has praised Farrell’s meetings as a way of uniting the squad.“Everyone is hanging on every word he says,” George said. “It is very inspirational without tearing the roof down because that is probably not what is needed. He has a very good feel of what the team needs and what messages he needs to deliver. There are no coaches in the room. He just asks us how we are feeling and if anyone has anything to say. Often people will get something off their chest if they are thinking about the game and then he says his bit and without fail you could hear a pin drop.“As a leader I can’t speak highly enough of him. He is the sort of person you want to follow. He leads from the front but at the same time you know for a fact the messages he is giving you he has been thinking over and over again. He is very good at delivering a theme and messages that build up nicely throughout the week.“Owen talks a lot about how the buildup starts through the week but it also starts from the minute you wake up on the Saturday – the image you give off to the people around you, even in the way you walk to breakfast. You are always constantly giving off a message to other people about your mindset and how you are feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d20c8f92737e5e0d135a20e520707ee3d41f7a5/142_82_4284_2571/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=072094e0b3d4bfafbf2182022e536411","title":"eoin morgan backs england rookies t20 new zealand cricket","story":"Three months on from the heart-stopping super-over finish to the World Cup at Lord’s, England and New Zealand will be reunited for the start of a five-match Twenty20 series amid the more sedate surroundings of the picturesque Hagley Oval.Friday’s opener in Christchurch could scarcely be further from that famous day by way of distance, magnitude or personnel. Kane Williamson, so gracious after his Black Caps side were denied by the barest of margins, is lying low until the Tests due to a longstanding hip issue, while the tourists have rested a raft of senior players.Though symptomatic of the modern schedule, it means plenty of fresh English faces to take in. As well as being a first assignment for Chris Silverwood as head coach, the squad features six uncapped rookies – Tom Banton, Saqib Mahmood, Lewis Gregory, Pat Brown, Sam Curran and Matt Parkinson – and a host of past fringe players – Dawid Malan, Sam Billings, James Vince and Joe Denly – all out to impress.Eoin Morgan, the white-ball captain, insisted his first team will be tough to crack once the likes of Jason Roy, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer and Moeen Ali return (Joe Root feels less of a certainty). But with T20 World Cups in Australia and India in the next two years, there is a desire to widen the pool of players.Morgan himself needed the summer of all summers to end before he could fully process what had transpired and assess his occasionally angry lower back before deciding to continue as captain. The result is another 12 months at the very least, even if the 33-year-old is telling himself to look further.He said: “We have a special group of players at the moment. I feel very lucky to lead and I think we can do something even more special down the line. I won’t say I’ll be finished after the next T20 World Cup as I’d be afraid I’ll only creep over the line and maybe tail off. I don’t want to let anyone down. I want to drive through to Australia and then make a call after that.”Such clarity of thought is typical of Morgan, so too the appraisal of his new partnership with Silverwood. Root’s Test team may require some fresh leadership from the head coach but for limited-overs cricket it is very much a case of putting the support into the term “support staff”.Morgan said: “It’s been seamless. We have a lot of leaders in the group and they drive the intensity of practice. They are very demanding in terms of what they want from the coaches. So facilitating that and coming back with stuff that’s challenging is important. Silvers is the man to do that.”England go into the opener after a win and a defeat in the warm-ups, with Morgan describing the latter, inflicted by a century from Colin Munro, as the more instructive for the newcomers. Jonny Bairstow – one of only three English survivors from the World Cup final along with Morgan and Adil Rashid, and fresh from an unbeaten 78 in the first outing – is clearly one to watch too after being left out of the Tests that follow.Should there be a tie over the course of the next five matches, a super over will follow. But unlike on 14 July, these will keep being played until an outright winner emerges, rather than reverting to boundaries struck. How New Zealand, currently cracking wry jokes about a run of English sporting success after last Saturday’s rugby union semi-final defeat for the All Blacks, must wish this change had come earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe9485ab2e88b575fec1b3fb24a5cfa2d325a7b/0_255_4321_2593/master/4321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d876d3731839d1b7d9a2cff5f7cc52b","title":"washington nationals world series houston astros","story":"It was a pitching duel worthy of deciding the destiny of the World Series: Zack Greinke v Max Scherzer in a battle of two aging aces. Yet in the end, the key struggle might have been internal, Scherzer’s spirit in defiance of a sore body that threatened to betray him.The 35-year-old woke up on Sunday with neck spasms that left him unable to move his right arm, get out of bed or get dressed by himself. He flew to Texas on Monday wearing a neck brace. A couple of days, a cortisone shot and some chiropractic treatment later, he pronounced himself fit and ready, pitched in the decisive game of the World Series and gave up only two runs in five often-agonizing innings: a home run from Yuli Gurriel and an RBI single from Carlos Correa.That narrow margin proved vital when the contest turned on its head in the seventh inning, as the Washington Nationals scored three times to storm into the lead, spoil Greinke’s stellar performance and deliver the first World Series title either before or since the Nationals franchise emigrated from Montreal in 2005. It is the city’s first since the Senators beat the New York Giants in 1924.While Greinke cantered through the first six innings, showcasing his fielding skills as well as his finesse, Scherzer was doughty but dodgy over his 103-pitch outing, allowing seven hits. Clearly below his best, he was also playing without his catcher of choice, the injured Kurt Suzuki.The Astros, who led the majors with 107 wins during the regular season, were undeniably wasteful, stranding 10 runners on base, especially when they had excellent chances to build a big lead. But Scherzer’s stubborn refusal to yield despite his suspect pitch control, doing just enough to keep the deficit down and burnish hopes of a comeback, was emblematic of a Washington team that has proved inspired by adversity.After all, they saw their superstar slugger, Bryce Harper, leave for Philadelphia in free agency in March had won only 19 games and lost 31 at the end of May were on the brink of elimination against the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild-card round and carved out an improbable 3-2 series win over the fancied Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series before easing past the St Louis Cardinals in the NLCS.Stephen Strasburg became the first No 1 overall draft pick to be named Most Valuable Player of the World Series after earning victories in each of his two starts, surrendering a combined four runs over 14 and one third innings. But while this series generally lacked classic encounters – six of the games were won by wide margins – and was pockmarked by some of the worst umpiring since Leslie Nielsen portrayed Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun – it was abundantly weird.The Astros, who won their first Fall Classic two years ago, were overwhelming favorites entering this series, especially with four games at Minute Maid Park, where they owned the best home record in baseball. This, though, was the series that popularized the concept of home disadvantage. Never before had the visiting team won the first six, let alone seven, games in a World Series – and that goes for the best-of-seven postseason series in the NBA and the NHL, too.Wednesday’s match-up was also the first Game 7 in World Series history to pit two former Cy Young winners against each other. Greinke, 36, was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks in a trade in July as the Astros revisited their splashy strategy from two years earlier, when they made a last-gasp trade for Justin Verlander, another veteran ace pitcher, and won their first World Series, sparking joyous scenes in a city that had been devastated by Hurricane Harvey only a few weeks earlier.But would they get the Greinke who gave up one run in four and two thirds innings in Game 3 last week, or the Greinke who allowed six runs in three and two thirds innings against Tampa Bay in the American League Division Series? On Wednesday he was brilliant … until he wasn’t.Anthony Rendon, the Nationals’ outstanding third baseman (who was born in the Houston area) punished a rare Greinke mistake with a solo home run in the seventh inning. Greinke, suddenly touchable, then walked Juan Soto, the 21-year-old slugging starlet, and AJ Hinch, the Astros manager, brought down the curtain after 80 pitches. It was a fateful decision.Barely had the crowd sat down after affording Greinke a standing ovation when Will Harris relieved him and 36-year-old Howie Kendrick – who had shocked the Dodgers with a 10th-inning grand slam - pinged a two-run home run off the right-field foul pole. The atmosphere inside Minute Maid Park, so boisterous and confident a few moments earlier, turned queasy. The Astros players looked ashen-faced.Houston’s bullpen misery deepened when a Soto single added a run, scoring Adam Eaton, and continued as Washington plated two more runs in the ninth inning.The Astros’ smooth progress had been snapped with sudden brutality. They were finished, and Scherzer, whose night had seemed likely to be remembered as an exercise in heroic failure, was a World Series champion, dancing with his ecstatic teammates as they sprinted on to the infield after the final out, all the pain forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a2aa1ef4becdf5915066b6c200677dbbfb35e1/0_32_4014_2409/master/4014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86546971cd3efe029aaa1e7780467714","title":"george ford pivotal england winning rugby world cup","story":"The England fly-half is in cruise control – his kicking into space has been better than all the other No 10s in JapanHaving played against England at this World Cup I am not remotely surprised to see them in the final.

Eddie Jones’s men seem to be peaking at the right time and have built steadily throughout the tournament.Love him or hate him, England’s coach has been in masterful form. His “humorous” comments before games are no accident: they are designed to galvanise his team and brace them for the challenge of everyone hating England. Before USA’s game with England, Jones described us as “a bunch of Donald Trumps” to highlight our supposed unpredictability. It certainly ruffled a few feathers in our camp but, come the game, it was England who ruffled us.I do believe they turned a big corner when they played us in Kobe. A George Ford kicking masterclass illustrated the importance of playing in the right areas, proving the art of the kick can be as deadly a scoring weapon as a cut-out pass. Personally, having spent my evening trying to cover the back field, it felt like Ford was employing some kind of laser to locate space.We also experienced the full ferocity of an England pack, intent on seeking dominance no matter where they are on the field.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterRelentless is sometimes an overused word but England’s defence is like a special forces’ operation. You’re given little time to think and react. It comes at you constantly from all angles, with each player fully buying into their role. Even the mighty All Blacks looked stunned with the intensity of what was coming at them. Maro Itoje, then Courtney Lawes, then Sam Underhill, all rounded off with a no-nonsense Tom Curry and a final double whammy from the Vunipola brothers.Then there is the attack. Wherever you defend, some other space will open up. England have always been known for their physicality and ball carriers but maybe Jones’s time with Japan has increased England’s desire to play quick. They were lightning fast in the opening period against New Zealand, very similar to the way they started against us. Ford and Farrell have the ball on a string and – whether they look to pass, run or kick – they are making good decisions.Their teammates also seem to be growing in confidence. You have Anthony Watson back to his best, Elliot Daly proving why he is Jones’s rock at the back and then a bench to come on and lift the performance even more. That is what is so challenging when you come up against England. They have 31 top‑class players all contributing to a well-oiled, red-rose machine.The final against South Africa, even so, will be a challenge. Power meets power, physicality meets physicality. No doubt it will be a very different game to last weekend’s. As reflected by Jones’s pre-game statements, however, England will again have a plan to ruffle feathers. I think England will look to continue with their quick-speed-of-ball approach, rather than trying to win the aerial game straight away. It will be all about not allowing the Springboks’ big forwards to settle. Kicking-wise, I’m sure they will look to do the same as they did to us: turn the wings, make sure there is a quality kick-chase and put the back three in uncomfortable places.The South Africa half‑backs Handre Pollard and Faf de Klerk are a world-class duo so England will also be aware of the importance of shutting them down. On the flip side, South Africa will undoubtedly put Ben Youngs and Ford (if picked) under huge pressure. I believe Ford is so pivotal to England’s performance he could be the reason England win the World Cup.England’s forwards need to set the platform but the Leicester fly-half is in cruise control at the moment. His ability to suck in defenders and then put a pin-point kick into space has been superior to every other No 10 at this World Cup.Come 9am on Saturday the whole of England will be packed into pubs, rugby clubs or their living rooms at home, anxiously hoping to see another Webb Ellis Cup come back home.South Africa have been formidable and pose Jones his greatest challenge. However, I feel he has a plan, as he had for us in Kobe. England’s intensity and confidence can also carry them over the line. As someone born in England I’d like to tell the grandchildren one day that I played against a great England side who went on to conquer the world.Will Hooley plays fly-half for USA and Bedford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c515e2882e35d51caf933381d42f3ab9c554cc/0_91_3064_1839/master/3064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fca82b64985fb6e80dcdf168b82a9eb3","title":"world series game 7 washington nationals v houston astros live","story":"That’s all folksThe 2019 Major League Baseball season comes to a stunning conclusion as Washington win their first title with four victories on the road against a supposedly superior Houston Astros team.On behalf of fellow live-blogger Hunter Felt, we’d like to thank everyone for joining us for the 115th World Series: it’s been a pleasure to help you follow along. And so wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon and good night.Read all about it...Stephen Strasburg, who was infamously held out of the 2012 playoffs to protect his young arm, comes full circle, celebrating a World Series title and an MVP award for his two victories in the Fall Classic.It’s low hanging fruit, but I’m hungry. We stayed in the fight, we won the fight...the biggest thing for us is never quit. We were down 19-31, we didn’t quit then and we weren’t going to quit now!The Nationals owners, the Lerner family, are talking about how their dream came true during the traditional post-World Series win cringe-worthy interview. Now MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is doing the same before handing the trophy off to Mike Rizzo and Dave Martinez, kicking off another celebration by the Nats.That’s no way to end it? How it endedWhat is it about this team FOX TV’s Ken Rosenthal asks Max Scherzer.One through 25, everybody, the energy, the camaraderie...everybody believed in each other.Now, who will be MVP? Soto? Rendon? Strasburg? In front of a stunned crowd in Houston, the traveling Nats brass, including GM Mike Rizzo, celebrate all around. It’s the first title in DC since the American League Senators in 1924 and the first for the team that began life in Montreal in 1969. This is a team that were expected to be trounced by a team deemed superior, one seeking to put their stamp on baseball history with a second title in three seasons. But the Nats beat Cole, Greinke and Verlander, not to mention Kershaw. They won all four World Series games on the road after starting a season without their departed franchise player and opening with a 19-31 record.It is certainly one of the most improbable titles in some time. Michael Brantley strikes out swinging!Now Altuve strikes out and the Astros are down to their final out!Well, here goes nothing for Houston as they face Daniel Hudson, who comes on in relief for Corbin. And Springer promptly pops out to Cabrera!Washington are two outs away!Soto flies out to center and here come the Astros needing a rally for the ages to get back into this game. The heart of their order is due up. Rendon pops it up and Correa makes the catch on the infield. Two down for Soto. The count is full to Rendon. From the House of HunterTurner is at third base after a Marisnick throwing error. So it’s first and third and here comes Rendon with just one out!Eaton hammers a base hit right up the middle! Two more are coming in for DC and the Nats are up four and on the precipice of a first World Series title!All that pitching, all that firepower, all those wins, have landed Houston on the cliffs edge. Hinch comes out top get Smith, and it’s Urquidy, the hero of Game 4 (where has he been?), coming out now to face Eaton. And so the reckoning has arrived for Houston. Bases loaded and one out for Adam Eaton and Rendon on deck. Turner, who has done very little offensively this World Series, hitting .161 while playing well at shortstop, is up.He’s in the hole 1-2. Gomes bounces in front of the pitcher - Smith has it and fires to first for one, the throw to first is not in time. So Gomes reaches on a fielders choice, and it’s one out and one on for Robles, who singles to center!Gomes moves up to center, and it’s two on and one one now for Turner. Dangerous is this. Sidearm pitcher Joe Smith is in and greeted with a base hit by Ryan Zimmerman. Naturally they cannot allow any more runs to score or that dome is gonna empty out lightning fast. It’s 2-2 on the Astros center fielder and Corbin strikes him out swinging!Three scoreless innings out of the pen for Patrick Corbin, and the Astros have three outs left with the top of their lineup due up in the bottom of the ninth inning!Chirinos, a ground ball deep into the hole, but the catcher is a tortoise, and Turner has plenty of time to get him. Two down and here comes Marisnick, inserted for defense earlier, to try and get something going. Correa watches strike three pass on the inside corner. He has a word with home plate umpire Jim Wolf as he heads back to the dugout as frustration in Houston mounts. The good news: Houston, who have left 10 runners on base tonight, are a bloop and a blast away from tying this up. But they’re running out of outs as Correa steps in to face Corbin, who is still in there!Cabrera lines out to retire the side. It could have been worse, but an important run is in for DC as Hinch insisted on pitching to Soto in a huge spot with first base open. Makes a ton of sense!Kendrick lines a shot off the glove of Gurriel and into right field! It moves Soto to third and here comers Hinch to get Osuna!It’s unraveling in a quiet Houston dome, as watchers party inside Nationals Park in DC. Ryan Pressly in in to face Cabrera. They pitched to him and Soto made them pay - a base hit to right field scores Eaton and the Nats have that insurance run they wanted. Why on earth would you let him beat you? Because Kendrick hit a home run off the foul pole? No. That is bad managing. Sorry. Hinch is not having a good game. Rendon hits it high but shallow - Marisnick is under the ball in center field and has it for the second out. Two down, and Soto is up now. I would not touch him here with a base open. Chrinios comes out to chat with Osuna before this key at-bat begins. Eaton is running, and sliding into second. The throw is high and that’s a stolen base! And Eaton is no sprinter - he stole that off Osuna for sure. So that’s a key maneuver because now there is a runner in scoring position as DC seek that insurance run. The count is full to Eaton and it’s inside for ball four. It’s a big walk because Rendon, who started the Nats resurgence with a solo shot off Greinke in the seventh, is at the plate looking for more. Turner bounces to short, easy for Correa and that’s the first out. Eaton is next. Winter is coming...but not yet. Osuna is still on, he’s facing Turner while Gerrit Cole warms up in the Houston bullpen. The count is full to Turner.

Players start with a small number of worker units that can gather resources, construct buildings, develop new units and technologies, and embark on scouting missions to gain intelligence on opponents. Top players need adaptable short and long-term strategies to grow and defend their bases while laying waste to the opposition. To complicate matters, players cannot see the whole “map” of the game, so decisions are made on partial information.“Ever since computers cracked Go, chess and poker, the game of StarCraft has emerged, essentially by consensus from the community, as the next grand challenge for AI,” Silver said. “It’s considered to be the game which is most at the limit of human capabilities.”DeepMind created AlphaStar “agents” that play as each of the races in the game, namely Protoss, Terran and Zerg. Each race has different capabilities and technologies which favour distinct defensive and offensive strategies. AlphaStar first learned the basics from watching top human players. Then it entered the “AlphaStar league” where it played not only itself, but “exploiter” agents, which are versions of the AI that specifically targeted AlphaStar’s weak points. The training ensured that AlphaStar became a formidable opponent against all three races and every strategy.The DeepMind team restricted AlphaStar’s capabilities, ensuring for example that it could not perform moves at superhuman speeds. This proved crucial to the AI’s success, because instead of beating humans through speed alone, it was forced to learn winning long-term strategies. Oriol Vinyals, the lead researcher on the project, said AIs like AlphaStar could potentially be used to improve personal assistants, self-driving cars, weather predictions and climate models. The work was published in the scientific journal Nature.Dan Klein, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved in the work, said it was an exciting achievement driven by key advances. “What’s great about StarCraft as a testbed for AI is that all its complexities happen at once,” he said.While DeepMind states that it will never be involved in military work, and Starcraft II is not a realistic war simulation, the results will be of interest to the military, said Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of AI and robotics at the University of Sheffield. In March, a US government report described how AI enriched battlefield simulations and allowed wargamers to assess the potential outcomes of different tactics.“Military analysts will certainly be eyeing the successful AlphaStar real-time strategies as a clear example of the advantages of AI for battlefield planning. But this is an extremely dangerous idea with the potential for humanitarian disaster. AlphaStar learns strategy from big data in one particular environment. The data from conflicts such as Syria and Yemen would be too sparse to be of use,” said Sharkey.“And as DeepMind explained at a recent United Nations event, such methods would be highly dangerous for weapons control as the moves are unpredictable and can be creative in unexpected ways. This is against the laws that govern armed conflict.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdeb148a667c45319aae1dd9e7eaf8a83db98bb2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f33adad1b63a523796c210128e79dbb","title":"extraordinary tfl criticised over uber licence extension","story":"Firm had to promise to verify drivers’ identities, in deal attacked by London cabbiesTransport for London made Uber promise to verify drivers’ identities and ensure their documents are genuine in exchange for a temporary licence to operate, in a deal that drew an incredulous response from the trade body for black-cab drivers.The ride-hailing firm was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September after TfL refused to issue it with a full permit to operate in the capital amid concerns over the company’s attitude towards the safety of passengers.The temporary extension came with several new conditions attached, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.One condition, headlined “driver identity”, demands that the company put in place systems to ensure that any drivers using the app are licensed by TfL and registered with Uber. TfL asked for the pledge after a case in which a woman in Leeds was raped by a man using his brother’s login details to drive an Uber, which is not permitted by the app.Among other new conditions is a requirement that Uber ensure that drivers don’t use “f raudulent” documents for their licence or insurance.In a letter to TfL, seen by the , the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association (LTDA), which represents black-cab drivers in London, said it was “extraordinary” that such conditions needed to be imposed in the first place.“It should go without saying that London private hire vehicle operators … should have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure that drivers are who they say they are, and that they have the requisite valid licences and insurances in place,” lawyers for the LTDA wrote.They said the content of the conditions fuelled concerns that Uber’s enthusiasm for innovation was “not matched by any corresponding interest in dealing with the public safety pitfalls such innovation causes”.Uber said it had made “significant changes” to its business over the past two years, amid mounting concern about the risks that its business model poses to passengers.“This includes launching new safety features for riders, introducing better protections for licensed drivers and we’ve improved our corporate governance and compliance,” said a spokesperson.A TfL spokesperson said: “We have granted a licence to Uber London Limited to operate for two months while we request additional material from them and will consider that information as part of any future licensing decision.“As with other operators, we have attached a number of conditions to Uber London Limited’s licence, which we consider necessary and appropriate to ensure passenger safety and security.”The ride-hailing app is expected to seek a permanent licence or another extension at the end of the two-month period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e97d76ab2bbdf53554fd0a0f27181e42468cdb7/0_22_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b785eadb22a2469eafb248047d32bf7b","title":"facebook removes africa accounts linked russian troll factory yevgeny prigozhin","story":"Fake networks in eight nations are connected to man allegedly behind disinformation empireFacebook has taken down accounts linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin – the businessman allegedly behind Russia’s notorious troll factory – which were actively seeking to influence the domestic politics of a range of African countries.The company said on Wednesday it had suspended three networks of “inauthentic” Russian accounts. The Facebook pages targeted eight countries across the continent: Madagascar, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.All were linked to Prigozhin, a Russian tycoon close to Vladimir Putin. The US has previously indicted Prigozhin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. It accuses him of running a global disinformation media empire and of funding the Internet Research Agency, the St Petersburg troll factory that boosted Donald Trump.Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said Russia used almost 200 fake and compromised accounts to reach more than 1 million followers in Africa. Russian-run networks worked closely with locals in order to disguise the sites’ true origins, he said.“There’s sort of a joining of forces, if you will, between local actors and actors from Russia,” he told Reuters. “It appears that the local actors who are involved know who is behind the operation.”In recent years the Kremlin has made considerable efforts to cultivate support from African rulers. Last week Putin held the first-ever Russia-Africa forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, attended by more than 40 African heads of state.Prigozhin has led Russia’s push in Africa. Mercenaries from Wagner – a shadowy private military contractor linked to Prigozhin – have been sent to the Central African Republic. Prigozhin entities have also established media outlets in several African countries and have sent Russian “advisers” to help with elections.Moscow’s aim appears to be to bolster existing governments and smear pro-western opposition parties. Documents seen by the  earlier this year envisage grooming a new generation of African “leaders” and undercover “agents”, and pushing out former colonial powers such as France or the UK.Facebook said one fake network was centred on Sudan, where in late 2018 Russia tried unsuccessfully to prop up President Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed in April. Another – featuring 35 accounts and 53 pages – was run out of Madagascar and Mozambique. A third was focused on Libya.The campaigns shut down for meddling in Africa had posted about local news and geopolitical issues, as well as sharing content from local and Russian state media including Sputnik and RT. Some of the accounts were active as far back as 2014, Facebook said.The company did not identify which accounts had been suspended.  found that the Facebook page of a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, was no longer working.Also not working was the account for Afric, a South Africa-based website previously linked with a Russian attempt to meddle in the country’s recent election by backing the ruling African National Congress. The campaign appears to have had little impact.Researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the research lab at Stanford University, said the networks used a variety of techniques across the African countries.Some accounts supported a specific party or candidate, they said, while others backed multiple figures. In other cases, the pages appeared geared towards building support for Wagner activities or Russian deals for gold, diamonds and other natural resources.The takedown on Wednesday was Facebook’s second move against groups it linked to Prigozhin in a week. Last week the company said it had suspended a network of 50 Instagram accounts connected with the Internet Research AgencyPrigozhin has denied US claims he finances the troll factory and says Wagner does not exist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ce1d5dae7fcf44315d8a8432a1a3df4c966506/0_45_4671_2802/master/4671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=904700c2e9f18fe4b3fb5b11f77225d0","title":"twitter ban political advertising us election","story":"Social network’s move comes as Facebook faces controversy over ads that promote misinformationTwitter will ban all political advertising, the company’s CEO has announced, in a move that will increase pressure on Facebook over its controversial stance to allow politicians to advertise false statements.The new policy, announced via Jack Dorsey’s Twitter account on Wednesday, will come into effect on 22 November and will apply globally to all electioneering ads, as well as ads related to political issues. The timing means the ban will be in place in time for the UK snap election.Twitter had previously implemented rules and restrictions for political advertising.The announcement comes as Facebook is embroiled in a controversy over its decision to exempt ads by politicians from third-party factchecking and from a policy that bans false statements from paid advertisements.Dorsey explained the motivations behind the change in a lengthy Twitter thread that appeared to include several references and responses to the convoluted arguments that Facebook has put forward in recent weeks.The organic spread of political messages online “should not be compromised by money”, he wrote. The advanced state of digital advertising technology, including “machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting” and deepfakes – fake or manipulated videos that appear real – combined with the pollution of the online information ecosystem with misinformation, “present entirely new challenges to civic discourse”.“This isn’t about free expression,” he added, in a seeming riposte to the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent defense of online political advertising in a speech billed as a “stand for voice and free expression”. “This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address.”Dorsey tweeted another counter-argument to Facebook with an accompanying winking emoji, writing: “It’s not credible for us to say: ‘We’re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad…well...they can say whatever they want!’”That argument appears to mock Facebook’s recent attempts to justify its decisions to exempt posts by politicians from its third-party factchecking program, and to exempt ads by politicians and from a policy banning false or misleading statements in advertising. Together, the policies have created a situation in which Facebook is simultaneously asserting its commitment to reducing misinformation while allowing incumbent politicians and political candidates to lie in paid campaign ads.Dorsey called for “forward-looking political ad regulation”, noting that transparency requirements that have been proposed by US lawmakers are “progress but not enough.”“The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field,” he said.Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, called Twitter’s decision “another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives” while Hillary Clinton called it “the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world” and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deemed it “a good call”.Daniel Kreiss, an associate professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, argued that companies should focus on restricting the use of personal data in ad targeting rather than banning all political ads, which he said “favors incumbents and media appointed elites vis-a-vis challengers”.J Nathan Matias, an assistant professor of communication at Cornell University, said that the ban could have a number of unintended consequences, including pushing campaigns to use more bots and “hybrid human-software coordination on Twitter”.“It’s very hard to define ‘political’ things from non-political discourse,” he added. “If their policies are too loose or their enforcement too clumsy, Twitter could do real damage to public health, the uptake of government services and civic life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6782d49ba13799c0933bd5ac5998ce97c7d3355/0_124_6082_3649/master/6082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afcf9edc19c0dd7669052837d48cfa64","title":"the gatwick trial and six other ways to make travel much less stressful","story":"Changing escalator etiquette, introducing variable speed limits, and gadgets that get us to green traffic lights can all help in the quest to make travel more efficientGatwick airport is experimenting with new ways to board passengers to ease the journey from gate to seat. A trial has begun with EasyJet to board people in “columns” – window seats, then middle seats, then aisle seats. This technique, nicknamed “WilMA”, has been used by other airlines, including Delta and United. How else could travel be sped up and smoothed out with a few simple tweaks?Board airline passengers in alternate rowsThis would enable passengers to put their bags in the overhead locker without preventing others from reaching their seats. “Carry-on luggage is the thing that takes the most time,” says Burak Boyaci, a lecturer at the Centre for Transport and Logistics at the University of Lancaster. A 2008 study in the Journal of Air Transport Management showed that a full plane with two doors and no carry-on luggage could be boarded in three minutes 18 seconds.Ask passengers to stand on both sides of the escalatorTransport for London experimented with this at Holborn underground station in 2016. It found that the escalators could carry an average of 151 passengers per minute compared with 115 when travellers were permitted to stand on the right and walk on the left. However, this approach doesn’t work on short escalators. Hong Kong, Washington DC and Tokyo have also experimented.Or better still, walk on both sidesIntroduce more variable speed limitsReducing the speed limit on a motorway helps to keep traffic flowing. “If you increase the density of traffic, after a certain point, the system starts to fall down,” Boyaci explains. Slowing the traffic enables a greater capacity because it reduces the safe distance needed between vehicles.Install more diagonal pedestrian crossingsIt can be frustrating to wait for two sets of lights at a crossroads. The diagonal crossings at Oxford Circus in London and Shibuya in Tokyo allow high volumes of pedestrians to cross simultaneously.Help road users to reach green lightsA Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory system can inform motorists of the speed necessary to reach a traffic light on green.

With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen.

Can it be salvaged?• The Great British Bake Off final review – even Paul Hollywood couldn’t bear itIf Bake Off was ever supposed to sour, it wasn’t supposed to happen in 2019. It was meant to happen when it controversially moved to Channel 4 three years ago, not when we were all collectively distracted by Henry’s snazzy ties or Helena’s obsession with the undead. But this year has seen the cake contest become decidedly overbaked, and it’s not just one thing that’s gone wrong: it’s everything. Search for #GBBO on Twitter and you’ll be faced with thousands of tweets of irritation rather than admiration. While we haven’t gone off Bake Off entirely, the show seems to have forgotten what made it so compelling in the first place, fuelled by stress, tears and some near-impossible challenges. Bake Off 2019 has, frankly, forgotten how to be Bake Off. So, if you’re reading Channel 4, here’s how to fix it.Number one: get more older bakers in the mix. There was nothing wrong with this year’s contestants, but what usually sets Bake Off apart are the people you never normally see on reality TV: the Vals, the Flos, the Terrys. I didn’t think it mattered at first, but in hindsight it shifted the entire atmosphere in the tent, and left older viewers without a representative, unless you count Henry and his prematurely-aged ways.Next, make the technical challenges vaguely recognisable. Two years ago, contestants were making mini rolls and molten chocolate puddings. This year: Maids of Honour, Sicilian cassatelles and Gâteau Saint Honorés. Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith’s reasoning is that standards have risen, but we have all witnessed the weekly montages of bewildered faces and total confusion. At times, it has felt like we were one week away from Prue demanding they whip up something she thought of in a dream.Third? Turn down the heat. The allure of Bake Off has always been the illusion that it is a quaint little show, when actually it is an anxiety-driven thrill ride watching people lose it while trying to add a marzipan layer to their Battenburg. This series, however, bakers have been reduced to tears four times during a technical, including in the final, where Steph and Alice both buckled under the pressure. Noel’s whispers of reassurance and Sandi’s hugs have gone from rarities to weekly occurrences. In other reality shows this kind of thing would be normal. Here, it is crushing.But Bake Off’s biggest issue, and the one that really takes the biscuit, is the judging. The cruelty hasn’t ramped up over time it came out of nowhere this year. Prue slated everyone’s vertical pie showstoppers in one fell swoop: Sandi called the pies a “visual feast” and Prue replied “unfortunately that’s where it stopped.” Then she attacked beloved goth Helena with the barb: “If you shut your eyes, it’s a nice sponge cake.” And of course there was Paul “jokingly” storming out of the tent because he thought the technicals were awful, and going to town on Priya repeatedly, accusing her of “boiling” her custard and calling her meringue “horrible”. He also reeled off a non-stop list of failures to an already deflated Michael over his cheesecake surprise – “It droops, half of it is missing, it’s cracked down the middle, the icing looks terrible.”All of this harshness, plus Paul’s propensity to stand silently, aggressively beside bakers not answering their questions, no matter how many times they ask for help, makes the atmosphere in the tent all the more uncomfortable. It seems Bake Off is losing the very things that made it so special in the first place – its gentleness, and the sense that nothing could ever go too wrong. Now, not even Henry’s incredible tie collection could make everything OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8efd6442663642d09fd51868b06589632e0f5e/0_47_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c93cb9d90ce3e9357900bd9d5e60bf3","title":"amanda knox advice westside seattle","story":"‘Ask Amanda Knox’ will offer insight on ‘life, love, suffering and meaning’, says editor of Seattle publication Years after she was twice convicted and then twice acquitted for murder in Italy, Amanda Knox will be taking her opinions into the public sphere through an advice column in a local Seattle publication.Knox, now 32, will be periodically answering reader-submitted questions in her new column entitled, “Ask Amanda Knox” which will be published in the Seattle-area news outlet, Westside Seattle. The weekly print and online newspaper serves parts of Seattle and a few surrounding cities.The Seattle native recently married Christopher Robinson, whose family publishes the newspaper. Knox was already listed as a contributing writer and photographer for the publication. She produced opinion pieces about her time in Italy, her family and even her religion.The news comes a decade after Knox was initially found guilty of the murder of 21-year-old British student, Meredith Kercher, who she lived with in the Italian town of Perugia. She was sentenced to 26 years in jail, but she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, ended up only serving four years in prison.Last summer, she traveled back to Italy for the first time since her release from prison in 2011 for the Criminal Justice festival in Modena. She discussed the experience of her arrest and prison sentence during a debate called, Trial by Media.Knox, who has repeatedly declared her innocence, has also published a memoir and participated in a 2016 Netflix documentary detailing the case.Westside Seattle published an editor’s note on Monday introducing the new column and explaining that the four years Knox spent in Italian prison “for a murder she didn’t commit” gave her “a unique perspective on life”.“Now fully exonerated, this bestselling author and advocate for criminal justice reform offers her insights, such as they are, to reader questions about life, love, suffering and meaning,” the publication said.After the publication announced the new column on its Facebook page, a commenter wrote, “No. Just no.” Patrick Robinson, Westside Seattle’s director of new media, responded a few hours later with a lengthy reply: “For those that have doubts or still, after all that has transpired, question her innocence all I can say is if you had met her, spoken with her, gotten to know her as I have you would have nothing but admiration for her… It’s as if she was meant to go through all this to become the remarkable, and brilliant, capable and deeply sincere woman she is.”Robinson later explained that Knox is not being paid by the newspaper, she has simply “chosen to use her life experience in a positive way.”The outlet did not respond to requests for comment, and did not provide information about when the column will be published or what questions Knox will answer. It was not immediately known precisely when Knox’s column would begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa6e7ae169ab61b14f91f3bf92c8158f17eb3dc4/0_0_1167_700/master/1167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c06af3b10c5a46e493f5bdd51734ee","title":"blast from the past wellington drivers beep horns to dispel ghostly tunnel vision","story":"Commuters in the New Zealand capital are ided over tradition linked to murder of girl at site of city traffic tunnelIt won’t make any lists of the world’s spookiest places, though it is arguably one of the noisiest. Inside the bare, concrete tunnel that takes Wellington’s commuters into the city centre, a path is littered with abandoned rental scooters and the air is thick with exhaust fumes and the deafening, incessant honking of car horns.But the tradition of motorists beeping their horns as they drive through the Mount Victoria tunnel has become a city-wide superstition – and has also proved isive. Many residents believe a jaunty toot – or, for some, blasting their horns for the tunnel’s entire 623-metre length – either wards off evil spirits, or acknowledges the memory of a teenage girl who was murdered and her body buried at the site a year before the tunnel was opened in 1931.Others think the sound is obnoxious. In January, Chris Calvi-Freeman, a then-Wellington city councillor, suggested signs should be placed on either side of the tunnel advising motorists not to sound their horns to avoid annoying pedestrians, who have to share the passage. The councillor’s attempted honking ban (which has so far proved unsuccessful) sparked a backlash, with one Wellingtonian attempting to organise local drivers into a world record attempt for tunnel tooting (also, so far, without success).“I hate it when I’m walking through,” said Saxon Bruce, who was skateboarding to work down the tunnel’s pedestrian path on Thursday, armed with noise-cancelling headphones. “But every time I’m driving through, I always toot because it’s so fun.”The etiquette of tunnel tooting and the story behind it has spawned depictions in popular culture August saw the publication of a historical novel about the murdered teenager, and on Thursday, motorists’ honking was the subject of Wellington Paranormal – a television mockumentary series created by Taika Waititi and Flight of the Conchords’ Jemaine Clement about police officers investigating supernatural crime.In the latest instalment, the efforts of two hapless officers to prevent motorists tooting their horns inadvertently unleash a vengeful spirit of a constable who had died there years earlier.The story is far-fetched – but based on a real-life tragedy. Phyllis Avis Symons, 17, was pregnant when she was killed and her body left in soil at the tunnel’s earthworks site in 1930. According to research by the Mount Victoria Historical Society, there was evidence Symons was buried while still alive. Her boyfriend, George Errol Coats, was later hanged for her murder.Coats, 29, was a widower and father of six who had previously worked on the tunnel’s construction.The memory of Symons is supposedly what inspired the tooting tradition, although Joanna Newman, the historical society’s convenor, said there was no proof of that.James Gilberd, a Wellington man who investigates paranormal events with the New Zealand Strange Occurrences Society, said the Wellington Paranormal episode was likely to revive interest in the Symons story. He had never conducted an investigation of the Mount Victoria tunnel because the heavy traffic would make it unsafe, he said, but he doubted one would be fruitful.“So far on when everything’s different, there’s hardly likely to be any resonance or echo or remnant of the event,” he said. “All that we know is that it was at the south end of the tunnel, and it’s kind of spooky going in that end because you’re always in the shade when you drive in.”He doesn’t toot, he said. It irritates him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dacc5d00d93a64ab25129c8b9358d2f3af5a85/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed5174b5b30a6617af3be7fbc38e05e","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo.

Photograph: Laura HuttonFour new market stalls are to be allocated in Dublin’s Moore Street, the first new pitches designated for the street for more than 20 years. Dublin city manager Owen Keegan has told city councillors the new casual trading licences will be for the sale of “high-end producearts and crafts”. Market traders and other businesses operating on Moore Street said while the new stalls were welcome, trading conditions on the street were intolerable.“Daily we have groups of drinkers congregating around the stalls. The council keep saying it’s a matter for the police, but if every trader that had left over the years had been replaced, the street would self-regulate and we wouldn’t have these problems,” Tom Holbrook, who operates a fruit and vegetable stall, said.While there are spaces for about 70 stalls on the street, fewer than 20 traders remain. The council stopped issuing new casual trading licences for the market in the late 1990s to pave the way for the development of the Millennium Mall shopping centre. That, and subsequent shopping centre plans, never went ahead and the site is now owned by UK property group Hammerson, which plans to lodge a fresh planning application for a mixed-use retail, office, hotel and residential development next year.Mr Keegan said the council was committed to revitalising the market “in conjunction with the Hammerson development”.Stephen Troy, who runs the oldest butcher’s shop on the street, said the council should stop relying on private developers to save Moore Street.‘Paying rates’“The council needs to stop waiting for Hammerson’s plans. It’s not the prerogative of a private developer to determine what happens on the street – the council needs to address these problems. The street traders and the businesses who are paying rates deserve better.” A report from the Government-appointed Moore Street Advisory Group, recently submitted to Minister for Culture and Heritage Josepha Madigan, found the market was in a “vicious circle of decline”, with a lack of basic facilities such as toilets and inadequate power, water, lighting and cleaning.Ms Madigan has tasked the council with addressing specific recommendations of the report that it “support the retention and development of the market” and that it appoint an expert group to “lead the urgent regeneration” of the market.Mr Keegan said the expert group was being set up and would make recommendations on how to “achieve the revitalisation” of the market.However, Mr Holbrook who has represented the stall holders on several advisory groups, said he was worried the new group would be a “talking shop”.“There are things the council should do straight away provide proper lighting and sanitation for a start. I am worried this new group is another delaying tactic, and I’m worried that just putting in four new traders, when it should be 40 is setting them up to fail.”A spokesman for Hammerson said its proposals “seek to protect and enhance Moore Street’s unique heritage including its market”. Separately, Mr Keegan said the council currently “does not propose to engage” with existing traders who wish to surrender their licences.Signed documentLast month a document entitled “Licence holders who wish to be considered to exit the market”, signed by the traders who hold casual trading licences to operate on Moore Street, was sent to the council. However, Mr Keegan said the council was not seeking the removal of pitches from the street. “Correspondence was received with a list of current Moore Street traders who have apparently indicated a desire to surrender their licences,” Mr Keegan said. “Council management does not propose to engage with these traders in relation to the possible surrender of their licences at this stage.”Dublin\u0027s fruit and flower sellers to pack up their stalls"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

He told a meeting of Fine Gael Ministers that while an election now may be the best time for his party, it is not the best time for the country. He said he is Taoiseach first and Fine Gael leader second. He also said 80 per cent of people who had contacted him on the issue were in favour of a November election. Speaking to journalists, Mr Varadkar said Brexit uncertainty will continue through the December 12th UK general election. “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country, not with the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said. “We don’t know what is going to happen on the 12th of December.”Brexit deadlineIt could take weeks or months to form a government in Dublin, and he did not want to “put Ireland in that position” in advance of the Brexit deadline of January 31st. The UK may leave on December 31st, however, if the House of Commons and European Parliament ratify the withdrawal agreement in December. Asked if he and Mr Martin could agree an election date, Mr Varadkar said an accompanying policy programme would also be needed. He said the Fianna Fáil leader had already turned down his offer to agree a date in May. A spokesman for Mr Martin said: “The Taoiseach has said May and Micheál has said springEaster. There’s a difference of a couple of weeks between the two, which I am sure they can sort between them.”On any potential policy agreement, the spokesman added: “There’s a lorry load of Bills that we’ve already agreed to before committee at the moment, 58. Plus obvious ones like mandatory reporting that haven’t even got that far yet.“There is plenty to keep everyone busy. There has been enough messing. Ministers need to get on with it and do their jobs.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4066767.1572459266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach rules out snap election due to brexit uncertainty","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has ruled out a pre-Christmas election. Now is not the time for a general election as too much uncertainty still surrounds Brexit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking at Government Buildings in Dublin, he said a pre-Christmas poll was not in the interests of the country.Mr Varadkar said the Brexit process was ongoing and the UK general election could see different parties and a new prime minister holding power at Westminster. “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country given the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said.“We don’t know what is going to happen on December 12th.“Perhaps Mr Johnson is going to win a majority and ratify the deal before Christmas and we get into talks on the future relationship, but it is also possible that the Brexit Party could hold power and we may not get the deal ratified and a hard Brexit could happen.“We could see a new government and we may get a new prime minister who wants to reopen negotiations entirely and negotiate a softer Brexit.”Mr Varadkar previously said he favours an election in May 2020.When asked if he would like to see Boris Johnson remain as prime minister after they had both worked to reach a Brexit deal, he said: “I’m not going to express an opinion on who should win the election in the UK that is absolutely a matter for the people who vote in those elections.“I really do hope that a new House of Commons is in a position to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.“So far, Boris Johnson is the only one who wants to ratify the agreement... It is what I want but I also respect the will of the British people, no matter who is the prime minister and what government they decide to elect.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar told his Fine Gael Ministers there will not be a pre-Christmas general election.He made the comments at the weekly pre-Cabinet meeting of Fine Gael Ministers. No Fine Gael Minister disagreed with the Taoiseach’s view at the meeting. Although many of his ministers have lobbied for an early election, Mr Varadkar has been consistent, in public at least, in his own position that it should be held in May 2020.Mr Varadkar’s comments follow several days of internal Fine Gael speculation about the possibility of a pre-Christmas election with many in the party believing the party’s fortunes are riding high now. Some Fine Gael TDs were keen on a snap election to capitalise on the new Brexit deal and the discomfort in Fianna Fáil over ‘Votegate’ (where TDs voted for colleagues who were present in the Dáil chamber but who were not in their designated seats)and the uncertain outcome for Government TDs in the four by-elections to be held next month. Many in Fine Gael are also mindful of Enda Kenny’s decision in October 2015 to delay the last election until the following spring. As one senior Fine Gael figure said: “He rued the day of not going early. We will never get as good a chance. By January, the kudos will not last.”Four byelections are set to be held next month. Fianna Fáil and other parties have said they are prepared for an election whenever it happens.Earlier on Wednesday Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesperson Michael McGrath claimed “some Fine Gael ministers” were keen on an election so they could get out of their portfolios “because they are failing”.When asked to which Ministers he was referring, Mr McGrath said “health and housing” when discussing a possible date for the next general election on RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy said he believed the public would be quite happy if a general election was held next month.

Your answer may influence what you think about the fact that the former is taking the BBC to a tribunal over equal pay, and whether her actions in doing so are justified or not.Ahmed, the presenter of BBC News’s Newswatch programme argues that her job is equivalent, or in her words “comparable” to that of Jeremy Vine when he was presenting BBC One’s Points of View – but whereas she was paid £440 per episode, he got up to £3,000 per show – a 600 per cent pay gap.

Three Russian journalists were killed last year while investigating Wagner activities in the Central African Republic.Working with data provided by Facebook, the observatory identified 73 pages that tried to “foster unity around Russia-aligned actors and politicians” in the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Madagascar, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They were liked by more than 1.7 million accounts and had 9.7 million interactions on 48,800 post put up since December. While the pages have been deleted, The  found similar pages posting paeans in French to Mr Putin and Russian military instructors in Africa.Vladimir Putin greets the president of Mozambique in Sochi last weekThe observatory\u0027s report analysed 11 Facebook pages run from Egypt boosted Libyan general Khalifa Haftar and Muammar Gaddafi\u0027s son Saif while denigrating the UN-backed government of national accord. With names like “Voice of Libya” and “Falcons of the Conqueror,” the pages posted frequently, sometimes sharing the same content.An ally of the late Gaddafi, Russia\u0027s defence minister hosted Mr Haftar in Moscow this year for talks that Mr Prigozhin also attended. The  reported in March that Wagner mercenaries had been deployed to Libya to back Mr Haftar\u0027s forces.Leaked emails in September appeared to show that Mr Prigozhin\u0027s operatives had been advising the general as well as Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and said Russian soldiers were operating in Libya. The emails also said they had created a dozen Facebook pages to curry influence. Four pages targeting Mozambique posted about the government\u0027s supposed success in fighting the Cabo Delgago Islamist insurgency ahead of elections this month. Local media reported this week that five Russian Wagner mercenaries had been killed fighting jihadists in Mozambique. The Kremlin denied deploying any troops to the country following reports last month that 200 Russian mercenaries had arrived there. In the CAR, 13 pages that Facebook attributed to Mr Prigozhin\u0027s companies trumpeted the country\u0027s president and Russia while disparaging the UN and colonial power France. They also attempted to discredit media reports alleging abuses by Wagner mercenaries in the country, accusing outlets like CNN of bribing CAR residents for defamatory material.While Russia received UN permission to send arms and military advisors to help the CAR government fight rebels, the Wagner mercenaries have reportedly worked on both sides of the lines to develop Russian business interests. A Russian linked to Mr Prigozhin has become the president\u0027s security advisor. The social media campaign also peddled its content on Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and Telegram.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

This is a very recent change.Nick Hillman, director of think tank Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), told The Independent: “I think the sheen has faded on Jeremy Corbyn for many students while the Lib Dems are looking more attractive to them again.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 10-minute trend is for the future and is essential for adoption of electric vehicles because it solves the range anxiety problem.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Typical lithium-ion batteries would only last around 60 charges using the new method.The discovery comes just weeks after the inventors of the first lithium-ion battery were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.The combined work of John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino\u0026nbspled to the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery being produced in 1985. They are now used in everything from mobile phones to laptops, as well as the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry.Elon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberThe researchers now hope to improve this charge time to just five minutes.“We are working to charge an energy-dense electric vehicle battery in five minutes without damaging it,” Mr Wang said.“This will require highly stable electrolytes and active materials in addition to the self-heating structure we have invented.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Someone help me I can\u0027t stop smiling.Other notable donors to the campaign include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who pledged 150,000 trees, and various prominent YouTube channels.Enough money has been donated so far to plant more than 8 million trees, which will be undertaken by the Arbor Day Foundation.For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe, the TeamTrees campaign website states.Due to the sheer volume of trees planted, they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica.The goal is to raise $20 million by the end of 2019 and for planting to begin in January 2020. All of the trees funded through the campaign will be planted before December 2022.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The presenter was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after the crash occurred.\u0026nbspCelebrities such as Kate Garraway,\u0026nbspRichard Madeley, Blue singer Duncan James and Love Island star Amy Hart are rumoured to be joining this year\u0027s line-up.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them.

There, she meets Margaret, Duchess of Montenaro (also played by Hudgens), who happens to be her exact lookalike. They switch places and find themselves falling in love with the men in each other\u0027s lives.\u0026nbspAccording to Netflix, the sequel will spell trouble for Duchess Margaret and Kevin, Stacy\u0027s friend.\u0026nbspIn the sequel, Duchess Margaret unexpectedly inherits the throne and hits a rough patch with Kevin so it\u0027s up to Stacy to save the day before a new lookalike – party girl Fiona – foils their plans, a tweet from Netflix\u0027s What\u0027s Next?

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

Earlier on Wednesday, Amber Rudd, the former home secretary, and David Lidington, the former deputy prime minister, both said they\u0026nbspwould not be seeking re-election.\u0026nbspEU warns of online political disinformation ahead of UK electionMs Morgan said she had “made the very difficult decision that I can’t commit to another five-year term” and that “now is the time for me to stand aside and be at home far more”.In a letter to the chair\u0026nbspof her constituency party, she said serving as an MP had been “the greatest privilege of my life”\u0026nbspbut added: “The clear impact on my family and other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP can only be justified if, ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to – represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by th electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest.”First elected in 2010, Ms Morgan served as education secretary in David Cameron’s government but was sacked by Theresa May in 2016 and\u0026nbspbecame chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.She initially supported Michael Gove during the Tory leadership contest but, alongside Ms Rudd, became one of the most prominent members of the One Nation group of Tory MPs to agree to serve in Mr Johnson’s government.Ms Morgan backed Remain during the 2016 referendum but later became a prominent advocate of the need to deliver Brexit, including leading efforts to find an alternative\u0026nbspto the controversial Northern Ireland backstop in an attempt to secure MPs’ support for an exit deal.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 76Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters gather in

It basically isn’t feasible.”\u0026nbspThe Kremlin’s interest in the internet is relatively recent.\u0026nbspOver Vladimir Putin’s\u0026nbspfirst two terms, his administration concentrated on controlling narratives in TV and mass print media. It was only after digital technologies showed their organisational\u0026nbsppotential during the 2011-12 protests that the Kremlin began to seriously consider\u0026nbspcurbing online freedoms.\u0026nbspNow, a group of security hardliners is pushing for as close an approximation of the Chinese firewall as is possible. To this end,\u0026nbspMoscow has\u0026nbspbeen working in close technological cooperation with Beijing since at least 2015.\u0026nbspBut there are obvious\u0026nbspbarriers to the implementation of a Chinese firewall system. First, the Chinese system is a lot older – institutionalised as early in 2006 – allowing native internet technologies\u0026nbspto develop almost organically alongside.\u0026nbspThe Chinese system is also complicated, with\u0026nbspfilters existing on at least four levels: banning sites blocking IP addresses keyword blocks and mirror checks.\u0026nbspRussia moves to ban Telegram messenger appFor most of its existence, the Russian internet has been a free and uncontrolled environment. The limited filters applied today are primitive\u0026nbsp— essentially a block list implemented by internet providers\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbspand easily navigable by an average web user.switched off in 2016 after ignoring appeals to comply. But other refuseniks – not least the much larger Facebook and Google – continue to operate unhindered.And in 2018, the Kremlin suffered a most embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Telegram messaging app.\u0026nbspThe encrypted messenger was defiant in refusing to co-operate with Russia\u0027s security agency, the FSB, over their request to provide backdoor keys to user data. In April, a Moscow court blacklisted the company, in the full expectation that authorities would be able to block the programme from functioning.But Telegram\u0027s engineers were one step ahead and began to hide traffic behind dynamic IP addresses. As Russian authorities searched for Telegram’s all-elusive traffic, the authorities\u0027\u0026nbspdesperation increased and they ended up turning off large sections of the internet\u0026nbspfor hours. Online shops, banks and even the presidential site stopped were all inadvertently shut down in the process.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere is little to suggest that state officials will be any more effective this time around. But the danger, says Mr Asmolov, is that this time the legislation will do something different, since it\u0026nbspbinds government officials to the idea of changing the “infrastructure” of the Russian internet.\u0026nbsp“People with no technical expertise are making decisions about things they don’t understand, he said. “At best, it will slow the internet. At worst it will break it completely.”\u0026nbspBureaucrats will likely attempt to make “symbolic” interventions in an attempt to show that the law is working, he says. But how\u0026nbspfar they go will depend on the reaction of the Russian public. Last year, tens of thousands turned out at a protest for uncensored\u0026nbspinternet.\u0026nbspIn other countries, hundreds of thousands have turned out.\u0026nbspKlimarev says it is unlikely the security bloc will ever give up on their firewall project entirely.\u0026nbsp“These guys are obsessed with the idea of a switch to filter out countries, towns, groups of people, but that isn’t how the internet works,” he said.Thousands of Russians take to streets to protest against censorship“The fear, of course, is that they will go to the logical next step, and pull the plug completely.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal. He has a deal.It’s Jo Swinson, her SNP cronies and the Labour Party who want to scupper that deal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you run away or say anything about what happened to you, then they’re going to deport you back to your country, Laura Durán, of the charity Every Child Protected Against TraffickingUK, tells Sun Online.With nail salons now a staple on Britains high streets, offering plenty of low-skilled labour roles, its perhaps unsurprising that many Vietnamese people see them as a ticket to a better le.But this makes them easy prey for vile trafficking networks, who are thought to illegally smuggle around , Vietnamese citizens including children, to Europe each year.They lure their desperate victims with  promises of lucrative jobs in cash-only nail bars and cannabis farms, assuring them they can change their own and their familys fortunes.The sick trade has become so prevalent that over the past decade a holding camp in Northern France has been dubbed Vietnam City, based on the huge number of Vietnamese migrants waiting to reach Britain.My family back paid someone and they got me this far, a Vietnamese man at another refugee camp, located slightly further north, told The Sun on Sunday.“People in England will get me a job when I get there. It’s scary when you think what happened [in Essex] but that’s the chance you take and I am ready to risk my le.Pham Thi Tra My, , texted her mum, Im dying because I cant breatheFor migrants with enough le savings, they can buy a VIP trip to the UK - which costs nearly £, and involves a flight on someone s passport, or a doctored diplomatic one, to Europe.Or the cheaper option - so-called grass packages costing up to £, - involves a less direct route to Europe that can take several months and hundreds of miles on foot and by road.Often, migrants first travel to China or Russia before moving West entered Russia as tourists, with many then travelling to Western Europe.Other popular connecting countries including France, Germany and Poland.They go through jungles, forests and theyre kept in wooden huts, immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal tells Sun Online, describing a migrants typical, dangerous journey to Britain.The gangs are ruthless. If someone is slowing down the group the smugglers will kill them.While Vietnam as a whole has seen a reduction in poverty, not all regions have been affected equally - so the majority of migrants come from a select few poor provinces.In Nghe An and Ha Tinh - where many lorry victims are feared to be from - the countryside is dotted with billboards for labour export firms advertising jobs or study overseas.Almost everyone round here has a relative overseas, local Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is suspected to be among those found dead last week, told Reuters.Young people must find ways to work abroad because its dficult to work at home.For those who survive the horror passage to Britain, their nightmares far from over.While plenty of the countrys nail salons and grooming parlours are reputable businesses, police say the industry has become a hotbed of labour exploitation.Labour exploitation in nail bars is one of the most prevalent areas of modern day slavery in the UK, Hardeep Walker, of the National Crime Agency , told our Stamp Out Slavery campaign this year.He added: The salon conditions are usually quite small and cramped and can have a strong smell of chemicals. The exploiter will be present in the salon, often acting as a front of house member of staff who meets and greets customers and takes payment whilst keeping a watchful eye over the workers.Even when their sht is finally over, the workers have no escape - because they tend to sleep in rooms above or attached to salons, and have no money of their own to spend.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.Our Stamp Out Slavery campaign, in conjunction with Co-op, has highlighted the plight of some of Britains slaves working in car washes and nail salons, farms and factories all over the UK.We called on the government to extend support for Britains slaves beyond the current -day limit and backing Lord McColls private members Bill demanding support be extended to a year.In April this year, a high court judge suspended the paltry time limit and said it should be subject to a full judicial review.In , two Bath nail bar owners were locked up for five and four years respectively in a landmark case, after forcing young Vietnamese women to work for no pay in UK salons.Thu Huong Nguyen and Viet Hoany Nguyen trafficked the girls between salons according to demand and exploited them in plain sight, the Crown Prosecution Servicesaid.But while they didnt pay one victim - with a second earning just £ a month - a search of Thu Huong Nguyens home uncovered £, in £ notes hidden inside a teddy bear.The same year,  nail salons were raided by police across London, Cardf and Edinburgh, resulting in  arrests, in a bid to tackle the epidemic.It came six years after the extradition of gangster Do Huan Nguyen, who smuggled more than  Vietnamese people to the UK to work in drug factories and nail salons.Last year, more than  potential victims of trafficking from Vietnam were identied, ECPAT tells Sun Online - although the real number is far higher because most go undocumented.Today, many victims continue to work in exploitative British nail salons, often avoiding eye contact and conversationas they apply coats of glossy polish.But these salons floor-to-ceiling windows and bright lights provide a colourful cover for a dark, sickening secret.What do employees look like What do they sound like How do you feel Souce: UnseenOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair. Labour have been a wrecking ball long enough.They have finally realised they cannot hide from the electorate any longer.

As a cub reporter on the local paper in , I remember the shock that greeted Tory Richard Page’s by-election win. But three years later, Dale Campbell-Savours reclaimed the seat for Labour.Workington is  miles from Dover and  miles from Scotland. In the  referendum,  per cent here voted Leave. Many Brexit supporters believe the local MP, Sue Hayman, has ignored their wishes. The Shadow Environment Secretary has a majority of , but has voted against Brexit in the Commons.My own brother MARK RIDLEY, , says: “I am ‘Workington Man’. I’ve lived in my house for ten years, never went to university and love rugby league. I voted Leave in  and have supported Labour all my le. But this time, I’m voting for Boris.”The dad of three is branch manager for a builders’ merchant. He is married to Margaret, , who works in a nursing home.Mark says: “The people of Workington are honest and hard-working. They are a bit bemused about being the centre of the most important election in a generation.“We voted Leave in  but our MP has thwarted Brexit by voting Remain at every opportunity. She has failed to represent the wishes of her constituents.“People say Boris is a liar but all politicians are economical with the truth. I’ll give him the chance to come good on his promises for towns in the North.”In the Sixties, Cumbria had coal mines and a steel works. Factory jobs were plentul but many were lost to the Far East, where wages were lower. In , the steel works closed. Then the mining went.Mark says: “The town has some of the most deprived areas in Cumbria. Families struggle with poverty and drugs, so we hope Boris will honour his promise to help the North.”In the bustling Wednesday market, we struggled to find shoppers who would vote Labour. Leave voter Adrian McGreavy, , was selling his homemade cheese.He said: “My dad John was an electrical engineer and a staunch Labour man like his father before him. That tradition has ended with me. I’ll be voting Conservative. I dislike Corbyn. I don’t believe he represents the working man.“I trust Boris Johnson to carry through the will of the people and get us out of the EU. I think he wants to make sure the electorate are listened to and I trust him more than Corbyn, who has done everything he could to stop Brexit.”This could be the first time John Rodenhurst, , has not voted Labour. The pie-stall owner says: “I’ve always been a Labour voter but this time I’m undecided, so maybe I am ‘Workington Man’.“Johnson could have come back with the best deal in the world and Labour would never have supported it. Corbyn and the Labour set-up are out of touch.“They don’t realise how deeply the attempts to shoot down Brexit have been felt in towns like this. I understand what I voted for and we’re being patronised by Corbyn and the Lib Dems. A lot of their MPs will be out of a job..“In the beginning, I though Corbyn was a good leader, a traditional Labour man, not like Tony Blair, who was a Tory at heart anyway.

The boiler operator, a Labour supporter in the past, said: “Who I vote for will depend on what is good for me. I work for a Swedish company and regret voting for Brexit.”Retired chemical engineer David Exley, , is a Labour member disillusioned over Brexit. He said: “It would be a stretch for me to vote Conservative. I’ve voted Labour all my le. I voted Leave after a lot of consideration. I knew exactly what I was voting for.“I’m not fan of Boris Johnson. That man is a buffoon. But until he came along, I didn’t think we would Leave. It would have been the biggest deception of the people in my letime.”Retired NHS finance worker Roland Mee, , has always voted Labour while his we Pauline, , voted Tory. Both are Remainers.Roland said: “Workington is a Labour town and I’ll be voting for them. I can’t remember such a ided time in politics. Me and my we’s votes cancel each other out. We have a good, hard-working MP so I’ll vote as I’ve always done.”IAN Dunbar, , used to work at the Sellafield nuclear plant  miles from Workington. He said: “I voted Labour under Blair and Lib Dem under Charles Kennedy. This time it’s all about Brexit.“There is a whole world out there to trade with who will give us a better deal than the one we get from the EU. We voted Leave and that’s what we need to do. It should’ve happened by now and Johnson is the only one with the will to get that done.”Hotelier Grant Payne, , said: “Labour are not as as strong as they used to be. But I don’t think Workington will swing. I will be voting Conservative. I always have.“The biggest single issue will be Brexit. In fact, I think the Brexit Party will have an influence.”FREDERICK CHANDLER, , grew up in Sunderland but has lived in Workington since . The retired industrial process engineer said:“Normally I vote Labour but because of the mess Parliament has made with Brexit, I’ve got to the stage where I would vote for Boris.But the last word must go to Workington Woman. Great-gran Maureen Mills, , a retired factory worker, says: “The North West is pushed to the back of the queue for everything.“I’m sick of all the politics.

What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

Mr Corbyn also denied he would make any pacts with other parties to get into power.Hours earlier, Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said Labour “will not stand in the way” of another vote.Tory Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: “The election has barely begun and Jeremy Corbyn is already flirting with the SNP — bowing to their attempts to break up Britain in exchange for their support.“Labour only offer the British people more of the arguing, delay and indecision that has plagued the last three years. Two further referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence will do nothing to bring Britain back together.”As she also hit the campaign trail, Ms Sturgeon said: “It’s the most important election Scotland has had for decades, it will determine the future direction of our country for a long time to come.”Meanwhile, Remainers began plotting to convince voters to think tactically in an all-out drive to boot Boris Johnson out of No.Its analysis suggests Mr Johnson will storm to a -seat majority without tactical voting.But,just  per cent of Remain backers switch allegiance, it will swing the election and could hand Remainer parties a majority, it reveals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her resignation letter she said: The abuse for doing the job of a modern MP can only be justied , ultimately, parliament does what it is supposed to do - represent those we serve in all areas of policy, respect votes cast by the electorate and make decisions in the overall national interest. The Culture Secretary joined a raft of women leaving parliament citing abuse and the pressures of the job on their mental health or family. But the Loughborough MP is the first member of Boris Johnsonaposs Cabinet to say they will not stand again. She has represented Loughborough for the Conservatives since  and was previously education secretary.It laid bare the isions inside the Conservative Party despite the party insisting they were united ahead of the general election .  It came as former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd announced she will not stand at the election. But the ex-Home and DWP Secretary warned: “I’m not finished with politics. I’m just not standing at this election.” Her ally and friend Health Secretary Matt Hancock had called for her to be allowed in.Ms Rudd had faced having to stand as an Independent after she quit the Cabinet and Tory whip last month to protest at Boris Johnson ’s push for no-deal Brexit .The chief whip told her she would not be allowed back into the fold in case she turned on the Prime Minister again. He told her “receipt of the whip is an honour, not a right and it cannot be discarded or ed at will.” She insisted the PM asked her to stand “just last week” in the upcoming poll.    She said she “respects the decision he had been asked to make” – even though it means she won’t be allowed the whip back. Ms Rudd resigned in solidarity with  of her colleagues who were sacked from for voting to prevent a no-deal Brexit in September. Of those ten have now been offered the whip again. But  remain outside of the party.Two MPs Sam Gyimah and Phillip Lee crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrats .Antoinette Sandbach has said she will stand as an independent candidate in Eddisbury, campaigning for a referendum and Remain - and there was no offer to her to restore Conservative party whip. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond has ramped up his criticism of the PM in recent days including saying that the real reason for the election was to purge the Conservative party of moderates like him. When askedhe wanted the Conservatives to win the next election, Mr Hammond told the BBC’s Today programme: “I’ve been a member of the Conservative Party for  years and I’m agonising over this. “It really doesn’t matter how many times my party kicks me, abuses me, reviles me, they’re not going to stop me feeling like a Conservative. “I believe that my view of the world, my approach to what the Conservative Party should be, a party that stands for sound government, solid economic management, responsible fiscal management, I believe that that is where the Conservative Party has to be in the future and I’m not ready to give up fighting for the soul of the Conservative Party.” Former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve is also standing as an Independent but the Liberal Democrats are standing aside for him in Beaconsfield.

After two years of Parliamentary battles and a souring of politics, more than  MPs have decided to call it a day and not stand again. Some - like longest-serving MP Ken Clarke and Sir Winston Churchillaposs grandson Nicholas Soames - are retiring after decades of service. But others have decided the venom and anger around Brexit are making them want to call it a day. Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public le has been utterly dehumanising. Meanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally calling it a day after nearly a decade in the grand chair in the House of Commons. Hereaposs the full list of MPs whoaposve announced they are standing down so far.  When people talk about “Tory Big Beasts”, the image they have in their head is -year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushclfe MP holds the title of ‘father of the house’ - which means he’s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour ’s Dennis Skinner. And he’s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron. In fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the  years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major. He’s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since . And he’s perhaps been the Conservative Party’s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. John Bercow  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe. The ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in . Amber Rudd  Ms Ruddaposs departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs. She resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with  Tories who lost the whip in September. Yet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option. Born in London in , she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald. She went to Cheltenham Ladiesapos College and Queenaposs College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University. She married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the s but later orced. Gill, who died in , referred to Rudd as aposthe Silver Spoonapos in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral. Ms Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed. An internal inquiry later found she was not given full information herself. Her brother Roland Rudd runs the Peopleaposs Vote campaign - where he is embroiled in a furious row with his own staff over a botched bid to oust senior staff.  Boris Johnsonaposs younger brother suggested the PM was failing the national interest as he announced heaposd quit in September. The Orpington MP said he had been torn between family loyalty and the national interest but that it was time for othersto take on his role. The Universities and Science minister had previously quit the government when Theresa May as PM over her handling of Brexit. Remainer Jo Johnson added that it had been an honour to serve his constituents since . Sir Nicholas Soames  Sir Nicholas Soames is an important talisman in Conservative circles as the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - but lost the whip last month when he decided to block no-deal Brexit. The -year-old MP for Mid Sussex claimed a no-deal Brexit would be the most serious crisis Britain has faced since the Second World War. The a staunch pro-European who was a minister under John Major, also claimed Margaret Thatcher would not have taken the UK out of the EU. Confirming his decision he said: I will be voting against the government with a very heavy heart. But he was later spotted grinning during his final vote after  years - to trigger an election hours after having the whip restored by Boris Johnson.  The MP rose to prominence when he took on Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership following the EU referendum in . His ill-fated campaign saw him denying making a joke about a -inch penis, though he did finish with more than % of membersapos votes. The MP of nine years later worked in Jeremy Corbynaposs Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary while Stormont was collapsed. Heidi Allen  Lib Dem Heidi Allen will quit as an MP at the next General Election , blaming the nastiness of British politics. The former Tory MP and Change UK leader switched parties more than faced elections after she initially became dissatisfied with the Conservatives over welfare cuts. She said she was heartbroken by the decision, but had become exhausted from being shouted at in the street and sworn at on social media. In a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire, she wrote: I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Vince Cable  The former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable has been one of the partyaposs most controversial figures. A key figure in the Coalition, where he was Business Secretary, lost his Twickenham seat in  - before ing to Parliament in  and taking on the job of leading his part. A one-time Labour Party member and ex-economics lecturer, Sir Vince appeared on the Christmas edition of BBC Oneaposs Strictly Come Dancing in . Sir Vince, , was replaced by East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson and warned there would be battles about Brexit to come When he became leader in , he was the oldest person to be appointed head of a major party since Winston Churchill. A grandfather, he is married and has three children.

The boy suffered a brain injury at birth after his delivery by emergency Caesarean at a top London hospital was delayed. After his birth at University College Hospital in June , he had to be resuscitated and cooled for  hours in an effort to protect his brain. A court dealing with the case heard the north London boyaposs behaviour since his birth had led him to be branded naughty and disruptive. According to the law firm representing the boyaposs family, he presents just like any other child, but throughout his short le has exhibited grossly abnormal behaviour. His mum and dad had been accused of being aposbad parentsapos by social services and health professionals working with the boy throughout years of misdiagnosis.    The familyaposs local authority had struggled to place him in a school due to his shouting, biting, defiance and impulsiveness. The boyaposs outbursts are so frequent he requires two support workers at all times, and he has been excluded from school almost every day. He currently lives with his parents and siblings in their north London home and attends a nurturing unit in a specialist school with his own support workers. His father also looks after the boyaposs mother, who is in a wheelchair. When the mum saw how poor her babyaposss condition was after birth, she suffered severe shock. He suffered a Moderate neonatal encephalopathy, signs of respiratory distress, neo-natal hypoglycaemia, sepsis, seizures and persistent pulmonary hypertension.    A High Court judge on Monday approved a settlement of £million for the boy, after a law firm brought a medical negligence claim on behalf of his family. Fieldfisher Partner Jane Weakley said the family had suffered five years of misdiagnosis following the birth. Without it, he and his parents would likely continue to have been blamed for his behaviour throughout his le, she added. Iaposm extremely pleased that this settlement for le will allow his family to provide the best possible care to give this child the best le possible. What he thrives on is being outdoors, with space to run around in and areas to explore. But he does need two support workers with him at all times to handle his volatile outbursts. His family love him dearly and I know theyaposll do the absolute best for him.

Tom and Victoria Browne, from St Austell in Cornwall, opted for the feast, saying we just donapost do anything traditionally. Victoria, , called up Dominoaposs to find out what they could get for their budget, and the answer was quite a lot, Cornwall Live reports . The mum-of-three said: “Most people know me and Tom just don’t do anything originally. I didn’t want traditional sandwiches or anything at the wedding, I wanted something that stood out.  “We actually kept joking saying ‘shall we have Dominoaposs ’ but as it got closer and we didn’t have any food plans we started seriously considering it and I emailed Dominoaposs asking the question.” To her delight, the restaurant replied saying that it could cater their wedding, but that catering a wedding would be a first for the local branch. “I was so paranoid about whether they were actually going to be able to do it that I went in the day before and said ‘are you are all aware of my order for tomorrow ’” she said. On the big day itself, Victoria and her -year-old husband said that staff came “strolling in and shocked everybody.” They said the food was delivered piping hot as staff laid out the whopping  large pizza boxes,  garlic breads,  boxes of chicken strips and  boxes of wedges accompanied with copious amounts of the obligatory garlic and herb dip.  She said: “They were pretty good. It all came in piping hot and the staff were quite happy to stand and have a photo with me. People are still gob smacked with it, people think that as a buffet you have to have like sandwiches and stuff and I don’t really like pasties and I’m not picking them because everyone  likes them.” The couple said that when they first told people about their plans, that guests were a little sceptical. Victoria said that friends and family were certain in the run up to the wedding that she was just winding them up. She says that even her hairdresser on the day was still questioning whether they were actually going to be offering pizza in place of a traditional wedding breakfast. But the couple said that all doubt was quickly withdrawn when the smell of fresh pizza and garlic bread filled their wedding venue.

The remaining % have helped scientists conclude Otzi ascended the mountain range through the lower Schnalstal valley in modern South Tyrol, Italy. His mummied body captured global attention when it was discovered by hikers in  melting out of the ice ,m above sea level. The body was frozen alongside his clothing and gear, as well as an abundance of plants and fungi.   Jim Dickson, of the University of Glasgowaposs Institute of Bioersity, said: Most members of the public are unlikely to be knowledgeable about bryophytes - mosses and liverworts.However, no fewer than  species of these important investigative clues were found when the iceman - aka Otzi - was removed from the ice. They were recovered as mostly small scraps from the ice around him, from his clothes and gear, and even from his alimentary tract. Some of the mosses are important in investigating the precise route of his very last journey.    Several of the identied moss types thrive today in the lower Schnalstal valley. The crucial bryophyte is called Flat Neckera, a woodland species, which was found both as a large mass on his clothes and as microscopic pieces in his gut. That discovery and similar mosses from low to moderate altitude were found to be as near proof as it is possible to show the Copper Age iceman climbed from south to north up Schnalstal, rather than ascending other adjacent valleys.

Harmony-Rose was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary and needed a total of seven stitches in her head after the terrying incident on Saturday evening. Mum Dannika Richards, , says the dog Rocky had always got on with her daughter and she still cannot explain what triggered the vicious attack.The dog has been seized and remains in the care of dog wardens, pending the outcome of a police investigation, Hull Live reports.   Dannika said: “Me and my partner were just sitting on the settee and my daughter was standing next to us when the dog just went for her and pinned her to the settee. “He bit her on the head. If it wasn’t for my partner grabbing the dog quickly it could have been a lot worse. “It was terrying and blood was pouring from my daughter’s head. She was petried and we called an ambulance straight away. “Harmony-Rose had to go into theatre the next day and had five stitches on the main cut and one each on the other smaller ones. Miss Richards admits she is at a loss to explain exactly why the dog turned on her daughter.  She said: “We don’t know what happened. The police suggested maybe there were fireworks but we didn’t hear any. “Once the attack was over, Rocky acted like nothing had happened. It was really strange. “Rocky has always got on really well with Harmony-Rose. They often played together and he would cuddle up to her. “Now she is scared to be near any dogs, even my mum’s Jack Russell and Chihuahua. “The police said it was a good job the dog didn’t attack my four-month-old daughter as she could even have been killed because she is so small.” It is unclear what will happen to Rocky now. Miss Richards said: “He is still in the possession of the police and they will decide what to do. They are still investigating. “He could be put down but,not, he will be ed to my uncle’s but he will need to be muzzled and will not be allowed to live with children under  years.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i lived ghosts life after","story":"NewsI have lived with ghosts all my le after growing up in a haunted houseWriter Monica Cafferky‘s childhood encounter with a ghost in her BB home sparked a lelong interest in the paranormalShareCommentsByMonica Cafferky:,  OCT NewsMonica Cafferky has lived with ghosts all her le \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

I knew I was too old to be afraid of the dark, but I hated climbing the stairs of my childhood home in Harrogate, North Yorks. Why  Because I often felt the presence of a ghost. It was just there, watching, and it made my whole body tingle with fear. But I didn’t just sense it – I could see it too. I remember being seven years old and walking out of my bedroom into the hall. A dark cloud breezed past the doorway and down the stairs, before vanishing. “Hello,” I shouted down the dark stairwell. My voice echoed into the empty space, I was alone on the top-floor landing. However, I wasn’t alone in the Edwardian terraced house. I didn’t mention it to my parents or my three older sisters. In fact, we never talked about the spooky goings-on.    My parents were more concerned about making their BB a success – and a ghost wasn’t good for business. However, our resident ghoul certainly scared a few of our guests. One man came down to breakfast ashen-faced. “I woke up in the middle of the night and felt someone sitting on the bed,” he ­stuttered. “When I turned on the light there was an indent in the covers. Do you have a ghost ” Mum and Dad tried to laugh it off. I was brought up Catholic and went to church every week, so talking about the dead didn’t feel right. But my religious upbringing didn’t stop me from having these eerie experiences. I remember lying in bed one night on the top floor when I felt the ghost a few feet away. I pulled the covers over my head and whispered the Lord’s Prayer.    I sensed the presence leave, but then I heard an almighty crash in the bathroom across the hall. I was too scared to investigate but in the morning I found my father’s heavy glass ashtray on the floor, unbroken. Had the ghost thrown the ashtray  I don’t know, but my young mind thought it had. While I like to think the ghost didn’t wish me harm, one incident suggests otherwise. I was in the shower room with my sister Susan when suddenly she screamed. The shower room was covered in mirrored tiles and a ceiling tile fell down right above me. Just in time, Susan pushed me out of the way and the jagged glass cut her arm. I shudder to think what might have happenedshe hadn’t been there.

Mysterious things have happened at this spot - monks danced in fields, young women were tied to trees and an eerie fog seeped into gardens.And even todayyou listen carefully, you may hear the faint blows of a ghostly axe whistle from a brook across a secluded field near Coggeshall - more than  years after the woodcutteraposs death. Venture further into sleepy Coggeshall - one of the most historic and haunted towns in the UK - this Halloween and youaposll reach White Hart Hotel , spooked by at least one ghost.It wanders the old parts of the building and has been said to haunt the bedrooms. But regularsto stay in this higgledy-piggledy hotel purely for its haunted history. Have you seen a ghost or stayed at a haunted hotel  Contact webnews@trinitymirror  Rain battered the old th Century coaching inn aswas given exclusive access to brave the spectres. Scenes from The Shining flashed across our minds as a ghoulish figure seemed to float down a narrow hallway. Indeed, legend has it ghosts of two children thought to have died in a fire here roam the eerie corridors and rooms. We have a lady who wonapost stay in room two. She said she felt someone touch her in the night or felt something happen in the night. She wonapost stay there now. She still stays with us, she stays every week but she wonapost stay in room two. There have been quite a few incidents told to us by ious residents, about two specic rooms room two and room ,landlord Grant Beechey, , exclusively told .  Temperatures suddenly seemed to plummet in room , a tapping unsettled us and a creaking groaned during our stay. Downstairs, the hotel bar and restaurant bustled with regulars, some of whom had ed to brave the ghosts. Mr Beechey, a dad originally from Tooting, south London, added: These guests come back regularly, come back regularly to stay in that room. Whatever it is that is there brings them back time and time again. Room , which is the one most people come back to, is in the oldest part of the building.  We have people who come and stay in room  and the story Iaposve heard from people most often is about a poltergeist, a moving scenario where things appear, donapost appear, get moved and that type of thing. There was some evidence of spirits or other-worldly beings during our stay. A light flickered in room . The cameraaposs exposure skewed. Demons meddled in the system and the camera which had just shot scenes of full detail, fine colour and shadow had maled suddenly. Ghosts, it is said, can cause magnetism and haywire.  As dark clouds continued to gather, regulars told us theyaposd experienced a feeling of being watched, objects moving and other creepy phenomena here. Mr Beecheyaposs staff told him theyaposve been spooked. The manager said: I had a report from one of our chefs who was here on a short-term basis that heaposd felt he wasnapost alone in the kitchen when he was certainly alone.  He wasnapost disturbed by it but he had that feeling he wasnapost alone, and there was something going on. He just said he thought there was someone there with him. Certainly some of the corridors in the older part of the hotel have a look and feel about them. The building, now a Greene King establishment, mixes traditional and modern decor. Corridors, appearing to slant and tilt, guide visitors - welcome and unwelcome - to the  bedrooms.  Itaposs perhaps of little surprise to find the spooky little hotel in such an eerie little town. Coggeshall, on an ancient Roman road, is full of curious buildings associated with quirky tales. Monks held meetings in a secret room and danced in gardens, according to legend. And a coven allegedly used to meet at Marks Hall and take part in bizarre rituals, involving young women tied to trees. The ghost of a th century woodcutter called Robin roams the town, some say. Robin is said to have carved an image called the Angel of the Christmas Mysteries - but the statue was allegedly hidden and has never been found. Yet some believe blows of Robinaposs axe can still be heard near a brook which trickles through Coggeshall.

Kai Kristiansen, from Gateshead, suffered horric injuries after his motorbike collided with a car in Hexham in May . The catastrophic accident happened just three weeks after his st birthday. Kai was launched into the air and suffered serious injuries that left him in hospital for three months. He broke  vertebrae, tore open his heart and had to have one of his lungs removed. ChronicleLive also broke his ribs and suffered severe nerve damage in his neck and shoulders.    Mr Kristiansen said: “A car was turning right, and I was behind coming around the corner. I tried to overtake it and as I overtook, they turned right, and I went into the side of the car.” Emergency treatment was provided to the now -year-old at the scene and in hospital and credits the Great North Air Ambulance Serviceaposs [GNAAS] initial response with saving his le. On scene, Mr Kristiansen received advanced treatment from GNAAS which involved piercing a hole in his chest to release trapped air, which was affecting his lung and heart performance. Jeff Doran, who was on sht the day of the crash, said: We were able to perform general anaesthetic to put him to sleep to protect his brain and more importantly to take over his breathing.”    He was then airlted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and then blue lighted to the Freeman Hospital where surgeons operated immediately. His dad Alan said: “The consultants explained to me it wasn’t good. They saidyou’re a gambling man and play roulette - this is red or black – live or die.” Mr Kristiansen was then transferred to Walkergate Park Hospital where he learned to walk again and now, seven years on, he describes himself as “fighting fit”. This year he signed up to the Great North Run to raise funds for GNAAS, but nothing could have prepared him for the chance meeting at the finish line.

Mum-of-two Gill Cardall was diagnosed with a rare form of dementia called progressive non-fluent aphasia in December . The following summer, she and husband Dominic renewed their wedding vows after  years of marriage, but Gill found she was unable to walk. She began drawing apossquigglesapos to communicate with her family - but has progressed to now needing -hour care. Tragically, hubby Dominic, , now admits she is aposslowly fading in every aspectapos.    In a bid to show that dementia aposcan happen to anyoneapos and urge people to aposseize each dayapos, Dominic is bravely sharing images to show the swt and devastating impact the disease has had. The heartbreaking images show Gill as a aposwonderful and beautulapos lady in the prime of her le, smiling for the camera at a party, her hair glowing blonde. The following picture shows her grey-haired, haggard and head lolling around while strapped in a wheelchair - clutching a toy doll like a child. Dominic, from Congleton, Cheshire, said: Itaposs horrible really, to see that change.    Gill was the le and soul of any party. She was kind, thoughtful but always spoke her mind. She always thought about others, never missed anyoneaposs birthday and loved to be the centre of attention. She was a very popular lady. [Now], she has become a frailer version of herself. Itaposs asshe is slowly fading in every aspect - physically, mentally and just in who she is. Itaposs like sheaposs being erased by [dementia]. Iaposd never seen the first photograph of Gill before - it was sent to me by one of her friends who was down at a Womenaposs Royal Naval Service reunion this weekend. It knocked me sideways really. I got quite upset. The photograph was the last time Gill went [to the reunion] four years ago. Thataposs what hit me. I knew how much it meant to her.

They have two daughters, Emily, , and Georgia, , who now help with their mumaposs care. Both girls still lived at home when Gill first became ill, and they noticed her starting to struggle with her speech. Dominic said: The first sign that anything was wrong was Gill started to have speech problems. At first we didnapost know what it was. Sheaposd say the wrong word in a sentence or get a word mixed up. It progressed over the next couple of months where she was having real problems with her speech, then her work contacted me to say she was having dficulties. We saw the GP and what was flagging it up for me was Gillaposs mum had Alzheimeraposs and her eldest sister, Anne, had dementia.  Gillaposs condition is a type of frontal temporal dementia. It affects the speech element of the brain. Sheaposd get words mixed up or couldnapost find the right word. For example, she asked me to aposget her handbag out of the cartonapos. She didnapost realise she wasnapost saying car. That was one of the things I realised she was adamant about. It wasnapost a slip of the tongue. We always called the TV remote control the aposzapperapos. But she would say aposcan you pass me, that tele-pointer thingapos. Sheaposd say aposIaposd like a cup of hot water with a bag in itapos, rather than a cup of tea. Her brain was trying to work things out but getting them wrong, or mixed up. Since Gillaposs family had a history of dementia and Alzheimeraposs, Dominic admits he feared from the beginning it was his weaposs fate. As her speech deteriorated, he noticed her personality beginning to change. His aposkind, lovingapos we had started to become aposless empatheticapos and when their girls came home with good exam results, Gill failed to react.

Molly-Rose Taylor, , said doctors had previously dismissed her complaints as aposperiod painsapos - and it was left up to her to secure a diagnosis. The nanny suffered agonising period pains from the age of nine-years-old which caused her to become delirious and frequently faint. She was misdiagnosed four times and says multiple doctors failed to spot the cm thick wall of tissue running vertically down her vagina known as the longitudinal septum - which caused her to have two.    After five long years, Molly-Rose began to thoroughly research online and discovered her condition, she is sharing her story for the first time to raise awareness of uterus didelphys. Molly-Rose from Gillingham, Kent, said: When I first started my periods, doctors would blame my age and say my body is still young and canapost cope. But now I know it is because I am having two periods at once, I have been on birth control since  years-old to try and reduce the heavy flow and fainting. As I got into my early teens, I attempted to use tampons, but it would fall straight out, I thought maybe it was normal. It wasnapost until I became sexually active with my then boyfriend, I began to worry as it was impossible and very painful. I noticed there was a piece of skin in the middle and two holes and I felt so embarrassed. From the outside, you would never even know, even the doctors didnapost as I had attended three appointments.    Before my diagnosis I was advised to get tested for a sexually transmitted disease due to the bleeding and abnormal discharge. It came back all clear, as predicted - I knew something was wrong and began to research myself which was a challenge itself. Molly-Rose says there was a lack of knowledge and awareness in the medical practise and she had to tirelessly research online before finding uterus didelphys. She adds: There wasnapost any leaflets for me to read nor doctors who could help me understand my condition which is why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis.    I told my GP that I know what it is and was referred to a gynaecologist and I requested general anaesthetic for the intrusive vaginal scan. I went on to have general anaesthetic for my second gynaecologist appointment... I was desperate to get some answers. Within ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas - I felt so happy to finally know what is wrong.

They left secretive bases on the Arctic Kola Peninsula a few days ago, passing close to north Scotland. It is the largest underwater operation launched by a Russian leader since the end of the Cold War. Norway’s intelligence service is trying to track its progress with increased surveillance flights. Norwegian sources believe Russia’s aim is for the fleet to penetrate as far as possible into the North Atlantic without detection by NATO, sailing submerged north of Scotland through the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap.  The flotilla raises challenges for NATO and threatens its maritime re-enforcement and re-supply lines across the Atlantic. It comes as Russia’s most advanced new nuclear-powered submarine test-launched its first Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile, hitting a target thousands of miles away. The launch was conducted in the White Sea off Russia’s north west, with a dummy payload reaching a test site in the far eastern Russian region of Kamchatka.    The Borei-class vessel, part of a dferent fleet, was submerged when it fired but the escalation in aggression comes amid arms-control tensions with the West. It was seen as a bid to show how Russia is able to defend its own bases while threatening the US Eastern Seaboard.

The public are being urged to stay away from the whale, which marine experts believe could be the youngest ever calf ever stranded on British shores. The whale has washed up on Hell’s Mouth in Gwynedd, North Wales and the public is being urged to stay away as it may carry diseases which could be transmitted to humans.NorthWalesLive reports this is the first time a sperm whale has ever washed up on a Welsh beach.And it only the second time it has happened anywhere in the UK in more than  years.    A spokesperson of the British Divers Marine Le Rescueestimated the calf to be between two and three-years-old, which could make it the youngest ever stranded. The BDMLR spokesperson said: “It is very important to note that cetaceans – whales, dolphins and porpoises – are mammals like us humans, and therefore able to carry serious diseases that can be transmitted between us. “We would advise members of the public to avoid all contact with the carcass and any bodily fluids to avoid any risk of infection from them. There is the possibility that this may have been an animal that was already ill. The marine mammal is believed to have become stranded yesterday and a team from Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programmeand the Zoological society of London are heading to North Wales to examine it and determine the cause of death. They will be working with a team from Marine Environmental Monitoring.    The team of experts told reporters this was an unusual stranding. The CSIP are conducting a postmortem later today to determine the cause of death. The calf hasnapost yet developed it teeth, which suggests it was still surviving on milk from its mother. Usually, a mother sperm whale will to produce milk for the first two years of its calfaposs le, but they have been known to do so for as long as four years. Sperm whales usually survive in deep waters and hunt giant squid.

Others point them downwards to ensure they donapost slice off a finger when it comes to unloading, which is actually pretty wise now we think about it. Others throw it all in with cutlery going both ways. We call those people psychopaths.    But Ashley has finally given us a definitive answer, and much like the Jay Sean classic, itaposs down, down, down. Although he admits there are valid arguments for cutlery facing both ways, he believes there are three main reasons why down is king. The first, as mentioned above, is safety. Thereaposs no point ruining your clean utensils by bleeding all over them because you stabbed yourself with an upward-facing kne. The second is that it makes unloading the dishwasher easier at the end, with the handles ready to be grabbed and thrown into the cutlery drawer. And finally, it means fewer germs and smudges. Facing them up means your grabbing the eating ends, treating everyone to a few of your hand germs the next time they tuck into a meal.    Ashley explains: Your fingers are covered in germs and bacteria, so obviously you want to minimise touching any surface thataposs going to come into contact with your foodyou can. On a more benign level, your fingers could also leave smudges on the shiny blades of knives, which isnapost a good lookyou have guests over.

She was sure her chin and nose were growing, especially after looking back at old photos of herself and seeing that her face looked smaller.

My best friend, Anisa, held my hand while we went from pub to pub and I remember her asking me where my confidence had gone since we met at university. Thankfully she was there for me because I would have never made it through that night without her cheering me on. The next few days were awful, I slept most of the day and still required more than ten hours of sleep at night. I went to see a doctor for an opinion in the hopes of any sort of answer. I have seen more than ten doctors over the years who would just address my symptoms. I have been misdiagnosed with borderline diabetes, generalised anxiety disorder, depression and PCOS.  I told this doctor that my face was changing, and I was getting uglier, and that I didnapost understand why I was gaining weight since I was barely eating. She issued me a blood test and then called me back in and told me I had a pituitary tumour based on the results of that test. Normal range for the growth hormone is between  and , and I was at a whopping  level - which is high even for a teenager with gigantism. There really is no information other than extreme cases online. Thereaposs barely any awareness or tools to help people recognise the signs, so many cases are diagnosed as hormonal disorders. I saw the scariest photos of Andre the giant and others who had not been treated early on during the process. I was mortied, scared, and hopeless.  The tumour caused the extreme tiredness, my anxiety, weight gain, the growth of my hands, feet, nose and chin. I had this tumour for over  years based on the photos Iaposve looked back over, but I just thought it was the way I was ageing at the time. I questioned my growth a few years ago when my feet shot up half a size, but I had gained weight too and I thought it must have been caused by water retention or my borderline diabetes diagnosis. I went to Alberta and an endocrinologist, Doctor Nisha Haroon, got me in a for a CT scan that same day and that was when we saw my tumour. I was petried because I had a tumour in my brain which they needed to remove, butI didnapost have surgery then I would continue to become disfigured! Surgery was April  by Doctor Cusimano and the tumour was taken out through my nasal cavity.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at. I always look at myself and what I can improve on and that’s something I need to look at personally.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dca to host christmas craft and design market","story":"DCA will host a special Christmas craft and design market at the end of next month.Crafted will feature work from  independent designers and makers from across Scotland.Among the items that visitors can buy will be jewellery, textiles, illustration, print and homeware.There will be opportunities to the find a gt for family and friends in the lead up to Christmas.The market will be held on Saturday November  and will run from .am to .pm.It will be held on the ground and first floor of the contemporary arts centre.The event is free to attend and no booking is required.More information about the exhibitors who will be participating in the event will be made available in the run up to the market day.For more information, visit the DCA’s social media."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db2ad05abd6b8.82495880.jpg ","title":"downfield golf course submit plans for driving range","story":"Management at a city golf course have remained tight-lipped over claims of illegal tree-felling even after submitting plans for a new driving range nearby.Officers at Scottish Forestry are continuing to probe activity at Downfield Golf Course after trees were cut down on land earmarked for a new housing development.Earlier this year the club submitted a planning application in partnership with developer Kirkwood Homes to build  homes on the land beside Dalmahoy Drive.It has been suggested by both the club and the housebuilder that the project is essential to guarantee the long-term future of the course.However, the trees have been felled before planning permission was even approved – leading to local residents accusing developers of a “done deal”.Scottish legislation requires that anyone looking to cut down trees needs to get a felling permission from the government, eventhe plants are not protected.A felling permission for the golf club was granted in  but has since expired.In addition, the land on which the trees have been cut down is designated as a “locally important nature conservation site” by the council.Despite this, the local authority has insisted that the land is not bound by any protective measures.Both Dundee City Council and Kirkwood have denied being behind the tree-felling.And despite repeated requests for comment the club is yet to respond.The Tele visited the club’s offices last week and were told the course manager, John Watson, was on holiday until this week.And despite the club’s ongoing silence, a new planning application has been submitted to city planners proposing a new driving range.Designs for the new driving range have been drawn up with the proposed housing in mind.A .m-high embankment is proposed for the furthest end of the field to protect the most vulnerable homes from wayward golf balls."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.44049200-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united boss pleased with teams response to recent defeats with 2 0 win over dunfermline","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson says he is pleased with the way his team responded to recent defeats in their -

The quality of the collections we have in Aberdeen, it needs a building to showcase it.”The revamped gallery, which has been hit by delays since closing its doors, will also go some way to helping the city “ersy” its economy, the council co-leader claimed.She said: “It was important to us that we made sure we provided a world-class visitor attraction that will attract not just local people but tourists from far and wide.“It’s always been our intention to make sure the redevelopment is a world-class facility.“I think that’s what we have achieved, it’s taken a bit of time but I think with the age and complexity of the project it was important we made sure we got everything right.” vw, px\"  Douglas Lumsden, who co-leads the local authority alongside Ms Laing, claimed the gallery rivals any regional gallery he has seen where.He added: “The collection we have is absolutely fantastic and we can now exhibit three times more than we could, we’ve gone up from  gallery spaces to .“We can show off a lot more and I think we’ve got a fitting gallery to host the collection we have.”The redevelopment has dramatically increased the amount of display space for the city’s nationally-recognised collection, with the number of galleries increasing from  to  and the number of items on display increasing from  to ,.Among the changes are the construction of a whole new top floor, which museum bosses say will be a “game changer”, offering “new vistas” across the city.The Remembrance Hall has also been revamped and now includes new digital rolls of honour. vw, px\"  These will scroll continuously on the wall of the hall, showing the names of everyone recorded in the city’s Book of Remembrance.Technology has been introduced across the buildings, with digital touchscreens providing more information on many of the works.Meanwhile, new LED lighting has been installed in the roof of some of the gallery space, which gives the impression of natural light and can be changed as the seasons change.Aberdeen City Council has pledged £.m from capital funds, and the National Lottery Heritage Fund has made a £m contribution but the council is still £.m short of its £m public fundraising target.Oil firm BP has donated £m to go towards its gallery space and £.m has been given by the UK Government to support the Remembrance Hall renovations.The ongoing public fundraising campaign will continue, with Mr Lumsden claiming he thinks visitors will be inspired to donate to the project once they get inside this weekend. vw, px\"  He said: “My feeling is now the gallery is open this weekend, once people come and visit, I think people will contribute to the gallery we’ve built here.“There’s still a dispute ongoing with the main contractor and that dispute will continue and we’re trying to minimise the cost to the council as much as possible.”Councillor Alex Nicoll, SNP resource spokesman, said: “The city has been robbed of its Art Gallery for far too long so I’m delighted that it will be open again very soon.“Sadly, this is not the end of the story as the administration still need to tell us how much money this project has actually cost the people of Aberdeen.”The first members of the public will get access to the gallery this weekend but tickets have sold out for the event.More than , free tickets were snapped up within hours of being released last month, with timed slots in place to ensure the best experience for visitors.From Monday, regular opening times will be am to pm Monday to Saturday and Sunday from am to pm, with free admission."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

of whom I, too, am not a fan # you give not a single example to back up your contention that he is #causing serious economic and social harm to both Argyll and Bute and Scotland as a whole#.While no-one expects the truth from politicians in general, we do actually expect it at a local level.R Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,The Scottish SPCA is urging the people of Scotland to share their stories, photos and memories of the charity as it prepares to celebrate its th birthday.Set up with the goal of aiding overworked horses and ponies in Leith, Scotland’s animal welfare charity was founded on  December .The Scottish SPCA now has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle hospital in Clackmannanshire. Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

With Mondays five matches delivering only one win it was a rather downbeat team who gathered for the team meeting that night.Stuart #The Forest# Johnston couldn#t see the wood for the trees, The Sneddon couldn#t see the goal for the hanky protecting his head from the sun, Iain #Caravan# MacDonald was thinking too much about camper vans, whilst Tom #The Gin# Kilcolm didn#t live up to his name and went nearly tea total.Captain Anderson though delivered when it mattered. With Colin #The Cat# in goal, Sneddon was deployed at the back alongside. MacDonald, Johnston and Kilcolm were pushed further forward with the captain and #The Scribe# Litster in midfield. As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul

choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

To say that was a blow would be the understatement of my le.:Row over BBC Laura Kuenssberg biased anti-Sturgeon tweetFresh out of university at the time, I wasnrsquot in the least bit clued up on the  Equal Pay Act, but I knew that paying him more than me just wasnrsquot right and making that discovery was gutting. Our employers, it seemed, knew they had done wrong too: though they initially tried to dismiss my complaint on the basis that my colleague had to drive to work while I could walk, they quickly conceded that that was irrelevant and raised my pay by pound. It was hardly the stuff movies are made of, but the victory felt signicant nonetheless.And yet here we are in ,  years after a tiny victory that came  years after the Equal Pay Act was written into law, and women are still being put in the position of having to ask their employer to account for why they are being paid less than men for doing work of equal value. From council workers to news anchors, there seems to be no shortage of women for whom the law has offered no protection until they have taken action to enforce it, with BBC presenter Samira Ahmed this week becoming the latest in a long line of women forced to take a stand in the name of equality.Ms Ahmed, a freelance journalist who was formerly a reporter and presenter on Channel Four News, has for the past several years hosted a range of programmes for the BBC, including Radio rsquos daily arts show Front Row and the BBC News channelrsquos weekly points of view programme Newswatch. She has taken the broadcaster to the Central London Employment Tribunal over what it pays her to present the latter, arguing that she should get the same pound, a show that Jeremy Vine is rewarded for presenting Points of View rather than the pound an episode she has been paid since taking over the programme in .She would appear to have a point. Points of View may air on BBC One while Newswatch is available on the news channel only, but to all intents and purposes what Ms Ahmed and Mr Vine do on those programmes is broadly the same. Both are at the helm of presenter-led shows that last for  minutes, are aired once a week and offer the public the opportunity to give their views on BBC content. Sure, Jeremy Vine has to relay comments about programmes that are produced right across the BBC while Ms Ahmed handles views on news programmes only, but does that mean he deserves to be paid close to seven times as much as her for it  Does anyone really think that the situation is a fair one Well, yes, some people obviously do. Because despite being here before with former China editor Carrie Gracie - who last year was awarded yearsrsquo worth of back pay after receiving signicantly less than the men doing the same job in other parts of the world - and despite agreeing to pay Ms Ahmed more for her work on Front Row and Radio rsquos Night Waves Free Thinking - where she had been earning % and % less than her male equivalents - the broadcaster is adamant that the disparate levels of pay awarded to Mr Vine and Ms Ahmed can be justied. Their programmes, though similar, follow dferent formats, you see, with Mr Vinersquos being classed as entertainment while Ms Ahmedrsquos is seen simply as news. The fact they are shown on dferent channels has also been offered up as an excuse.:BBC lsquois facing wave of pay claim tribunalsrsquo as Ahmed case beginsThanks to the other women who have been willing to stand up and challenge the law on equal pay before her, it seems likely that Ms Ahmed could win the argument. After all, when Dumfries and Galloway Council argued in  that the salaries paid to female classroom assistants and learning support staff could not be compared to those of groundsmen and road workers it was quickly stopped in its tracks.Just because male and female employees work in dferent locations, doing dferent jobs does not mean they cannot be compared for equal-pay purposes the Supreme Courtrsquos now president Lady Hale ruled, setting a precedent that has been applied to Glasgow City Council and supermarket giant Asda in the years since. Taken in that context, the dferent-channel, dferent-format argument expected to be deployed by the BBC in the employment tribunal would seem to be more than a little bit thin.Yet proving that Ms Ahmed should be paid equally to Mr Vine evenshe can prove she works equally to him could end up being easier said than done, with employment lawyer Ross Meadows pointing out that the BBC will still have ldquoa genuine material factor defence argument in its armoury. You see while it is one thing to show that a man and woman are carrying out jobs whose value can be said to be the same, itrsquos another thing to expect them to be paid equally for them, with experience and seniority sometimes allowed to trump equality in the eyes of the law.And this is where women, despite supposedly having had the law on their side for close to  years, have been set up to fail again and again. In a working world where men continue to hold all the most senior positions, where they use those positions to hire in their image - often without ever making it known there are jobs available to compete for - women are fighting a losing battle when it comes to gaining the experience that would confer on them the seniority that gives them the right to be paid equally.Until that problem is addressed - until women are allowed to compete on the level playing field we are repeatedly told is open to us - unscrupulous bosses will always have a get-out on equal pay and the situation will continue to self-perpetuate.As she was getting ready for her tribunal hearing this week Samira Ahmed released a statement in which she noted that the back of her BBC pass is inscribed with a set of values that include showing respect for each other, celebrating ersity and taking pride in delivering quality and value for money. In light of that, she said, ldquoI just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.Regardless of what the tribunal decides, it is a question we would all benefit from knowing the answer to."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10605410.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ministers-admit-needs-done-meet-scottish-climate-target","story":"The Scottish Government has set a target for % of non-electrical heat demand in Scotland to come from renewable sources by .And energy minister Paul Wheelhouse has now said the country wascurrently at .% leading to concerns that the Scottish Government will miss its target.

For all those doing a Brenda from Bristol and despairing at the forthcoming festive GeneralElection, there was a place of refuge last night on Channel .A dear place where nice people made scrummy cakes for the simple pleasure of doing so, where no one was called a traitor, and where the losers were not expected to spend the next three years trying to overturn the result.The tenth series started off ten weeks ago with a bakerrsquos dozen of contestants. Now just three remained: Alice, the stressy one Steph, the lacking in confidence one and David, who was wearing trousers far too nice to wipe floury hands on.ldquoIrsquom definitely the underdog, declared David, so immediately he was the one to watch.Steph had her own gameplan going on. \"Come on baking fairies,\" she pleaded. \"Jump on my shoulders.\"The signature challenge was to make the ultimate chocolate cake. ldquoNot just any chocolate cake, said judge Prue Leith, on duty as ever with Paul Hollywood. What would that be, then  A singing and dancing chocolate cake  A world peace-bringing chocolate cake In Davidrsquos case, ldquoultimate meant sloshing in as much booze as possible without setting the hallowed tent on fire.As we watched the three contestants working away frantically, their heads bowed over mixing bowls, one wondered, not for the first time, why no one had to wear a hairnet in Bake Off. Perhaps, being not really of this cruel world, the programme is exempt from lsquoelf and safety regulations.Since this was the final, we got to see short videos of the contestantsrsquo nearest and dearest paying tribute to their loved ones. Stephrsquos mum had had to do a lot of washing up, but didnrsquot mind a bit Alice had been baking since she was knee high to a plate warmer ditto David. Wise move. Contestants have reached a standard which is to all intents and purposes professional. You wonrsquot go far on Bake Off these days by merely being able to knock up a simple apple crumble.The technical challenge was to make twice-baked Stilton souffles with fancy crackers. Alas, Stephrsquos creations were not even once baked, which brought on the first but not the last of the eveningrsquos tears. She had put cold water in her bain-marie when, as any fool with access to Google knows, it should have been hot.Alice was upset as well. Her parents had been at a wedding in Dublin and it looked like they would not be able to get a flight back in time for the final. Hardly the stuff of  Hours in AE or Panorama, but then this series has been lacking in heart-stopping moments.Personality-wise, the contestants have been more vanilla essence than cherry, maple, gin or some other exotic flavour. Not their fault most of them were just very young. Anyway, the sweetness on show, in the contestants as much as the baked goods, served as a moreish counterpoint to what was going on in the outside world. In a final show of harmony, the three finalists even entered the Bake Off tent hand in hand.At last, it was time for the showstopper round in which the bakers had to make picnic baskets stuffed with items that looked like other things. So fig rolls were sausage rolls, cakes were bananas, et cetera. \"Illusion cakes\" they were called. Whatever lights your oven.Suddenly, word came through: Alices parents were on the plane! Meanwhile, Stephs macarons were not going well. Such is the giddy whirl of le, on and off Bake Off.David, cool as Stephrsquos bain-marie, had triumphed. The -year-old international health adviser had beaten Alice the geography teacher and Steph the shop assistant.

This only passes problems on to routes that require vessels with larger capacity, better facilities and better seagoing performance.ldquoDespite the inclement weather last week, it is the case that the freight provision remains inadequate.He added: ldquoShortages and delays which have real tangible financial impacts on our local economy.ldquoWe are committed to continuing to work with the Scottish Government and CalMac to ensure more successful planning and deployment of future ferry services for island communities.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoCalMac, as the operator of the Clyde  Hebrides Ferry Services, manage connections across the ferry network. Through Transport Scotland we work closely with them, local businesses and communities as we seek to enhance services across the entire network, and have invested pound. billion in the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services since  to this end.The dry dock schedule is an annual mandatory regulatory requirement for all vessels and are necessary for the fleetlsquos continued safe operation.ldquoWhile CalMac is responsible for vessel deployment decisions during the annual dry dock period, Transport Scotland will engage with CalMac through our on-going contract management arrangements and considerthere are any lessons that can be learnt in relation to future decisions on vessel deployment and resilience during annual overhaul periods."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-rude-awakening-ahead-nightmare-christmas","story":"Labourrsquos final humiliation was signalling that it would agree to the election it rejected only on Monday on the grounds that No Deal had not been taken ldquooff the table.Well,hard Brexit does now happen, after next yearrsquos trade talks, Labour will only have itself to blame.

There has been real concern over access to Insch station for a number of years and Nestrans have been working with partners to ensure we can come to a solution.”“This is a crucial piece of work to determine the untapped potential in and around Insch and I would encourage members of the community to come along, see the possibilities and let us know their views.”The consultation event will be held on Monday, October , in the Platform  waiting room from -pm.Residents are welcome to go along to provide feedback on accessibility issues and potential options with members of the project team.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The former Inverurie Market Place School\"  Inverurie community hub plan rejectedviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Bonfire Night, and the weeks leading up to it, is the busiest time of the year for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.\"  Firefighters called out to  deliberate fires a week viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"top honour for chriopractor elisabeth","story":"An Inverurie chiropractor has received a prestigious award from the British Chriopractic Association.Elisabeth Davidson, who owns Inverurie Chiropractic Clinic, received the award at the associaton’s conference in Birmingham for services to the profession.She is only the second person to receive this award.Elisabeth celebrates her th anniversary as a chiropractor this year and has owned Inverurie Chiropractic Clinic for ten years.

In Facebookrsquos earnings conference call mdash which began less than an hour after Mr Dorseyrsquos tweet mdash Mr Zuckerberg issued an impassioned monologue about what he called Facebookrsquos deep belief ldquothat political speech is important and stood by the companyrsquos decision to run unchecked political ads. He denied this choice is financially motivated, saying such ads make up less than half of a per cent of the companyrsquos revenue.To put that in perspective, he added, Facebookrsquos recent five billion dollars Federal Trade Commission fine was more than  times that. ldquoThis is complex stuff. Anyone who says the answer is simple hasnrsquot thought about the nuances and downstream challenges, he said. ldquoI donrsquot think anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or we havenrsquot thought hard about these issues. A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.mdash jack ###October , The issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from US president Donald Trumprsquos campaign that targeted former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.In response, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran an ad on Facebook taking aim at Mr Zuckerberg. The ad ly claimed that Mr Zuckerberg endorsed Mr Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate hood as necessary to make a point.A final note. This isnrsquot about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has signicant ramications that todayrsquos democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. Itrsquos worth stepping back in order to address.mdash jack ###October , Critics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. This includes CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the policy of allowing lies ludicrous and advised the social media giant to sit out the  election until it can figure out something better.Google did not have immediate comments on Twitterrsquos policy change.Twitter currently only allows certied campaigns and organisations to run political ads for candidates and issues. The latter tend to advocate on broader issues such as climate change, abortion rights and immigration.The company said it will make some exceptions, such as allowing ads that encourage voter turnout. It will describe those in a detailed policy it plans to release on November .Twitterrsquos policy will start on November .Mr Trumprsquos campaign manager called Twitterrsquos change a ldquovery dumb decision in a statement on Wednesday.ldquoThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever, campaign manager Brad Parscale said.The presidential campaign for Mr Biden said it was ldquounfortunate that companies would think the only option was to completely ban political ads.ldquoWhen faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out, Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for Mr Bidenrsquos campaign said in a statement.copy -.

For it is very clear that the uncertainties around both Brexit and the potential for a second independence referendum, are factors acting as a drag on Scotland’s economic performance. But that doesn’t tell the whole story.Last week the respected Fraser of Allander Institute issued an economic commentary looking at Scottish performance in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. They pointed to evidence of the negative impact of political uncertainty: business investment in the UK having now been negative in five of the past six quarters, and both consumer confidence and risk-appetite amongst businesses being weak.A deal with the EU will, according to Fraser of Allander, help lt some of the fog of uncertainty that has hung over the Scottish and UK economies in recent times, and deliver a short-term economic boost. The impact of Brexit in the longer term will depend upon the exact terms of the future relationship with the EU.: Fraser of Allander report paints mixed picture for Scottish business: Extra income from Scots tax rises ‘wiped out by slow wage growth’If we burrow deeper into the economic commentary’s findings, we learn that there are specically Scottish concerns which cannot be attributed solely to Brexit. Scotland’s annual growth rate is now just . per cent, compared to that of the UK as a whole at . per cent. Since , the Scottish economy has grown at four per cent compared to five per cent in the UK and seven per cent in the EU. And, while some of the recent weakness in the Scottish economy can be pinned on Brexit uncertainty, the actual trend in activity since early  is broadly in line with the period between  and . So even before the EU referendum, the Scottish economy was underperforming the UK average, and that trend is simply continuing.Tens of thousands without jobsThe employment figures tell a similar story. In the three months to August, Scottish unemployment jumped . per cent, and employment fell by . per cent. This means that Scottish unemployment is higher than the UK average, and the employment rate at . per cent substantially below that of the UK at . per cent. That represents tens of thousands of adults of working age who could be making an economic contribution and paying taxes, but are not currently doing so.Whilst it may be very convenient for SNP ministers to blame all of Scotland’s economic woes on Brexit, the facts simply do not fit this narrative. There is something  going on here, above and beyond our departure from the EU.When we look at business confidence in Scotland, political uncertainty is being caused not just by doubts about the future post-Brexit, but concerns about the prospect of a second independence referendum. With no certainty as to what currency we might use post-independence, how we would fill the fiscal gap of £. billion, or what our trading relationship would be with our largest export market in the rest of the UK, it is no wonder that Nicola Sturgeon’s relentless drive for indyref is having a negative impact both on business and on consumer confidence.Financial executives filled with horrorDespite all this there are key strengths to the Scottish economy. There was a palpable sense of positivity and optimism at the Scottish Financial Enterprise annual dinner last week, with businesses across the sector showcasing dynamism, innovation and investment in skills. This is a sector where Scotland’s reputation has always been strong, and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon.For many of those I spoke to at that dinner, whilst Brexit uncertainty is a concern, it is issues closer to home that they regard as more of a threat. The prospect of an independent Scotland running a dferent currency from the UK is one which fills financial industry executives with horror, and would inevitably lead to a substantial exodus of capital, and with it thousands of well-paid jobs.The SNP’s tax regime, ensuring that anyone earning above £, pays higher taxes than the rest of the UK, is also an ongoing concern. For young ambitious, talented, highly mobile iniduals, levels of taxation are a factor in determining where they accept job offers, andwe continue to see a growing ergence between Scottish tax rates and those where in the UK then the impact on Scottish business is bound to be negative.Fraser of Allander concludes in its report that there is need for a more open discussion of the underlying growth dynamics of the Scottish economy. That is a debate that the Scottish Conservatives are up for. Our Scottish Future Growth Council has already published a suite of proposals on how to improve productivity in our economy, and will shortly be producing its second report on shting our economic performance into a higher gear. Bringing in serious measures to tackle our economic underperformance, rather than simply blaming the Brexit bogeyman, is what is going to make a real dference in the future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit pm s deal could leave every scot 1600 worse off claims snp","story":"The assessment estimates that under the free trade agreement envisaged in the deal, GDP would be .% lower in  years time compared to forecasts under continued EU membership.The analysis also states that the potential for delays to trade and non-tarf barriers, such as country of origin rules and regulatory alignment, could leave food and drink, digital and service sectors particularly vulnerable.Presenting the new assessment to the Scottish Parliament, Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell told MSPs: ldquoThe paper we have published today sets out the impact of this disastrous deal on Scotland. It removes any pretence that the UK intends to seek a future relationship with the EU beyond a limited free trade agreement.ldquoThe Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that Scotlandrsquos economy is already around two per cent smaller - £ billion - than it would have been without the vote to leave the EU and, letrsquos be clear, this exit deal does not in any way lsquoget Brexit donersquo. It would merely unleash fresh, ever more complex and ever more acrimonious disputes on the population.\"The likelihood is that it merely postpones a lsquono dealrsquo crash out for little over a year.\"Mr Russell said that by granting Northern Ireland continued access to the Single Market, the deal puts Scottish companies at a competitive disadvantage. He also said that failed to address an expected decline in Scotlands working age population caused by the ending freedom of movement for people.In an increasingly heated Chamber, with cries of \"rubbish\" from the Tory seats, Mr Russell said the new Brexit deal was now at the heart of the upcoming election campaign, and added: ldquoThe UK Government has repeatedly failed to live up to its promises to fully involve the devolved administrations in the Brexit negotiations. The result is a bad deal which will damage Scotlandrsquos interests and ignores our democratic will.ldquoThe people of Scotland have the right to determine their own future free from Brexit as an independent member of the European Union.However Mr Russells presentation of the impact analysis in Holyrood was branded a \"party political broadcast in the most hysterical and ridiculous terms\" by Scottish Tory economy spokesman, Murdo Fraser. Raising the issue with the Presiding Officer Ken McIntosh, he said: \"Ministerial statements are to inform Parliament, they should not be used as a  minute party political broadcast on behalf of the Scottish National Party. Im aware we have a general election on its way, but parliamentary must not be abused in this fashion.\"Mr McIntosh urged MSPs \"not to bring election politics too much into this chamber, please keep election campaigning outside the chamber and keep the chamber for government business.\"Scottish Tory constitutional spokesman Adam Tomkins, said he had expected apologies from Mr Russell and Nicola Sturgeon for their previous statements that Boris Johnson would not achieve a deal.He added: \"The truth is Mike Russell called for a transition period. Boris Johnsons new deal provides for one. Mike Russell called for no hard border on the island of Ireland, Boris Johnsons new deal ensures we wont have one. Nicola Sturgeon called for a guarantee on EU citizens rights and Boris Johnsons new deal provides it.\"Is it not the case the SNP rail against this deal because they want the most chaotic Brexit possible  Is it not the case they want a no-deal Brexit, because the only thing they care about is independence and they think the shortest route to independence is a no-deal Brexit \"Mr Russell said he had constantly opposed a no-deal Brexit. He added: \"I wish to see an end to Brexit and of course Mr Tomkins used to wish to see no Brexit originally, its a pity hes walked away from that for purely party advantage.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that it was \"incredulous\" the Conservative MSPs were defending a deal which \"puts a border in the Irish Sea, when they condemned that deal last year.\"But he added: \"Im puzzled that the minister states that breaking from the EU will bedisaster but breaking from the UK will be of benefit. Does he not get it by now that putting up borders and barriers costs jobs and the economy, that we need to learn the lessons of Brexit, not repeat them with independence \"Mr Russell said that the Liberal Democrats no longer had a plan to stop Brexit. \"His only plan was to have a second referendum and we would still support that referendum,were there a prospect of it succeeding,\" he said.He said Mr Rennie had \"consistently failed to address the central question\", that \"because he cannot guarantee in any sense that there would be a defeat for the forces of Brexit now or in the future, theres only one surefire way of getting Brexit finished and moving on as a normal nation, and that is independence.\"Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie raised the downgrade of commitments to provide a lsquolevel playing fieldrsquo with Europe in the new Brexit deal. He said: ldquoLiz Truss, the trade secretary, said that scrapping those protections is vital to giving the Tories the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals.On the same day an unnamed cabinet source said the level playing field policy lsquohas to gorsquo because lsquoit would seriously restrict our ability to deregulatersquo.ldquoIf that Withdrawal Bill is put forward after this general election, we face the very real threat that the Scottish Parliament may be unable to protect Scotland from this kind of hard right extremist ideology.

Characterising those behind Viking Energy as silly, mad or idiotic is simplistic, inaccurate and unhelpful.Some, but certainly not all, of the backersand approvers were incorrectly motivated by honestly held environmental concerns.Tom Morton’s name springs to mind.Ian Tinkler’s phrase, “Green loonies”, does nothing, however, to capture the aice that motivated some of the others who, vocally or secretly, also backed the scheme.Neither does Ian’s phrase address the  “development-at-all-costs” notion that the council must always be on a mission to find and back the next big thing.Their job should instead be to see things are fairly considered.Ian may be right to argue the inter-connector is unaffordable, that Shetland needs an intermediary gas-fired power station # possibly en-route to a publicly owned eco-grid # but he’s foolish to garble so important a message.An independent commission may be needed to look at how Shetland’s future energy needs can best be met.The council could have a role in calling for one.And Ian Tinkler can retain his self-stimulating role in calling others silly names at random for his own pleasure.As for “snowflake”, well bless his cotton socks.Would he could stick to his point.In all seriousness, I wince when I read the word ‘ loonies’ in these columns. Would it not be possible for this to cease Rather than Green Lunatics, how about, ignorant, aicious, self-serving, greedy fools. I could go on but the Big Girls Blouses of the PR brigade may be offended. That would be tough on Girly Swots.!!! Sorry for the windup folks, I do not suffer pretentious fools all that well.Side comment : I believe when Sullom Voe, was being planned, an arrangement was negotiated where SV could supply gas, via pipeline, to the power station here in Lerwick, at very little cost, thus the cost of power to the people of Shetland, becoming one,not the only, cheapest source of energy for the consumer. However, the get out clause, the Hydro-Board, asked BP could the guarantee % supply  No surprise, BP said # No. #. That being said, we, Shaetlanders# were denied a cheaper cost of energy and a cost of living. I believe. Could this arrangement still be in the pipeline as an alternative to Viking Energyin providing a cheap source of energy Well Ian, that was almost an apology laced with get # out clauses.!!Making references to the so called PR brigade and Big Girls’ Blouses does nothing to assuage people who deliver their opinions in reasonable, measured tones.To attack with great relish says a great deal more about the attacker than the attacked. One can very readily understand why so much intolerance in the world makes it an unsafe place.Being proud of such a weakness merely serves to compound the problem.With patience and a large slice of contrite thinking, things could repair and meaningful exchanges COULD take place.Roll on.Since May . The  MWe plant has four  MW General Electric Frame  gas turbines . It may be more cost-effective to modernise and expand this plant at Sullom than build a gas pipe to Lerwick. Unless I am mistaken a connecting power line is cheaper and less environmentally damaging than a pipeline. If Shetland ever gets its renewable act together this plant would act as the backup power station until a non-fosil fuel plant was established. A tidal generation would be the obvious solution with hydrogen back up and storage used for transport and energy storage.Thank you Ian, for your comments. directly coming from Sullom Voe Haydn makes a worthwhile point. We shouldn’t be contributing in harmfully in ways that feed stigma around issues of mental health.People should not feel discouraged from seeking help that could be le saving. I have some sympathy with those at the Shetland Times who have to decide which of the comments offered here do not “observe normal standards of decency and tolerance”, but perhaps the style book needs updating. There is a related problem in which when we point out the problem this particular perpetrator gets double his satisfaction and then feels stimulated into issuing further offensive posts.This problem would be lessened were the Shetland Times to simply refuse to carry posts containing terms such as “loonie” and “lunatics”. I suspect the staff periodically consider such issues and wouldn’t be troubled by the prospect of being considered “Big Girls Blouses”or indeed “pretentious fools” were they to cut less slack.It is also possible to become desensitised, even to such annoyances as the distracting sound of a dentist’s excessive drill.The profit motive aside, I can’t see the subsea cable being preferable to Shetland becoming self sufficient through sustainable renewables..."},{"url":null,"title":"electrical engineer electrician at scale aq ","story":"• Experience working within aquaculture is desirable but not essential as training will be given.• Full driving licence is essential.• ScaleAQ offer a competitive salary, private healthcare and training development opportunities.ScaleAQ is the result of  years of experience and consists of Steinsvik, Aqualine and AquaOptima.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

The rural roads around Ballymena are a disgrace.”Katie came across the cat recently during the school run.She said: “Less than  hours after we did the clean-up of our road we came across this poor wee cat caught in a crisp packet just around the corner from us, as we did the school run. This wee creature had totally given up and was just crouched at the roadside, waiting for death. “I pulled the bag off, and it sat stunned for a moment, gasping for breath, before it ran off, terried. I am just so glad we found it in time.”Katie said that because of someones littering “this wee soul nearly died, and a family nearly lost their pet”.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

Belfast shoppers have no appetite for Christmas electionBrexit likely to dominate on hustings in Northern IrelandEarlier, MPs voted by  to  to reject a Labour amendment for the proposed polling day to be moved to December  — three days earlier than ministers wanted.The parties here were quick out of the starting blocks following the vote.DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed the election being held on December  and said it is “right that the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box”. data-dfpadtargetingColum EastwoodMrs Foster added: “The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next Government, Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.Arlene Foster“Unionists need their strongest team ed so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament. That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Incoming Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, who has attracted criticism by ruling out his party stepping aside in certain constituencies — including North Belfast — to allow DUP candidates a clear run, said Northern Ireland needs to elect UUP MPs who will stand against the Prime Minister’s plans, which will destroy the Union. data-dfpadtargetingLady Sylvia HermonHe said: “This is the most important election the people of the United Kingdom have ever faced.“Boris Johnson’s deal with the EU is an existential threat to the Union. It puts a border in the Irish Sea and places Northern Ireland on the window ledge of the Union.“This election will be an opportunity to send Ulster Unionist MPs to Westminster who will not be patsies to a Tory Government or ever agree to a border down the Irish Sea.“Northern Ireland has been betrayed by Boris Johnson’s Conservative Government and we need to send a clear message to him and his advisers that we will not sit back and let him destroy the Union.”Sinn Fein has already selected a number of candidates to contest the long-expected Westminster election, including Belfast Lord Mayor John Finucane to challenge DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds’ slim majority in North Belfast.The party’s vice-president Michelle O’Neill said the vote was an opportunity for people “to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit”.It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.Michelle O’Neill“Sinn Fein has successfully made the case to the Irish Government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement.“The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers.“The people of the north did not consent to Brexit.“There is no good Brexit for Ireland. Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions. The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the election will be a defining moment for Brexit and every opportunity to defend the interests of people, businesses and communities must be taken.He said: “For three years the democratic decision taken by people in Northern Ireland to reject a border on this island, to maintain the free and frictionless relationship we enjoy with Europe and to sustain our fragile peace has been wilfully ignored by successive Conservative Governments and by the DUP. The coming election is an opportunity to reject the politics of ision and deadlock.“This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down.“Our MPs have, with the exception of Sylvia Hermon, either facilitated this disaster or stood outside on the lawn shouting in.“They have failed to defend our interests. It’s time to give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on that failure.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party is best placed to unite Remain voices here. “This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests.“Northern Ireland voted to Remain. If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”A TUV spokesman said: “It has been clear for sometime that this Parliament was incapable of delivering anything. The election is long overdue. \"The Prime Minister says that he will be fighting on the basis of getting “Brexit done” but in support of an agreement which is not Brexit for the whole UK, but only for GB. It would leave Northern Ireland in the waiting room for a united Ireland, with the Union riven by a border down the Irish Sea.\" "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38646309.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/ENCE30-10-201905.jpg","title":"sinn fein targeting dodds seat as party aim for eight mps with john finucane victory","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A senior Fine Gael source said that Mr Varadkar had \"absolutely\" ruled out a November election at a meeting of the partys senior ministers this morning prior to the weekly Cabinet meeting in Government Buildings. Another source said that Mr Varadkar left zero wriggle room in his remarks to his ministers and that there was no dissent at the meeting.Speaking notes circulated within Fine Gael this morning urge the partys Ministers, TDs and Senators to state that the government is \"pressing ahead with its work programme, creating jobs, growing the economy, and supporting families\" and that the Taoiseach has made clear that May  is his preferred date.With the Brexit deadline extended and an election called in the UK, the Taoiseach has come under pressure from his own ranks to go to the country on November  - the date currently pencilled in for four Dáil by-elections - in recent days. Fine Gael TD and former EU Affairs Minister Dara Murphy broke ranks yesterday to publicly declare that now is the right time for Mr Varadkar to go to the country. He joined the many ministers and Fine Gael TDs who are privately pressuring the Taoiseach to call a snap poll.The Irish Independent reported earlier this week that many Fine Gael Cabinet ministers privately favoured a snap election in November.Party sources also said that preparations for an election were \"very advanced\" with the manesto and staffing arrangements almost finalised.

Because we know whose side we’re onJeremy CorbynMr Corbyn will say: “This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country, take on the vested interests holding people back and ensure that no community is left behind.“So, we’re going after the tax dodgers. We’re going after the dodgy landlords. We’re going after the bad bosses. We’re going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we’re on.“Whose side are you on  The dodgy landlords, like the Duke of Westminster, Britain’s youngest billionaire, who tried to evict whole blocks of families to make way for luxury apartments  Or the millions of tenants in Britain who struggle to pay their rent each month “Whose side are you on  The bad bosses like Mike Ashley, the billionaire who won’t pay his staff properly and is running Newcastle United into the ground We have a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country.

In Facebook’s earnings conference call — which began less than an hour after Mr Dorsey’s tweet — Mr Zuckerberg issued an impassioned monologue about what he called Facebook’s deep belief “that political speech is important” and stood by the company’s decision to run unchecked political ads. He denied this choice is financially motivated, saying such ads make up less than half of a per cent of the company’s revenue.To put that in perspective, he added, Facebook’s recent five billion dollars Federal Trade Commission fine was more than  times that. “This is complex stuff. Anyone who says the answer is simple hasn’t thought about the nuances and downstream challenges,” he said. “I don’t think anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or we haven’t thought hard about these issues.” A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.— jack 🌍🌏🌎October , The issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from US president Donald Trump’s campaign that targeted former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.In response, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran an ad on Facebook taking aim at Mr Zuckerberg. The ad ly claimed that Mr Zuckerberg endorsed Mr Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate hood as necessary to make a point.A final note. This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has signicant ramications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address.— jack 🌍🌏🌎October , Critics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. This includes CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the policy of allowing lies ludicrous and advised the social media giant to sit out the  election until it can figure out something better.Google did not have immediate comments on Twitter’s policy change.Twitter currently only allows certied campaigns and organisations to run political ads for candidates and issues. The latter tend to advocate on broader issues such as climate change, abortion rights and immigration.The company said it will make some exceptions, such as allowing ads that encourage voter turnout. It will describe those in a detailed policy it plans to release on November .Twitter’s policy will start on November .Mr Trump’s campaign manager called Twitter’s change a “very dumb decision” in a statement on Wednesday.“This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever,” campaign manager Brad Parscale said.The presidential campaign for Mr Biden said it was “unfortunate” that companies would think the only option was to completely ban political ads.“When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,” Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for Mr Biden’s campaign said in a statement."},{"url":null,"title":"489746","story":"ALZHEIMERS Society Mid Ulster is holding free information sessions for those who want to learn more about dementia.

Trees, woods and forests help people feel better, encourage more active lestyles and alleviate the symptoms of some debilitating conditions. So, it makes perfect sense to combine your daily exercise with a trip to the great outdoors. Derry is home to stunning woodland and riverside walks such as the recently restored Ness Woods with its impressive new adventure playpark for children.You also have Burntollet, Brackfield and Prehen Woods - which dates back to the s – amongst others.A spokesperson for the Woodland Trust expounded on the countless benefits of spending time in woodlands saying scientic studies have shown that “green exercise” can improve self-esteem and mood, as well as reducing stress, anxiety disorders and depression. She explained: “On top of that autumn offers the keen nature watcher the opportunity to enjoy the flurry of wildle gearing up for winter. “At this time of year you can spot migrant fieldfares feeding on hawthorn berries or catch a glimpse of jays burying acorns for winter, which in turn makes them excellent tree planters as they usually leave a few behind. “Combine that with the vibrant autumn colour on offer and what’s not to like about being outside.”She continued: “Prehen Wood is one of the Woodland Trust’s rare and irreplaceable ancient woods, dating back as far as . “The woodland is a natural treasure trove, a place of great beauty offering a peaceful walk along a looped pathway – and all on the doorstep of the city. “Venturing  miles south of the city and into the Faughan Valley you can explore  Woodland Trust woodlands offering beautul walks with picturesque views including Burntollet Wood, Brackfield Wood, Kilaloo Wood, Oaks Wood and Bonds Glen. With neighbours Ness Country Park owned by NIEA this area offers bountul choice for visitors to enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push   Prehen Wood Prehen Wood is a remnant of the extensive woodland that once covered most of the River Foyle from the Craigavon Bridge to County Tyrone. When English planters came to Derry in , Sir Henry Docwra, the then governor, wrote in his memoirs that he sent men daily from the city over to these woods to bring back timber and that they had to fight for it daily.The Wood was once part of the Prehen House Estate, which in  totalled  hectares. After the first world war the estate was sold off in pieces, including the remaining woods, which were sold in  for timber production.A local outcry ensued about the imminent destruction of the woodland and the editor of a local paper took up the cause, calling for some timber to be left standing. Prehen Wood was spared and is viewed as a “green lung” for the people of Derry.With a lot of support from the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society, the Woodland Trust acquired the Woods at Prehen to conserve it for future generations.Prehen Wood made up of beech, oak, ash and birch trees is known for its bluebells, but it also boasts over sixty natural plants species including anemones and orchids, wildle such as long-eared owls, the native red squirrel, badgers and sparrowhawks, as well as a sculpture trail. Solace  Romantic poet, John Keats, in an ode to Autumn described it as the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.George McLaughlin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society recalled that line as he spoke of the beauty of Prehen Woods and invited people to explore local woodlands at this time of year.He said: Where better to be than in Prehen Woods in the Autumn, or at any time of the year, although bluebell time is recognised as the best time of year. Autumn is the next best time to experience our wonderful ancient woodlands.Your impression dfers depending on the time of day you visit, he explained: In the morning when we have the first frost of Autumn you can see intricate patterns of the spiders webs stretching from twig to twig mysteriously created during the night.Early morning is a good time for wildle watching at the aptly named foxes corner of the woodland. You may see one or more of the famous foxes of Prehen or be lucky enough to witness theof the Prehen red squirrel.At midday a heavenly beauty is created by the Autumn sunshine filtering through the canopy of the many ieties of tree. In todays busy world, there is something relaxing and healing about the feeling of solace to be found in an ancient woodland.”Over Halloween the woods take on a dferent complexion, George explained: In the evening time or in the glowing as they call it in Ireland, and especially at Halloween mysterious shadowy figures seem to appear from behind every ancient tree. Are these the famous ghosts of Prehens fabled past The screeching of long eared owls and the raucous call of the jays all add to the seasonal spookiness of the special creation that is Prehen ancient woodland.This Autumn season of mists and fruitfulness certainly rings true of a woodland at this time of year where theres an abundance of berries, nuts, acorns and toadstools to be found.

Trees, woods and forests help people feel better, encourage more active lestyles and alleviate the symptoms of some debilitating conditions. So, it makes perfect sense to combine your daily exercise with a trip to the great outdoors. Derry is home to stunning woodland and riverside walks such as the recently restored Ness Woods with its impressive new adventure playpark for children.You also have Burntollet, Brackfield and Prehen Woods - which dates back to the s – amongst others.A spokesperson for the Woodland Trust expounded on the countless benefits of spending time in woodlands saying scientic studies have shown that “green exercise” can improve self-esteem and mood, as well as reducing stress, anxiety disorders and depression. She explained: “On top of that autumn offers the keen nature watcher the opportunity to enjoy the flurry of wildle gearing up for winter. “At this time of year you can spot migrant fieldfares feeding on hawthorn berries or catch a glimpse of jays burying acorns for winter, which in turn makes them excellent tree planters as they usually leave a few behind. “Combine that with the vibrant autumn colour on offer and what’s not to like about being outside.”She continued: “Prehen Wood is one of the Woodland Trust’s rare and irreplaceable ancient woods, dating back as far as . “The woodland is a natural treasure trove, a place of great beauty offering a peaceful walk along a looped pathway – and all on the doorstep of the city. “Venturing  miles south of the city and into the Faughan Valley you can explore  Woodland Trust woodlands offering beautul walks with picturesque views including Burntollet Wood, Brackfield Wood, Kilaloo Wood, Oaks Wood and Bonds Glen. With neighbours Ness Country Park owned by NIEA this area offers bountul choice for visitors to enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push   Prehen Wood Prehen Wood is a remnant of the extensive woodland that once covered most of the River Foyle from the Craigavon Bridge to County Tyrone. When English planters came to Derry in , Sir Henry Docwra, the then governor, wrote in his memoirs that he sent men daily from the city over to these woods to bring back timber and that they had to fight for it daily.The Wood was once part of the Prehen House Estate, which in  totalled  hectares. After the first world war the estate was sold off in pieces, including the remaining woods, which were sold in  for timber production.A local outcry ensued about the imminent destruction of the woodland and the editor of a local paper took up the cause, calling for some timber to be left standing. Prehen Wood was spared and is viewed as a “green lung” for the people of Derry.With a lot of support from the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society, the Woodland Trust acquired the Woods at Prehen to conserve it for future generations.Prehen Wood made up of beech, oak, ash and birch trees is known for its bluebells, but it also boasts over sixty natural plants species including anemones and orchids, wildle such as long-eared owls, the native red squirrel, badgers and sparrowhawks, as well as a sculpture trail. Solace  Romantic poet, John Keats, in an ode to Autumn described it as the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.George McLaughlin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society recalled that line as he spoke of the beauty of Prehen Woods and invited people to explore local woodlands at this time of year.He said: Where better to be than in Prehen Woods in the Autumn, or at any time of the year, although bluebell time is recognised as the best time of year. Autumn is the next best time to experience our wonderful ancient woodlands.Your impression dfers depending on the time of day you visit, he explained: In the morning when we have the first frost of Autumn you can see intricate patterns of the spiders webs stretching from twig to twig mysteriously created during the night.Early morning is a good time for wildle watching at the aptly named foxes corner of the woodland. You may see one or more of the famous foxes of Prehen or be lucky enough to witness theof the Prehen red squirrel.At midday a heavenly beauty is created by the Autumn sunshine filtering through the canopy of the many ieties of tree. In todays busy world, there is something relaxing and healing about the feeling of solace to be found in an ancient woodland.”Over Halloween the woods take on a dferent complexion, George explained: In the evening time or in the glowing as they call it in Ireland, and especially at Halloween mysterious shadowy figures seem to appear from behind every ancient tree. Are these the famous ghosts of Prehens fabled past The screeching of long eared owls and the raucous call of the jays all add to the seasonal spookiness of the special creation that is Prehen ancient woodland.This Autumn season of mists and fruitfulness certainly rings true of a woodland at this time of year where theres an abundance of berries, nuts, acorns and toadstools to be found.

It has acted as a lightning rod and a proving ground for the erse and deeply talented musicians of Derry Donegal whether making their first steps or continuing careers in creating music. It has also been an education in new music from all over the world for each of us”.Keith Mannion from Slow Place Like Home said “I am so proud to have been part of Stephen McCauleys truly adventurous and ever-informative show, which bows out tonight, after  long years on the airwaves.

A thumping th minute point from Emmett McGuckin put Adrian Cush’s side three points ahead and they were full value for it. Glen, led by skipper Danny Tallon and young gun Alex Doherty, staged a late comeback but the closing stages saw Sunday’s decider, in front of over , fans, end in controversy as the Watties went in search of an equaliser. Shane Heavron squandered a stoppage time free for an insurance point but as the clock ticked towards the end of the allotted extra four minutes, Connor Carville built from a short kick-out. Referee John Joe Cleary seemed to allow Glen one last attack. A final roll of the dice. Connlan Bradley advanced and when Danny Tallon was awarded a free outside the ‘’ he elected to work the ball short. Yet, still play continued. As Glen patiently worked the ball into a scoreable position, the final whistle sounded. As Magherafelt’s celebrations ignited, Ciaran McFaul’s kick seemed to go over the bar but it didn’t count. Glen’s protests fell on deaf ears as a sea of red and white engulfed Celtic Park. While Glen can feel aggrieved at not being given a few additional seconds, they played second fiddle to a cool, calm and collected Magherafelt side for almost  minutes of this decider. The zip that tore Slaughtneil to shreds was absent and once Magherafelt got to grips with the game, it appeared that Glen would need to find the net to land the silver in their first ever final. For the first time in the campaign, Jude Donnelly’s side settled first. After securing possession from the throw-in, they played keep ball for a full three minutes before Emmett Bradley passed to Danny Tallon for the opening score. Ethan and Jack Doherty interchanged before Paddy McLarnon fouled and Paul Gunning doubled the lead. It was the start Glen needed to play the game on their own terms but Magherafelt didn’t flinch.  Wins over Coleraine and their second-half grind against Banagher left them battle-hardened.  From the resultant kick-out Shane Heavron caught brilliantly but when he passed to his brother Danny over the top they looked like carving out an opening. The advantage wasn’t given by referee Cleary, play was called back and Shane fired over from the free. When the industrious John Young got inside Jack Doherty and was fouled, Heavron’s second free levelled the game.  In the th minute, Emmett McGuckin fed Shane Heavron but his low shot lacked conviction and Oisin Hegarty’s foot presented a goal, with Alex Doherty kicking over the first of his four points at the end of a counter-attack. When Paul Gunning hoovered up the break from the kick-out, Doherty booted over another score and Glen were - to - ahead. It was then that Magherafelt began to turn the screw in the game. They hemmed Glen into their own half. The Heavrons were off target and Antone McElhone hit the post but when goalkeeper Mullan-Young fluffed a kick-out, Glen were on the defensive and Cahir McCabe’s push on Shane Heavron handed the Rossa dead-ball specialist the chance to level matters after  minutes. An Emmett Bradley catch led to a Tallon point on the run and Glen were ahead. They could’ve opened a four point lead when Gunning and Emmett Bradley combined. Ethan Doherty was in on goal but the angle favoured Odhraacuten Lynch who stood up until the last minute to make the save. Seconds later, Emmett McGuckin swivelled his hips to buy space before kicking an equaliser. From the kick-out, McGuckin flicked to Danny Heavron, who passed to Antone McElhone for a point. With Glen ‘keeper Callum Mullan-Young struggling with his kick-outs, with a lack of movement outfield and midfield trio of McFaul, Dougan and Bradley unable to won the aerial battle, Glen’s grip on the cup began to slip. Heavron cut out a miscued kick-out to set-up John Young for a point. A further miskick saw Conor Kearns in on goal but Carville’s tackle saved Glen’s bacon. A second turnover of the half from Fergal Duffin began a breakaway, with Danny Heavron setting up his brother Shane for his only effort from play and Magherafelt were - to - ahead at the break. Glen needed an impetus and when Ciaran McFaul grabbed the throw-in, he gave Glen an early spark and Danny Tallon swung a long-range point. The story of the half was Magherafelt’s ability to hold Glen at arm’sand with Odhraacuten Lynch’s assured kicking, they had control of the game.  While Glen ran into Magherafelt’s perfectly laid trap and forced passes that weren’t on, their opponents were squeaky clean in possession. It was all about precision. Magherafelt’s decision to start Conor McCluskey on Jack Doherty was a masterstroke. He constantly forced Glen on the back foot. He added a point but once again Alex Doherty, this time with a crisp left footed effort, fired over to put three in it again. But Magherafelt’s game was a more polished version of their  version. Shane Heavron’s pass put Emmett McGuckin in and when he slotted between the posts there were four points between the sides yet again, with  minutes gone. McCluskey’s pressure couldn’t prevent Jack Doherty from squeezing over the bar, however, Glen were going to need a goal. But it was Magherafelt that carved open the chance. Lynch’s kick-out was perfectly flighted. Jared Monaghan was involved, Darren O’Neill and Paddy McLarnon ferried the ball forward before Conor Kearns was cut down by Ciaran McFaul and a penalty was awarded. After a delay, Shane Heavron took the kick but Mullan-Young got down to save. The Glen ‘keeper reacted by pushing Heavron to pick up a booking but later intercepted when the Magherafelt wing back had a half-chance on goal. At the other end, Odhraacuten Lynch was flawless under the dropping ball. Tallon, Alex Doherty and Emmett Bradley floated points over in the closing stages as Magherafelt began to retreat. A replay was looking a distinct possibility with Glen’s waves of late attacks but they will carry the controversial conclusion into the winter months. What    But finals are all about the winners and Magherafelt’s greater control took John McLaughlin to join the reserve, U and U titles already at Rossa Park and an U final to look forward to on Wednesday.

MAN OF THE MATCH: Odhraacuten Lynch – Danny Tallon and Alex Doherty were the shining lights for Glen, with Emmett McGuckin among many Magherafelt contenders. However, in the pressure cooker environment, Odhraacuten Lynch’s kicking was fantastic throughout, he got his angles perfect to deny Ethan Doherty and was ice cool under the dropping ball. TURNING POINT: Lynch save – Glen had just edged into a - to - lead after  minutes when Ethan Doherty had his goal-bound shot saved by Odhraacuten Lynch. Emmett McGuckin replied with a peach of a score and in the  minutes that followed the Rossa press shut down Glen’s kick-outs, helping them to a four point interval lead. SCORE OF THE GAME: Emmett McGuckin – Within seconds of Lynch’s save, Rossa went on their trademark swt counter-attack and after a deft dummy, McGuckin fired over the bar to level the sides. It was the start of Magherafelt’s period of control and they never looked back.

The Go For It Programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Andrew Rough, originally from Yorkshire but now settled in Derry, has turned his passion for quality beer into a career after he discovered a gap in the market for locally produced, quality craft beers. Originally from Yorkshire, Andrew moved to Derry where he met his we and settled down. He soon discovered that the beer offering was limited compared with what he has been accustomed to in Yorkshire. Andrew said, “As a Yorkshire man, I am used to a really wide selection of beers, ales and stouts. But when I moved to Northern Ireland, the selection was limited to what I had been accustomed. I really struggled to find something dferent to the common mass-produced brands. “Over time, a few micro- breweries started to pop-up and that’s where the idea really started. I worked in the Walled City Brewery when it first opened. I loved seeing the process from grain to glass and I enjoyed seeing the look on people’s faces when they tasted something a little dferent to the usual offerings. Rough Brothers Brewing boasts an offering of five distinct products using only the finest, locally sourced grain in its brewing process. This includes an Oatmeal Stout, Northern Pale Ale and a bespoke beer, brewed exclusively for a local Asian street food inspired restaurant. Following the decision to open his own micro- brewery, Andrew knew what his business would offer, but lacked the business knowledge needed to put the idea into motion. googletag.cmd.push  Andrew Rought, from Rough Brothers Brewing, with Claire Costello, business adviser with Enterprise North West for Derry City and Strabane District Council.   That’s when he contacted the Go For It Programme to seek the professional support he needed to develop a detailed business plan to assist with turning his business idea into a reality. “I got to a stage when I knew that I wanted to go out on my own and put my twist on the newly revived micro-brewing industry, which was starting to really come into its own. I had an idea of what I wanted my business to look like and the types of products I would produce, but when it came to putting it together into a business, that’s where I needed help and contacted the Go For It Programme.”“I filled in the Go For It Programme online enquiry form and got speaking to my business advisor at Enterprise North West the next day. It was really quick and easy.“I knew what I wanted the business to look like, but I needed advice when it came to the legalities surrounding alcohol production, health and safety and insurance. The advice and support I received was fantastic. Everything was really clear and really helped me to take the next steps to realising my business dreams. “We developed a clear strategy for growth, which included opportunities I hadn’t even considered like the bespoke brewing offering which now makes up almost half of my business. The process of writing the business plan was fantastic. It really helped to cement the business idea and outlined clear goals, financial and otherwise, for the future.”The Go For It programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise. Claire Costello, business adviser, Enterprise North West for Derry City and Strabane District Council, said: “Supporting Andrew during the start-up stage of his business was a pleasure. He had a really vibrant and exciting business idea, which we helped him to fine-tune into a viable business opportunity.”“We assisted Andrew in the development of his business plan, which identied key milestones in his business le-cycle and potential future opportunities which could assist with the continued growth of his business. “Also included in the business plan was a full financial forecast, which allowed us to determine critical elements including unit selling price, the break-even point and investment requirements.“Andrew hit the market at a really good time, craft beer is having a real moment at present, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It is fantastic to see Andrew doing so well, with new stockists announced regularly. We look forward to seeing what the future holds for Andrew and Rough Brothers Brewing.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

We aim to meet these demands by providing a first-class experience in every aspect of their visit.Ardglass captain, Macartan Bryce, said the club is ldquohonoured to have received the award.He added: ldquoArdglass Golf Club is often praised on social media for the friendliness of its welcome and I believe this is down to not only the staff, but to the friendly reception that visitors receive from our members.Local councillor, Dermot Curran, has extended his congratulations to club officials in charge of the course in his home village.ldquoArdglass Golf Club is widely regarded as one of the best in Ireland and consistently attracts golfers from across the globe, he said.ldquoIt plays a key role in helping boost the local economy and I hope that additional visitor accommodation can been provided locally..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Baroness.jpg","title":"Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick ready to embrace House of Lords  ","story":"FORMER South Down MP Margaret Ritchie will formally take her place in the House of Lords on November .Several weeks ago she was appointed as a Member of the House, something that she regards as a ldquotremendous opportunity for her to re-engage with mainstream politics at a critical time.Her new title will be Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick, with the former MP explaining that she has chosen her title as it reflects the area where she was born, baptised, educated and spent most of her working le.Elected as a member of the former Down Council in , Miss Ritchie went on to become an MLA, Stormont Social Development Minister, SDLP leader and MP.Her appointment to the House of Lord opens a new chapter for her, one that she plans to embrace on behalf of all of the people of Northern Ireland.Baroness Ritchie firmly believes that where political chambers exist, people should be members of them to reflect the needs of communities across Northern Ireland. She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We hoped that their previous rejection of an Irish Sea border was based on principle rather than expediency.As they argued against Theresa May’s backstop, there were nagging suspicions that these Tories were more worried about its effects on the dream of a free-trading Britain than its impact on the Union. When Boris Johnson became prime minister, we fretted that he would drop even the flimsy, impermanent UK-wide safeguards negotiated by his predecessor, so that the rest of the country could do deals with the rest of the world. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button In the end, we’ve been misused by both of these fraudulent leaders and their backbench MPs. It’s true that May’s deal didn’t involve a tarf barrier in the Irish Sea, at least in the immediate future. But despite all the blandishments about her ‘precious Union’, she used Northern Ireland cynically, as an excuse to implement a close customs and regulatory relationship with the EU for the whole UK. Boris Johnson attacked her withdrawal agreement in uncompromising terms. After negotiating his own deal, he claimed he’d replaced the ‘undemocratic backstop’ with arrangements that protected the Union and maintained unfettered access for Northern Ireland to the market in Great Britain.There were many people, including unionists, who were prepared to believe him initially. Some of them even now ignore the text of his agreement and the fact that his claims have steadily fallen apart. Under detailed questioning, Tory ministers gave such hapless and uncertain answers, it was dficult to tell whether they were misrepresenting the deal deliberately or simply didn’t understand it. The government tried to deny or downplay several aspects of its agreement, only to admit later that they were accurate.We now know that Northern Irish businesses will have to pay tarfs up-front, in order to buy goods from Great Britain. They’ll have to fill-in expensive paperwork, to sell their goods on the mainland, and the government hasn’t done the sums, to work out how serious this burden will be. Research from the House of Commons’ library suggests we will pay VAT rates set in Dublin rather than London.The next parliament needs to radically improve its scrutiny of legacy plan Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"We could even be in a dferent time-zone to the rest of the country.And each of these capitulations and humiliations has been made to ensure that the small amount of trade we do with the Irish Republic can move without so much as an extra camera to track its progress. They’ve been conceded because two Tory governments have repeatedly refused to put the Irish nationalist grievance-machine, which has found new sponsors in Brussels, back in its box. No matter how suspicious many of us were about Boris Johnson’s intentions, we could not have foreseen that he’d be prepared to smash the Union so wantonly, so completely, to get what he wanted. This man, who accused his opponents of concocting a ‘surrender bill’ has conceived a spectacular surrender of his own.But let’s not pretend that the deal was purely the responsibility of Boris Johnson. For three years eurocrats, Dublin ministers, northern remainers and nationalists talked up the importance of a seamless Irish border and talked down the threat of checks at Irish Sea ports.They worked closely with representative organisations of retail, farming, manufacturing and other sectors, who gave this political message, which was explicitly hostile to unionism, credibility.We should have every sympathy with company owners, largely apolitical and focussed on keeping afloat, who are now discovering the costs of being cut off from their biggest market in Great Britain. The professional schmoozers who represent them should, for the most part, cringe with shame. They contributed to the idea that iding Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK could be accomplished with little dficulty. The DUP too, while it rightly opposes the deal now, made it possible by backing plans for an internal regulatory border. Remember, the party also gave its support to the joint report, back in , that formalised the idea of a backstop. And it accepted uncritically the hard-Brexiteers’ assurances that everything would be alright for Northern Ireland eventually, right up to the point when the betrayal was too blatant to ignore.The progress of Boris Johnson’s withdrawal bill will now be delayed, while the parties prepare to fight a December general election. The UK is unlikely to leave the EU until the st January , at the earliest, after Brussels granted another extension.Some of the DUP’s former allies in the ERG assert that the intervening time will be spent pursuing a better deal for NI. Their claims should be treated with utter contempt. The Conservatives will be fighting this election on the basis that Johnson has delivered a good deal for Britain. Many voters, who want to ‘get Brexit done’, agree and the complaints of Ulster unionists are unlikely to change their minds. I hear some Tory MPs are briefing local supporters that the least palatable aspects of the agreement will be resolved before the transition period ends in December . They expect us to believe that the EU, to date intractable and determined, will suddenly prove pliable and pragmatic, when it comes to soothing Northern Ireland’s anxieties over the next year.How stupid do they think we are try catch  TrendingEssex Police hunt N.I. brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailerCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In Facebookrsquos earnings conference call mdash which began less than an hour after Mr Dorseyrsquos tweet mdash Mr Zuckerberg issued an impassioned monologue about what he called Facebookrsquos deep belief ldquothat political speech is important and stood by the companyrsquos decision to run unchecked political ads. He denied this choice is financially motivated, saying such ads make up less than half of a per cent of the companyrsquos revenue.To put that in perspective, he added, Facebookrsquos recent five billion dollars Federal Trade Commission fine was more than  times that. ldquoThis is complex stuff. Anyone who says the answer is simple hasnrsquot thought about the nuances and downstream challenges, he said. ldquoI donrsquot think anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or we havenrsquot thought hard about these issues. A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.mdash jack ###October , The issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter, along with Facebook and Google, refused to remove a misleading video ad from US president Donald Trumprsquos campaign that targeted former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate.In response, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, another presidential hopeful, ran an ad on Facebook taking aim at Mr Zuckerberg. The ad ly claimed that Mr Zuckerberg endorsed Mr Trump for re-election, acknowledging the deliberate hood as necessary to make a point.A final note. This isnrsquot about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has signicant ramications that todayrsquos democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. Itrsquos worth stepping back in order to address.mdash jack ###October , Critics have called on Facebook to ban all political ads. This includes CNN chief Jeff Zucker, who recently called the policy of allowing lies ludicrous and advised the social media giant to sit out the  election until it can figure out something better.Google did not have immediate comments on Twitterrsquos policy change.Twitter currently only allows certied campaigns and organisations to run political ads for candidates and issues. The latter tend to advocate on broader issues such as climate change, abortion rights and immigration.The company said it will make some exceptions, such as allowing ads that encourage voter turnout. It will describe those in a detailed policy it plans to release on November .Twitterrsquos policy will start on November .Mr Trumprsquos campaign manager called Twitterrsquos change a ldquovery dumb decision in a statement on Wednesday.ldquoThis is yet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever, campaign manager Brad Parscale said.The presidential campaign for Mr Biden said it was ldquounfortunate that companies would think the only option was to completely ban political ads.ldquoWhen faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out, Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for Mr Bidenrsquos campaign said in a statement..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Twitter bans all political advertisements article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
