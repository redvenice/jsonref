While the British cap for auto-enrolment fees is higher, at 0.75 per cent, a state-backed operator there charges 0.3 per cent annually on the value of a pension pot.The Government has argued there are fees that bring this rate up. Dr Laura Bambrick, head of social policy with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said the cap was “generous”, and called for it to be lowered. “The 0.5 per cent maximum management fee is excessive. The cap is a good idea but it has to be reduced,” she said.Dr Barra Roantree, an economist with the Economic and Social Research Institute whose work focuses on taxation, welfare and pensions, said “a difference of 0.2 per cent in fees makes a huge difference compounded over the lifetime (of investment) – they look small, but over decades they really matter”. He said higher management charges “would mean savers keeping less of their pension pot, especially if their investments yield a high return”. He said the difference could potentially amount to tens of thousands. “It depends on the size of the funds, but it really does add up. It sounds small, but it is large, and particularly for guys who might not have a huge fund,” he said.“What’s crucial is that those automatically enrolled are given access to a product with the lowest possible fees,” he said. UK schemeThe Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection defended the scheme, saying it would not be accurate to say investors in the UK scheme would only pay 0.3 per cent in fees. It argued there were other fees levied by the British equivalent plan, including a fee of 1.8 per cent on contributions. Jerry Moriarty, chief executive of the Irish Association of Pension Funds, said overall the fee structures were “broadly equivalent” due to the charges made on contributions into the British scheme. The department said it was anticipated that fees charged would ultimately come in below the cap. It said it was important for participants, employers and the State that its scheme costs are kept low and transparent.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"social media directors could be liable for allowing harm under new proposals","story":"Minister for Culture and Media Catherine Martin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSenators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells met Ms Martin yesterday to press the case for amendments to a draft Bill published earlier this year which would take the radical step of opening the directors to criminal sanctions for failing to police their platforms. Mr Byrne said the Minister signalled she agreed with amendments he intends to table to strengthen the Bill’s provisions when it comes to the Seanad. The Minister’s spokesman confirmed that she was open to taking amendments, adding: “All sides agreed they were trying to achieve the same objective.”The online safety and media commission legislation is due to be considered by the Oireachtas in the coming months. It will regulate social media giants, enabling a new commission which will have powers to levy them with substantial fines. However, online safety campaigners want to toughen the proposed legislation, which they say does not go far enough.‘Game-changer’The proposal to make directors personally criminally liable would be, its promoters say, a “game-changer” for regulating the social media companies. They say it would be similar to health and safety legislation, which allows directors of companies to be prosecuted for breaches of the law. They say that the social media companies, with their vast profits, simply do not regard fines as a significant punishment or deterrent.“If companies can simply write off fines as business costs, as we have arguably seen in the case of some data breaches, then we know that they are not going to take fines for the consequences of online harm seriously,” Senator Byrne said.“If, however, company directors are made criminally liable for where they knowingly and recklessly allow online harms to be developed or perpetuated, then there will be change in attitude.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics ivana bacik on labour s past present and future","story":"Ivana Bacik’s uncontested election as Labour Party leader came after the swift removal of Alan Kelly from the role and her own relatively recent appointment as a TD in the Dublin Bay South by-election.

He’s back on the yolks.The Minister for Agriculture was at his shoulder. Maybe the boss shouldn’t be imparting this sort of information willy-nilly, we said to him. Some people, particularly younger folk, might get the wrong end of the glowstick. Then again, they might start seeing the Taoiseach in a new light.Charlie McConalogue just laughed. Micheál wanted to set the record straight following our stunning scoop yesterday that he nudges the yolks out of halved boiled eggs in the Dáil canteen and only puts the white bits on his plate.He was not disputing the veracity of this insightful information in any way. This used to be the way he rolled. But not any more.“They contain a thing called choline,” he explained. “Very good for brain function.”So the Taoiseach is enthusiastically back on the yolks now. Or have we just hallucinated the whole episode? A distinct possibility, given that one of the main highlights of a dull afternoon in Leinster House was the installation of a swanky new sparkling water dispenser in the canteen. It provides still water, too.Micheál will be beside himself.In the Dáil, the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader were absorbed in another instalment of their endless argument about housing. He wants a “solutions”-focused approach. She wants a “reality”-focused approach. And ne’er the twain shall meet, it seems.Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats took up where Mary Lou McDonald left off and talked about the Government’s newly launched pension auto-enrolment scheme. “While welcoming plans to address the pension time-bomb, we have a housing time-bomb that exploded years ago,” she told Micheál.It would be a great idea if it didn’t look suspiciously like a wheeze to get workers priced out of the property market to put their money into a pension fund which they can then use to cover the rent they will still have to pay in their retirement years, she reckoned.Is this the real reason the Government is introducing this plan for workers in the private sector? “So they can raid the pension fund to continue to pay rack rents when they reach their mid-60s,” she said.Getting realThe Taoiseach sounded frustrated. He wished people would welcome this plan in the spirit in which it was intended. “There can be no argument against doing the right thing,” he responded. “It’s the right thing to do.”Despite Opposition TDs mentioning media reports to the contrary, he stressed there was no sinister motive underpinning the measure. He was “somewhat taken aback” by the commentary on the auto-enrolment scheme, something he had believed most TDs would welcome.The main reason behind it is to do something about the dearth of pension cover in the private sector, he said, adding that he was “delighted” his government has moved to tackle the issue.Murphy was not against improving people’s pension prospects but she feared a generation of people, struggling now to pay rent and with no prospect of owning a home when they retire, would be forced to spend that extra pension money just to keep the roof over their heads. She argued that the answer was not just about building more houses, but to build more houses that workers could afford to buy.Micheál didn’t disagree, but it was a case of trying to build them fast enough. “I know I annoy people when I say it: we do need to get real in terms of delivering housing schemes much faster than we are. Everybody needs to get real.”What is the point in coming into the Dáil every week “having a go, saying this is a great crisis, this is terrible, government is not doing enough” while carrying on as usual in councils around the country?” he asked Opposition TDs. “No problem – we can object to that, we can amend that, we can change that. And yet you come in here attacking, attacking, attacking. That’s not going to wash any more.”As for the auto-enrolment scheme, it is designed to give “pension coverage to workers in our society that supplements the State pension and will enable them to have a quality of life in their later years. That’s it.”“Not if they can’t pay their rent,” shot back Richard Boyd Barrett.Ukraine crisisLater in the afternoon, the Dáil set aside 3½ hours for deputies to make statements on the crisis in Ukraine. Most of them making, more or less, the same speech.Mary Lou McDonald repeated her call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador. His Execrably Mr Yura Fibbertov is still ensconced in Rathgar telling porkies for the motherland, but the Government is reluctant to boot out any more diplomats after expelling four alleged spooks on Tuesday.Russia immediately signalled it would indulge in tit-for-tatski retaliation that will probably see the expulsion of four of the six Irish diplomats in Moscow, where Ireland is anxious to maintain some presence.Fine Gael backbencher Joe Carey, looking ahead to Thursday’s address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to both Houses of the Oireachtas, suggested that arrangements be put in place broadcast the speech on big screens in towns and cities across the country.The Clare TD reckoned Merrion Square Park across from Leinster House would be an ideal location in Dublin “and we would encourage Ukrainian people, people who are living here, and refugees, to attend and we can all stand with Ukraine and its people on the day.”Meanwhile, the Oireachtas pulsated with fervent apathy from 11am when counting began in the Seanad byelection for Ivana Bacik’s vacant seat on the Trinity College panel.What with sorting the ballots, each one contained in an envelope within an envelope, and getting them in the right piles and stuff, it was after 7pm when the actual first count got under way.TDs and Senators, voracious political animals all, clean forgot to rush down the road to Trinity to follow the action as it rattled along like a tortoise with gout.Bacik, whose election to the Dáil last year gave rise to the vacancy, called into the count centre to wish the Labour candidate well while managing not to look ecstatic at escaping the backwater of the Upper House.The Seanad election process is fiendishly complicated to overcompensate for the dodgy nature of the rotten borough system that yields up our senators. Hopeless political anoraks who can’t resist any sort of election count were predicting that it could be late into Thursday night or even Friday morning before a winner is declared. Sure we’ll have burst entirely with the excitement by then. We might need some of Micheál’s yolks to keep going."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of

biodegradable packaging save recycling says government","story":"Compostable and biodegradable packaging should be put in the bin because there is little evidence it is good for compost and it can contaminate recycling, the Government has said.“Do not recycle” labels must be added to all compostable and biodegradable packaging, under new rules to be introduced by the Government, which said such products should be thrown in the bin.The new rules signal a change in policy from the Government, which as recently as last year said it wanted all packaging to be “recyclable, reusable or compostable” by 2025.Recycling is contaminated if it includes compostable or biodegradable packaging, which cannot be turned into new materials.Even when properly broken down in industrial composting facilities, there is insufficient evidence that compostable packaging provides “ecological or agricultural benefits to soils or digestate” when it is turned into compost, the Government has said.“Until the infrastructure and evidence base can be improved, compostable and biodegradable packaging must have the ‘do not recycle’ label applied,” it said.It recommended that such products be thrown in the bin, and said it would only change its advice if there is further evidence compostable products add “benefit to soils and land”.The change is included in the Government’s consultation on making packaging producers pay for tackling waste and comes ahead of the introduction of a new plastic tax on Friday, which will penalise companies that use products with less than 30 per cent recycled material.Compostable and biodegradable coffee machine pods, takeaway containers and delivery packaging have grown in popularity in recent years, as companies respond to consumer concerns over the impact of single use plastics.But experts warn of greenwashing, and say the labelling of plastics as compostable or biodegradable can lead to unintentional littering because people believe they will fully disintegrate if they are thrown out.Many biodegradable products do not break down fully when left in the open air and leave microplastic residue.Compostable packaging is designed to break down in specific circumstances and most do not break down in home composting facilities.They can be broken down in industrial facilities via food and garden waste, but not all councils have access, and even when they are turned into compost, there is little evidence that they add nutrients to the final products.Meanwhile, around half of councils send their green waste to anaerobic digestion, where it is processed and turned into biogas and fertiliser, and which cannot process the plastic.“Compostable packaging materials are not widely targeted, collected or processed as part of normal council waste services in the UK because many of these types of packaging don’t perform as advertised when treated in real-world conditions at industrial composting facilities,” said Jacob Hayler, the executive director of the Environmental Services Association, which represents the waste industry.“In many cases, packaging and other objects are screened out before householders’ garden and food waste is sent for composting anyway and are treated as general rubbish.”He added: “Brands should carefully consider any introduction of compostable or biodegradable packaging to the market in the context of the UK’s waste management infrastructure which, at present, is largely not able to put these materials to good use.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin hunting for cyber

The Met Police announced yesterday it would hand out  fixed penalty noticesto people who attended parties in Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid lockdowns. Scotland Yard warned more fines could be dished out in future - with Boris Johnsonaposs own situation still hanging in the balance. Tory ministers gave police the power to hand out FPNs from they reasonably believed someone had committed an offence.And Justice Secretary Dominic Raab today accepted the  people fined over Partygate had broken the law. The Deputy PM said: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices.Keir Starmer suggested Boris Johnson had lied to Parliament when he said all guidance was followed in No.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view yesterday, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today, No stood by that line in a toe-curling briefing to journalists. We have reproduced a large segment of it below. To spare our sanity, and yours, weaposve not included every single question. The questions are from ious journalists and the answers are interchangeable from the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman and his Press Secretary. Does the PM agree with Dominic Raab that breaches of the regulations are the only thing that could warrant fixed penalty notices  “The Prime Minister said he respects the position of the Met, equally that this investigation is ongoing… you will hear more from him at the conclusion.”He respects the position - does he agree with it  “As I say, my position hasn’t changed from yesterday”.He doesn’t agree with Dominic Raab on that then, who explicitly said rules were broken and the law was broken  That’s something you wouldn’t bring yourself to say yesterday. Are you still maintaining that position, or do you agree with the Justice Secretary  “We are maintaining that position”.So you disagree with the Justice Secretary on whether the law has been broken  “You’ve got my position from yesterday - it hasn’t changed.”Isn’t the Justice Secretary, being the Justice Secretary, in quite a good position to determine whether the law has been broken or not  “As I say, there is an ongoing process here. The Met have come to a conclusion and started a process which relates to  fines and we fully respect that. What I’m saying is you will hear more from the Prime Minister at the conclusion of that process, rather than in the middle of it.Given the PM and No clearly disagree with what the Justice Secretary said this morning, is he going to be having a word  “I wouldn’t characterise it like that… we respect the process but the investigation is not complete and we want to wait until the investigation is complete before commenting on that.”So you do agree with the Justice Secretary then  “All I’m saying is…”It’s one or other isn’t it  Either you agree with him or you don’t  “Our position on this hasn’t changed. We respect the process and there is an ongoing investigation so we need to wait for that to complete.”Did the Justice Secretary mis-speak  “He’s been setting out the view, the Met have set out their view, and we respect the conclusions they have come to. But I’m saying we will not be commenting further on the detail of what happened until the investigation is complete.”But you don’t respect it, do you  Because you’re saying you don’t accept that rules were broken  “That’s not what we’re saying. We’re saying we respect what the Met are saying, but as the PM said today, an investigation is still ongoing and there are not further details at this point so we need to wait for the investigation to complete in order to comment further.”In these  cases, they are complete. Does the PM accept in these  cases, the law was broken  It’s concluded. There’s nothing  to say. “And of course we accept that, the Met are independent, they’re making decisions as they go throughout this investigation which remains a live investigation. It would not be right for me to give the Prime Minister’s view in the midst of an ongoing police investigation.”Isn’t this actually about the fact thatthe Prime Minister himself gets a fine, you don’t want to have to concede he’s broken the law  “Well, we talked about that hypothetical situation before. We will come forward and confirm thatit were to happen and of course you’d hear from the Prime Minister.” Why is it dficult for you to comment on the  cases  Have the Met said anything to you about that, asking you not to  “It’s a clearof the fact there is an ongoing Met Police investigation and we want to comment once that has concluded, not in the midst of it. And obviously the Met have set out their process where they are issuing  fines and they’ve said they may be going further, so we are not going to comment in the midst of that, but we respect the Met’s process.Why do you think the Lord Chancellor has a dferent view on whether you can comment on the  cases at this point  “You’ve asked our position, we’ve set it out.”Can you see why the position is a bit surreal from where we stand  The police are saying the law has been broken, the Justice Secretary who oversees laws is saying the law has been broken, but you won’t say the law has been broken. We don’t quite understand why you’re adopting that very strange position. “Well look, I think people will understand that… we wouldn’t be commenting during a live police investigation. We are maintaining that position that we set out. The Prime Minister commissioned both the Sue Gray inquiry that has led onto this, and we want to allow that to conclude in full before commenting in detail. In general terms, does the government believe a person who has been handed a fixed penalty notice has committed an offence  “I’m not debating what happens when an inidual receives a fixed penalty notice, and we’ve talked about some of the processes around that.”Sorry,you’re not debating it, what are you saying happensan inidual is handed a fixed penalty  “I’m simply saying I’m not going to be commenting in the midst of an ongoing investigation.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyScotland Yardpolitan PolicePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite the fixed penalty notices confirming rules were breached, the Prime Minister has so far refused to accept laws were broken. Giving evidence to MPs on the Commonsapos Liaison Committee, the PM was repeatedly pressed to accept the Metaposs findings, but would not. But, asked about the Partygate scandal on Thursday, Trade Secretary Ms Trevelyan said the Prime Minister wants to wait until the whole process of the police review has been done before making any comment.She said, however, that the politan Police’s decision to issue  fines linked to the Partygate scandal meant coronavirus lockdown laws were broken in Whitehall.AskedJustice Secretary Dominic Raab misspoke on Wednesday when he said there were clear breaches of the law, she told Sky News: “No, he is the Justice Secretary and he has set out a position.“I thinkyou or I get a fine, we hopefully pay it and move on from there. And I hope, and I assume, that those who have been fined by the police will pay their fines and that will be the punishment that they have accepted.” Pressed on whether  fines being issued meant there were  instances of people breaking the law, she said: “Well, that’s right. They’ve broken the regulations that were set in the Covid Act, and police deem that that was what they did and therefore they’ve been fined accordingly.” Asked why the PM would not say this, she said: “Because, as I say, he wants to wait until the whole process of the police review has been done.” Mr Johnson dodged questions about his futurehe is found to have broken coronavirus laws, when he gave evidence to MPs on Wednesday. SNP MP Pete Wishart suggested the Prime Minister would be “toast”he was hit with a fine.Mr Johnson said: “I don’t in any way wish to minimise the importance of the issue and your point but I just want toto what I have said and that is: that would come under the category of running commentary, in my view.” Pressed on whether he had broken the ministerial code and whether that would be a resignation issue, Mr Johnson said: “I think you’re just going to have to hold your horses and wait until the conclusion of the investigation when there will be a lot more clarity and I will be back before this committee and, I have no doubt, before the body of the House of Commons.” Former Runrig musician Mr Wishart said: “I was in rock and roll for  years, I could never even start to compete and keep up with activities in No  during lockdown and the partying culture you created.” Mr Johnson said: “Your question is a very good illustration of why it is important that we should wait until the conclusion of the investigation.” The fines handed out by cops are thought to be the first tranche, with more to come in the weeks ahead. Scotland Yard is investigating  parties in total, a number of which the PM is reported to have been at. Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray has also compiled an in-depth report into the Partygate allegations. Her interim report, released before the Met began investigating, found there were failures of leadership and judgment in No and excessive consumption of alcohol that was not appropriate in a professional workplace.

While MPs are encouraged to use public transport, their parking has been free since at least , and Parliament has an underground car park. MPs and their staff can also claim parking for work in their constituency on expenses, with  such claims totalling nearly £, paid out last year.And senior ministers such as Chancellor Rishi Sunak or Health Secretary Sajid Javid can be chauffeured in taxpayer-funded ministerial cars. It comes after Mr Javid announced NHS staff free parking introduced as a result of Covid will end. Parking fees were waived in March  - but Mr Javid said the pandemic had moved to a new stage.  Rachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said: “If itaposs good enough for MPs then it should be good enough for NHS workers. “Our members will be appalled by the hypocrisy of Ministers pushing this through who enjoy free parking at their own place of work. “Nurses, cleaners, porters and more have run themselves into the ground keeping people alive during this pandemic. Now we’ve got the worst cost of living crisis for a generation. “Health workers need help and support to stop them either leaving the profession or burning out. “Instead they’re getting a real terms pay cut and car parking charges - this is not levelling up, this is a downright disgrace.” Union chiefs warned NHS staff face a multi million pound car parking bill from Friday. The GMB said official figures for the financial year   - the year before charges were lted for the pandemic - showed that health workers paid £. million in car parking fees.Unison and Labour warned the charges could trigger resignations.The union’s head of health Sara Gorton said: “This is no way for the NHS to hang on to staff in the current job market. “Parking charges will add hundreds of pounds to the massive cost pressures already facing health staff and reduce their morale even further. “Those already on the brink of leaving the NHS may well see this as the final straw and head for the exit. Keir Starmer ’s spokesman added: It seems a very odd way to thank NHS staff for their efforts over the pandemic, to increase the cost of living crisis and take away free hospital parking at this time.“This could be yet one more thing that forces people to quit roles that we need to boost. Figures from before  suggested around half of MPs had a permit to park on the Parliamentary estate. But parking is not guaranteed for Parliament’s staff, who can only applythey have to be on the estate at overnight or have a ersity-related need. Free parking for NHS staff was already being scaled back in the wake of the pandemic. St Thomas’ Hospital - opposite Parliament on the other bank of the Thames - charges £. an hour for the public, and much less for staff. Staff who drive to the central London hospital pay a “competitive” £. to £. for a whole sht. However, they are only eligible for free parking while working nights. A spokesperson for the hospital Trust said: “Otherwise, we encourage staff to use public transport, cycle or walk to our central London site, where possible.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman defended the move, saying: “You’ll know we took that approach at the height of the pandemic and clearly that comes with a cost to the taxpayer. We are ing to the pre-pandemic position.”The spokesman pointed to the Tory election pledge to give free parking to blue-badge holders people with long-term health conditions parents of sick children staying overnight and staff on night shts. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said % of NHS Trusts are implementing free parking for those who need it most.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.” British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jamie Wallis, the Tory MP for Bridgend in south Wales since , shared the news in a statement in the early hours today. The statement on Dr Wallisapos website said: I’m trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be. I’ve been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I’ve felt this way since I was a very young child. I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. The MP went on: Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. Well, I’m not. Dr Wallis was praised by campaigners and MP colleagues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who last night made a joke about trans issues in a speech to MPs, said at PMQs: The House stands with you and will give you the support you need to live freely as yourself. Keir Starmer echoed his comments. The PM tweeted: Sharing this very intimate story would have taken an immense amount of courage. Thank you @JamieWallisMP for your bravery, which will undoubtedly support others. The Conservative Party I lead will always give you, and everyone , the love and support you need to be yourself. Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss wrote: Well done Jamie Wallis for speaking out and your brave statement. We stand with you. Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis. As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you. I hope that your brave statement will help others. Dr Wallis later posted an update saying: “I am overwhelmed by the kindness and support I have received in the last few hours.“I am proud to be completely open and honest about the struggles I have had, and continue to have, with my identity.“However, I remain the same person I was yesterday. For the time being, I will continue to present as I always have and will use he him his pronouns.”Conservative Tom Tugendhat said this is a very brave statement, while Labouraposs Angela Eagle tweeted: This is very brave. Look after yourself and take the time you need to recover. Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: Dear Jamie I wish you all the very best. Colleagues across the House will respect your openness honesty and the journey you are on. Cwtch.Benjamin Cohen, the chief executive of Pink News, added: This is truly groundbreaking, the UK’s first MP to share that they are trans. The LGBT+ Conservatives group tweeted: Asking for help  seeking comfort in those around you isn’t always easy. The group told the MP it was also in your support network - and are always here to support you whenever you need. You’ve always been there for us, now it’s our turn. In the online post Dr Wallis said he had been a victim of separate crimes of blackmail and rape, after which things have really taken a tumble adding: I am not OK. The MP wrote: There was a close call in April  when someone Blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members. He wanted £, to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked. He pled guilty and was sentenced to yrs and mnths in prison. After describing an incident of rape, the MP went on: I have not been myself since this incident and I don’t think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from. Dr Wallis was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit after colliding into a lamp post in November. In the overnight web statement, the MP wrote: I fled the scene. I did so because I was terried. I have PTSD and I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear. I am sorry that it appears I aposran awayapos but this isn’t how it happened in the moment.The MP praised the support of colleagues and Conservative whips, after Boris Johnson hosted a dinner for Tory MPs at a London hotel. According to reports, the Prime Minister opened his speech with a joke saying: Good evening ladies and gentleman, or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.However, Dr Wallis wrote: Tonight, I was reminded of the incredible support those you work with can provide. Also, I was reminded how important it is to be yourself. I have never lived my truth and I’m not sure how. Perhaps it starts with telling everyone. Trans rights, and how to describe trans people, have become a topic of bitter debate in Westminster.In , ministers scrapped plans to make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender after campaigners raised concerns about biological sex and the preservation of women-only spaces.Trans people still need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, evidence they have lived in their assumed gender for two years, agreement from their spouse, and to have their bid approved by a  of medics and judges. Human rights groups and LGBT rights group Stonewall condemned the government for falling far short on its promise of reform. Boris Johnson last week said the issue requires extreme sensitivity, tact, love and care. We must recognise that when people want to make a transition in their lives, they should be treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect. We have systems in this country that allow that and have done for a long time, and we should be very proud of that, but I want to say in addition that I think, when it comes to distinguishing between a man and a woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important. Boris Johnson’s Press Secretary twice refused to sayhe regretted his joke about trans people, instead telling journalists: “You’ve heard him direct Jamie directly”. Askedhe stood by his comments on the biology of gender the Press Secretary said: “Yes, you’ve heard him say that before.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said the UK didnapost want people in rubber boats, referring to rising numbers of people making the perilous Channel crossing in dinghies. More than , people have been brought to the UK since the start of the year, according to figures collated by the PA news agency. The comments came as the Prime Minister was grilled by the powerful Commons Liaison Committee over the plight of Ukrainian refugees. Sir Bill urged the prime minister to look at the other “end of the spectrum,” telling him: “We have, on at least three occasions, promised the Qataris visa-free access. “These are very wealthy people who are unlikely to stay. And yet, despite saying we do it three times, we still haven’t delivered.” The North Herefordshire MP said he was worried the PM wasnapost delivering on his promises, adding: The only people who are turning up are turning up in rubber boats. Why canapost we get the right people through our immigration system, rather than the wrong ones  Mr Johnson pressed him to clary, to which the MP replied: We want Ukrainians, we want Qataris, we donapost want people in rubber boats. The PM said the new Nationality and Borders Bill would help to end the cruel trading in people across the Channel. The controversial legislation is expected to penalise people seeking asylum in the UK.  He also promised a much more fluid system for Qatar and said he had told the Emir of Qatar that progress was likely on the issue. Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael blasted Sir Bill for playing Top Trumps with people. He told the Mirror: It must be comforting to be a Conservative MP who thinks people can so easily be sorted into aposrightapos and aposwrongapos. But the real world is a bit more complicated than that. The truth is, the Conservatives have given us a broken immigration system that stops UK employers recruiting the people they need - no matter which country they come from. The Governmentaposs two tier approach is wrong both practically and on principle.Instead of playing Top Trumps with peopleaposs nationality, we need an immigration system that works for our economy and treats everyone with dignity and respect. The PM came under pressure during the hearing over the chaotic response to the spiralling Ukrainian refugee crisis. More than  million people have fled the Russian onslaught, according to UN estimates.Only , Ukrainian refugees have been put up by Brits under the Homes for Ukrainescheme despite more than , families offering to help.Some , people have applied for a visa, the government confirmed on Tuesday. The separate scheme for refugees with family links to the UK has had , applicants, with the Home Office issuing , visas.

Tracey Connelly, now , shocked the world with her horric crimes against her -month-old son Peter were revealed during her court case. She was jailed at the Old Bailey in  for causing or allowing the death of little Peter at their home in Tottenham, north London, on August , .Known publicly as Baby P, Peter Connelly had suffered more than  injuries at the hands of her partner Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen over an eight-month period. This was despite the youngster being on the at-risk register and receiving  visits from social workers, police and health professional during the same period.Now Connelly has been granted release on licence for the second time.She had been released in  but was locked up again two years later after breaking the terms of her parole by selling indecent photographs of herself online.Last year it was reported Connelly may have to agree to undergo lie ­detector tests to prove she is not reoffending. The Parole Board considered her case for a third time in  following previous reviews in  and , and refused to either release her or move her to an open prison.  In  she lost an appeal against the latest Parole Board decision not to release her. Today the Parole Board agreed to her release - once again on licence - and subject to six strict conditions: . Sleep at her home address, be of good behaviour and turn up to supervision appointments . Wear an electronic tag and reveal any relationships . Do not contact victims or children .

Professional assessment at the time considered this to have been effective and MsConnelly was released on the direction of the Parole Board. After she was sent to prison for a second time the report adds: A further professional assessment determined that the work Ms Connelly had completed prior to her release had been insufficient to reduce her level of risk. It went on: The  heard that Ms Connelly had now spent over two and a half years on the regime and had done well. Evidence was presented to show that she was using her new skills and that she was now able to work openly and honestly with professionals.

The bride, groom and best man were all arrested after the bride attacked her own mother at the reception in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland. The mayhem began when Claire Goodbrand, , violently attacked and injured her mum Cherry-Ann Lindsay, erupting into a large scuffle where the groom and best man weighed in. New husband Eamonn Goodbrand and his brother Kieran, their best man, joined the fracas, viciously assaulting wedding guest David Boyd and leaving him severely injured, a court has heard. The best man also attacked and injured another guest before police arrived to break-up the brawl.Officers took the wedding party trio away in cuffs and were remanded in custody in separate cells before appearing in court, the Daily Record reports.When they were finally released from custody Claire was wearing what appeared to be her going-away outfit while the groom and best man were dressed in prison-issue Primark tracksuits, still wearing their mud-stained wedding shoes. Professional fighter Eamonn, , who was sporting a head injury when he was freed, gave an address in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, as did his -year-old we and his -year-old brother. CCTV footage which reportedly captured the fight spilling out of the wedding venue onto the lawn outside, persuaded the trio’s legal team to negotiate guilty pleas to a reduced number of charges at Livingston Sherf Court. Claire Goodbrand pled guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury. She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing.  Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury. In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew. Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight. It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVWeddingsCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He dropped the grey mask as he left a house in Dawlish, after ransacking it and stealing £, worth of jewellery, including an engagement and an eternity ring which were of huge sentimental value. Nash went on to burgle two other houses in the area which were both empty because their elderly owners had recently moved into care homes.One had CCTV installed which provided images of him and he left distinctive prints from his Hugo Boss designer boots which showed he was the same man as carried out the first burglary. Police traced him to his home in Wales, but he was released under investigation - after which he carried out a fourth raid on a house in Rhyl in December, stealing £, worth of jewellery. Nash, , from Kinmel Bay, North Wales, pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary and was jailed for four years by Judge Timothy Rose at Exeter Crown Court. Reports say Nash - who has a long record of  prior convictions including seven domestic burglaries - was on holiday in Devon when he carried out the spree. He visited the area after finishing a sentence at a Welsh prison for thieving £,-worth of jewellery.  Defending the repeat offender, Mr Greg Richardson said his partner suffers from mental health conditions, including a personality disorder and possible schizophrenia. In mitigation, the court heard how Nash is working for an engineering firm as a machine operator. A reference from his employer was also read. Nash was remanded into custody as Judge Paul Cook adjourned the case for a drug worker to compile a report about the causes of the -year-oldaposs reoffending. Judge Cook said: I will adjourn this case for a report but he needs to understand that it will go to theof sentence rather than the manner of disposal.

Lee, , and Linzi Steer, , collect spooky dolls but believe this one is a aposmysteryapos after it was sent to them with no note explaining its background - leaving the duo uncertain what could be lurking in its history. The married couple ed to their haunted objects museum in Rotherham last Friday to find the donated Victorian doll had inexplicably moved positions on its shelf. Lee, , claims the baffling CCTV footage shows the toy slowly lean forward in a controlled motion before its head tilts slightly and said he has not seen anything like it in  years as a real-le ghost hunter.When the pair shared the footage on the doll aposmoving like a humanapos on social media, other paranormal fans claimed it looks like a aposchild is hugging itapos. Linzi, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said: This particular doll didnapost come to us as haunted. People sent it but didnapost particularly tell us what [had happened with her]. Usually theyaposll leave us notes but with this doll, it was nothing. It was a mystery. We went in on Friday and we both noticed that doll propped forward. I said aposletaposs just check CCTVapos. No one ever goes in. Itaposs just me, Lee and Leeaposs mum that have keys. We had to go right back to Tuesday [on the cameras] then Lee went aposoh my godapos.  The doll moves forward in three stages then its head moves. It turns its head - itaposs like the joints are physically moving like a human. It was propped like that. If it was a natural fall itaposd have gone on the floor, but it didnapost. The way she was positioned defies gravity. That doll is actually heavy and it was leant at an angle. This footage is the first time weaposve caught something moving on camera at the museum. It baffles me. Iaposm actually sceptical but I canapost explain it. Lee and Linzi, who run Project Reveal Ghosts of Britain, put the footage online for their followers and claim the majority thought it looked like a ghost child was playing with the doll.  Linzi said: There were a lot of people saying the footage looks real. The main thing people talk about is the actual joints moving. We put it online and  percent of them said it looked like a spirit child is wanting to hug the doll. A lot of people who come to our museum do pick up on children there. Itaposs very weird. If there is something attached to the doll, we want to work with it. Weaposve got  rooms of dferent things. [The property] used to be three minersapos houses but now its our museum, a cafe and a little shop. We know itaposs been a lot of things in its time but recorded details is that there were two children badly neglected in there. There is documentation of another child that was burnt and scolded to death.  The couple open their museum up to private parties and paranormal investigators - with their website claiming they have aposfive of the top  most haunted items to ever existapos on display there. Linzi said: We own a haunted objects museum and every weekend thereaposs someone in investigating there. This museum has haunted items from all over the world that people send us and the house itself is very haunted. We go down there after a teamaposs been in to make sure the house is okay. Weaposve got a lot of dolls and people send them to us. They might think thereaposs something strange about them, some think theyaposre haunted. We must have more than  dolls. These particular ones on the shelf are very old. Weaposve got one thataposs dated from the s. Weaposve even got an old morgue table downstairs. Lee said: Iaposve been doing this for over  years and Iaposve never seen anything like that. It definitely shocked me.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that tests will no longer be free for the vast majority of the British public, meaning they will have to paythey want to test under the new plans.But the government announced today that a small number of groups will be able to still access the tests for free. Evensomeone is symptomatic they will no longer be told to test, instead urged to isolate until the symptoms pass. From April , the tests are being massively scaled back as apart of the final stage of the government’s plan to live with Covid. However, some people will still have access even after universal testing ends.  On top of this, the government did specy thata new iant of concern emerges then it could be expanded once more. After Friday, the groups who will still have access to free lateral flow tests, when they are asymptomatic, are: • Patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned healthcare providers • Staff in hospices and adult social care services • A small number of care home visitors who provide personal care • Staff in some prisons and places of detention • Staff in high-risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settingsThen, for people who have symptoms, more groups will still have access to testing whilst symptomatic. This will include: • Certain hospital patients who need access to treatments and ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants. • People who are otherwise eligible for community Covid treatments as they are more vulnerable,• And people discharged from hospitals into care homes and similar settings.During an outbreak accessibility to asymptomatic testing will be expanded further. This will go on to include residential special needs and disability schools, and care home staff and residents. Whilst the above will have access to tests when asymptomatic, there are plans in place to make sure free tests are available for some with Covid symptoms. From now on, people who have symptoms, instead of testing, should try to stay home and avoid contact with other people until any symptoms pass. This includes school children.  Mr Javid said: Thanks to our plan to tackle COVID, we are leading the way in learning to live with the virus. We have made enormous progress but will keep the ability to respond to future threats including potential iants. Vaccines remain our best defence and we are now offering spring boosters to the elderly, care home residents and the most vulnerable - please come forward to protect yourself, your family, and your community. One of the reasons the government withdrew the testing programme, as well as believing the country had progressed past the need for such surveillance, was due to the heavy costs. The government said free testing, tracing and isolation cost more than £. billion over the past two years.

Sources revealed the Duke of York has been accused of manipulating his positionThe Queen walked into the church with Prince Andrew Image: POOL AFP via Getty ImagesByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar  The Queen defiantly overruled heirs Prince Charles and Prince William to allow her disgraced son Andrew to have a special role at the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service, it can be revealed.The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge “on more than one occasion” raised their concerns over the optics of allowing the shamed Duke of York to accompany his mother to the Westminster Abbey service on Tuesday. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperon her into the Abbey. The Duke, who just weeks ago reportedly paid £million out of court to settle a civil sexual assault case with a woman he said he had never met, has since been accused privately within the family of “manipulating” his position, sources have revealed.  Senior royals believe he still holds ambitions of staging an unlikelyto front line royal duties, despite being banished by the Queen over allegations he in  sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre, when she was a -year-old former sex slave of his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always strenuously denied the allegations.Prince Charles and Prince William were left “shocked” and dismayed” as Andrew emerged front and centre at Prince Philip ’s memorial service, attended by  guests and streamed live by the BBC.Due to her recent ill health and increasing frailty, The Queen’s attendance was not confirmed until less than two and a half hours before the .am ceremony. It was Her Majesty’s first major official engagement outside one of her homes for nearly six months. She last appeared to open the Welsh Senedd in Cardf on October .  Andrew was in the memorial order of service to arrive with other members of the family and his daughters at the West Door. But he travelled in a Range Rover with the Queen from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace, before changing cars into the State Bentley to the Abbey. There he walked arm in arm with the monarch, supported by a walking stick, before the Duke helped his mother to her seat and sat himself in the front row on the opposite side. One well placed insider said: “Both the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge reluctantly accepted that hewould travel with the Queen to the Abbey as they both live in Windsor.  “It was arguably palatablesimply down to logistics, but it goes without saying that most of the family were absolutely dismayed to see him walking the Queen up the aisle in full view of the entire congregation and broadcast cameras.” Charles,  and William, , have previously held private talks on how they deal with Andrew moving forward, both seemingly aware of his wish not to retire. Sources close to Andrew have suggested he “still believes he has much to offer the family and public service in general”, opening up the possibility he is aiming for a role for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer. Senior royal sources say that while Charles and William do not want him at official engagements, one insider added: “Ultimately as this episode shows, it’s up to the Queen - andshe wants Andrew there he will be there.”The possibility means there is scope for Andrew to attend the Jubilee service of thanksgiving in St Paul’s Cathedral on June , which will be considered a family occasion. Joe Little, of Majesty magazine, suggested: “I think he will be there. “Although the Queen is head of state, she is also head of the family as well and in that capacity all her children should be with her.” Clarence House today declined to comment on whether the Prince of Wales was supportive of the decision for Andrew to walk alongside the Queen, and Kensington Palace has yet to comment on where the Duke of Cambridge stands on the issue. Andrew has spent a considerable amount of time with the ailing -year-old monarch, who has suffered from a series of health problems in recent months as well as recovering from Covid. The Duke of York, who lives on the Windsor estate, has also been ever present at his mother’s Windsor Castle home after the death of her beloved husband Prince Philip, who died last April aged . Another source said: “There is definitely a hand being played. “Hewas straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate. “Now this situation has unfolded, a fair few hold the view that heis manipulating his position for his own gains.  “The Duke of York’s reputation precedes him and he’s made no secret that he’s not ready to fade away into the background, as much as everyone may want him to.” A source close to Prince Andrew said: “In his mind the situation with the allegations and the court case is firmly closed. “There is no case to answer, he settled for the good of the family and that’s that. “He’s very much of the view that he is a young man and has plenty to offer. “He’s not going to just sit at home and do nothing until the end of his days.”  Andrew had been banished from royal le, first bowing out of royal duties in  after his disastrous Newsnight appearance over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This January, he was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages by the Queen, and forced to relinquish using his HRH style amid his legal battle. Virginia Giuffre, now , was suing him for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was  after being trafficked by Epstein. At the time, Buckingham Palace said: “The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” Andrew remains in the line of succession, and is also still a Counsellor of State. In the event the Queen cannot undertake her official duties as sovereign on a temporary basis due to illness or absence abroad, two or more Counsellors of State are appointed by Letters Patent to act in her place. Buckingham Palace did not comment. A spokesperson for the Duke of York was unavailable for comment.

At the time, Claire’s parents, Alan and Jenner, were told a viral infection had spread from her stomach to her brain and that despite their efforts, medics were unable to save her. However, an inquest found that her death was actually the result of negligent care from an overdose of fluids and medication. Then, in the aftermath, Dr Steen allegedly tried to cover up her actions by incorrectly completing a medical certicate and on two later occasions.A television documentary, UTV’s When Hospitals Kill which was broadcast in October , raised questions about the treatment of a number of children who had died under similar circumstances. They died from hyponatraemia, which occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream, the same way Claire died. The same documentary also led to Claire’s dad to seek answers about his daughter’s care. Tom Forster QC, opening the case for the General Medical Council , said a public inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths, including that of Claire, was subsequently announced. In , Dr Steen failed to pass on the death for coronial investigation. Mr Forster said: The GMCaposs case is that ious procedural steps were taken by her in response to Claireaposs unexpected and problematic death in which she set out to conceal what she knew about Claireaposs death and the clear possibility there were failings in her care. In other words, a cover-up was attempted by Dr Steen to avoid scrutiny. He said that she withheld information not just in the immediate aftermath of the youngster’s tragic death. On March , Mr Forster said Dr Steen faces a very serious allegation of dishonesty. The tribunal has been asked to consider allegations, including that Dr Steen knowingly and dishonestly carried out several actions to conceal the true circumstances of Claireaposs death, according to Mr Forster. The public interest can only be servedthis tribunal... determines those allegations, he added.  But also later at a hospital meeting in  with Claire’s parents and again when she allegedly gave inaccurate evidence at an inquest into the youngster’s death in May . The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Servicehearing, sitting remotely, heard Claire was sent home from school on October   with a note from her teaching explaining she felt pale and lethargic. Claire went on to be sick two or three times at home before the family GP was called out and later referred her to hospital. The first doctor at hospital to see her noted her speech was very slurred and she was hardly talking. Mr and Mrs Roberts stayed with their daughter until she fell asleep at about pm and said they left with the impression she had a stomach bug, the tribunal heard. Nursing staff went on to note that her sodium levels were outside the expected range as Claire vomited on several occasions throughout the night. Her parents saw her again the next day and did not think she looked herself.  From there, her condition continued to go downhill and she suffered a five-minute seizure at :pm. This was followed by a number of other “episodes” into the evening. The hearing was told that a repeat blood test was not ordered earlier and consequently her fluid regime was not being assessed. Mr Forster said: At some point between :pm and :pm, Mr and Mrs Roberts decided to go home. They did so because concerns about Claireaposs condition was not communicated to them. They were wholly unaware that their daughter was seriously ill. Claire stopped breathing in the early hours of the next day and was ended up in intensive care at :am. At am, Dr Steen, the on-call consultant paediatrician, saw Claire for the first time. Mr Forster said: By am Claire was in reality already dead. Plainly this was devastating news to her parents. It must have also come as a great shock to her nurses and doctors.When Dr Steen came into the ICU she must have been asking how this possibly could have happened, whether there were matters to be investigated and whether or not Claireaposs death raised questions about the care she received. He said all she knew at that stage was Claire had suffered acute hyponatraemia which had been a contributory factor to the swelling of her brain. However, he said, later the same day she inappropriately completed a medical certicate of cause of death without reference to a confirmed diagnosis of the condition. Mr Forster said Dr Steen had admitted in her evidence to the hyponatraemia public inquiry that she failed in her care and ought to have done things dferently. She argued though that recognition came with the benefit of hindsight and she did not actively try and cover up her actions. The hearing continues. The hyponatraemia public inquiry concluded in  that Claireaposs death was the result of negligent care from an overdose of fluids and medication. A fresh inquest in  ruled her death was caused by the treatment she received in hospital.

She said that the weight loss has transformed her le and made her kinder and feel more beautulPearl Crump lost stn in one year thanks to weight loss surgery Image: mediadrumworld   @pearl.vs.pBySamantha Mordi:,  Mar |commentsA woman who used to hide junk food in her bedroom says she now constantly gets hit on by men after losing an incredible st. At her heaviest, Pearl Crump says size  clothes felt like they had been spray painted on and she would hide junk food in her bedroom so that she wouldnapost have to share it. But after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery in a bid to lose the weight she shed an incredible eight stone in a year . The -year-old, who at her heaviest weighed st lbs, said the weight loss has transformed her le, after having the surgery in . The public sector worker said: Throughout my le, Iaposve always loved food and hated exercise. I would always buy so much junk food from the supermarkets and hide it in my bedroom so I didnapost have to share it. Before I lost weight, I could easily eat a full Dominoaposs Pizza without even being full. All I would think about is food unless I was eating it but when I was done eating it, I was always thinking about what I would be eating next.Pearlaposs overeating of junk food - including chocolate and crisps - inevitably led to weight gain and she hated the way she looked as a teenager and young adult. She even avoided going out with friends and family as she felt like she was too big to be able to relax and be herself. At her heaviest, Pearl weighed st lbs and struggled to fit into UK size  clothes which were so tight that they felt like they had been spray painted on. When Pearl first floated the idea of weight loss surgery to those close to her, she was met by people telling her to aposgo to the gym insteadapos and that aposweight loss surgery was cheating.apos However, after Pearl discovered that she was unable to walk up more than three steps without feeling completely out of breath, she knew she had to make a drastic change in order to improve her health and feel better about herself. In August , Pearl decided to fly to Turkey to undergo gastric sleeve surgery in which over  per cent of the stomach is removed in order to reduce the capacity for eating. By the summer of , Pearl managed to lose a remarkable st lbs and now weighs just st lbs. She fits comfortably into size eight clothing.For Pearl, her weight loss has transformed her le in a iety of ways. Previously self-conscious in front of both friends and strangers, Pearl feels confident and beautul in her own skin. When on the street, Pearl notices that people treat her dferently to when she was larger and says that she has never been hit on as many times as she has been since her weight loss. Pearl is constantly told by friends that she looks amazing and has even been told that she should try modelling. She believes her weight loss has given her more energy and has made her a kinder person as a result. However, she admits that knowing when to stop eating food is still a challenge, but she is careful to avoid the snacks that led to her weight gain in the first place. She adds: When I was a kid, I was tiny but going into my teens, thataposs when I started to gain the pounds and I was always big as an adult.I absolutely hated the way I looked. For years I worked on cruise ships as an entertainer which I absolutely loved but when I was home from the ships, I hated leaving the house. I avoided friends and family as I felt so big and unattractive. I would always worry that people who I knew would see me when I left the house, so I stayed inside as much as I possibly could and would make excuses as to why I couldnapost meet up with friends when they asked.Before surgery, I felt like I had little to no support whatsoever. I would get comments like aposyou donapost need to have surgeryapos or aposwhy donapost you go to the gym and lose weight normallyapos or aposhaving surgery is cheating.apos She continued: I just ignored these comments because the only person that knew what was best for me, was me. The fact that I couldnapost walk up three steps without feeling like I was having an asthma attack, and I donapost even have asthma, was a big moment of realisation that things needed to change. I was wearing size twenty clothes and they were so tight on me that I felt as though someone had spray-painted my clothes on.So I flew to Turkey for weight loss surgery. Pearl says she now feels, amazing, confident and beautul.I feel so much more attractive and have never been hit on so many times in my entire le as I have been since I lost weight.More people are definitely attracted to me now than they were before.When people see me for the first time, they always say you look amazing which is great to hear. People say aposyouaposre tiny,apos and aposyouaposre smaller than me now.apos Iaposm so happy with how far Iaposve come on my journey. I feel like itaposs made me a better person. I have so much more energy, Iaposm kinder, and Iaposm also more confident. Before her weight loss, Pearlaposs typical diet consisted of a family share bag of crisps and chocolate for breakfast, followed by multiple sandwiches for lunch. For dinner, Pearl would often order a takeaway, totalling over , calories per day. Since losing weight, Pearl now has a protein bar for breakfast, a salad for lunch and a protein-based meal of either chicken, prawns or beef for dinner totalling , calories. Pearl is now happier than she has ever been in her le and only wishes she had looked into weight loss surgery sooner. I will say thatsomeone wanted to go down the weight loss surgery route, they should do it, said Pearl. Itaposs the best thing Iaposve ever done in my whole entire le. Iaposm so grateful for the second chance. I just wish that I had done it sooner.

The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"man who sent neighbour toothbrush","story":"Man who sent neighbour toothbrush to mock bad breath in fued admits harassmentSteven Wright, from Cheshire, posted the items through Colin Jones door after a feud which started in  - he has now been fined £ after admitting harassment after a court heard of a number of incidentsSteven Wright tormented his former neigbour Colin Jones since  Image: Cavendish PressLtdByJon HarrisSamantha Mordi:,  Mar |commentsA boorish prankster who sent his next-door neighbour a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste to mock his bad breath has been ordered to pay him £ compensation for harassment. Steven Wright posted the items through Colin Jonesapos door after a bitter feud which started in  when he moved next door and he has now been fined £ for harassment. After an argument over parking, the -year-old clenched his first under Mr Jonesapos chin and told him he could smell his bad breath. Landscape gardener Wright from Handforth, near Wilmslow, Cheshire also moved Mr Jonesaposs wheelie bin before it could emptied by refuse collectors, piled leaves and rocks in front of his car and switched on his washing machine late at night to make noise, the court heard. It was also alleged Wright vandalised two cars belonging to relatives of Mr Jones and covered CCTV cameras with plastic to prevent himself being filmed. It was claimed he also left an abusive note on the windscreen of Mr Jonesapos car.Mr Jones has since moved out and he reported Wright to police saying: These issues caused me a aposgreat deal of anxiety and I suffered a great deal of stress. My quality of le changed massively as a result of his behaviour and I had to move. I suffered financial loss in relation to installing CCTV as well as moving address. At Crewe magistrates court, Wright admitted harassment and was also fined £, and told to pay £ in costs and surcharges. He was also banned from contacting Mr Jones for  months under the terms of a restraining order. The incidents occurred between October  and April . At a previous hearing prosecutor Nicole Bridgman said: The complainant said he had been parking his car in a particular place for two years but the defendant was said to have told him: aposDo not f..king park here again, you cannot park here.apos On another occasion when the complainant asked the defendant to move debris from the drive, he pushed a pile of leaves and rocks in front of his car. When family members were staying at the complainantaposs property, both of their cars were damaged. The complainant suspects the defendant was responsible for that but there is nothing to prove it. In one incident the defendant put his clenched fist underneath the complainants chin and said he could smell his breath and words were exchanged. The next day, in a spiteful act of retaliation, the defendant posted through the letterbox a toothbrush and toothpaste to mock the complainant further.  The complainant later installed CCTV in April  which the defendant then covered up with plastic. The complainant said it cost £ to fix. There was damage to the complainantaposs fence, the police were called and officers asked both parties to stay away from each other. The defendant called the complainant a f..king w..ker. There is CCTV footage to show the defendant moving the bin before it was emptied. This caused the complainant harassment and distress. There is also an allegation that the defendant put his washing machine on in the early hours of the morning to make noise. In mitigation defence lawyer Sam Fixster told JPs: It is an assumption his car was damaged by this defendant. He does not know who it was and in all due respect. It is not the best of housing estates and things happen. He moved the wheelie bins onto a separate area of grassland. it started with an argument over a parking space. Itaposs probably something that happens a lot in blocks of flats - people park somewhere and notes get left on windscreens. It happens. The note was strongly worded and he apologised the next day but there was then an argument over the note and then further things, including leaving the toothpaste on Mr Jonesapos doorstep. It was a long time ago and there have been no issues with anybody . He is a landscaper by trade so he assists his neighbours with maintaining the area. So it seems to have been a clash of personalities.

However the Sussexes decided not to attend and also opted against releasing a statement or a tribute to Harryaposs grandfather to mark the day. The announcement came amid a row over his security in the UK, with Harry saying it wasnapost safe for him to bring his family here. Royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed, tells The Mirror she believes their silence speaks volumes.She said: The wall of silence was as loud asthey had shouted from the abbey rafters. The normally verbose duke and duchess of Sussex said nothing. No spokesperson spewed out long sentences of undecipherable wordage. There were no flowers with the florists name proudly displayed. No comments from Archwell. Nothing. Not even a word from their supporters on ious social media accounts. Harry used his Archwell website to share a moving tribute to his grandfather after his death last year, describing him as master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end.Sheaposs also criticised Harry and Meghanaposs decision not to attend and says fears that their appearance would overshadow the event were not accurate.There has been a great deal of criticism about Prince Harry ’s absence from his grandfather’s memorial service. But no reason given as to why he chose not to attend from Harry himself.A couple of weeks ago he instructed his spokesperson to say he wouldn’t be going. That was it.  What a missed opportunity it was not to bring Meghan and the children to join the extended royal family, European cousins and of course Archie’s contemporaries. Their appearance would not have erted attention away from the Queen. It was her day and no one could take that away from her not even her favourite son the Duke of York who guided her to her seat. The only explanation is that neither one of them wanted to go. There would have been no security problems. The whole Abbey was bristling with secret service men to guard the biggest gathering of royalty, politicians and top army brass since the London wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Harry must have known it would look petulant and rude. Andhe did not Meghan would have. If it was a pointed snub to the whole royal family and it went sour. Of course, the Queen would have been told well in advance. Harry keeps in constant touch with his grandmother for many reasons. I am sure he spoke to his father too. But nothing excuses his absence evenMeghan and the children stayed away. He will not get another opportunity to pay his respects in public to the grandfather who always supported him. He has upset too many influential people too many times. It is something he will live to regret.

Can Arslan is currently on trial for the murder of Matthew Boorman, who was stabbed  times on his front lawn after ing home from work. The -year-old Arslan was charged with four offences and pleaded guilty to three of them including attempted murder, GBH with intent and affray. Bristol Crown Court heard Arslan was fuelled by anger and revenge against fellow residents in his village who had been trying to evict him for several years due to his anti-social behaviour. The jury heard the massacre took place on October , , after neighbours spent months trying to evict him. Repeated warnings were allegedly made to cops and to his victims - including telling one officer of his murderous intentions the day before Arslan carried out the attack on October , , the jury heard. The entire incident in the village of Walton Cardf near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was caught on CCTV and doorbell cameras. Some of the CCTV footage has now been released by police after being shown to the jury.  The released footage focuses on the aftermath of Arslan fatally wounding Mr Boorman, , and his we Sarah Boorman by stabbing her in the leg as she tried to save her husband. Video footage then shows him going around the corner to another neighbour, Peter Marsden, who had also been involved in the legal proceedings to get him out of his home - and attacking him too. The CCTV shows him walking into his kitchen and then Arslan being forcibly removed. But not before he had stabbed Mr Marsden a total of eight times.  The court heard Arslan also had another neighbour, in the small village of Walton Cardf, near Tewkesbury, Glos., in his sights. But he was stopped by a group of brave have-a-go heroes who gathered in the street to corner him until the police arrived. One of the men was an off-duty police officer, Steve Wilkinson, who is seen on camera armed with a piece of wood and hitting Arslan with it to try and stop the attack. The trial heard Arslan had targeted neighbours who had complained about his anti-social behaviour and were having him evicted in a long-running dispute about a shared driveway. On Monday, the court heard he would shout at them Iaposll put you down while he was also recorded six months before the killings stating that I am going to f*****g do a massacre, according to prosecutor Kate Bronner QC. Ms Bronner added: This is what he set out to do six months later before he was stopped in his tracks.  In a recorded police interview, Mrs Boorman said she unlocked the front door for her husband at around pm on the day of his murder. She reported seeing Arslan cross in front of their kitchen window. At first, she thought he was throwing punches, but quickly realised he was wielding a kne. She mimed the action of the blade being brought down and over again into her husbandaposs face and neck, saying: “He continued to just stab Matthew like he was an animal. She went on to describe how she had screamed at the neighbours to come and help. Arslan then swiped at her with the kne.  I wish I had hitwith something or thrown something or done something to distract him so Matthew had a chance to run, she said. Arslan treated Matthew like he was a piece of meat he sat on top of him and he lit a cigarette ashe was triumphant. Then he threw the cigarette on the floor and got up casually and walked around to the front garden as Matthew lay dying on the floor. Describing the defendant’s manner, she said: He was calm, he knew exactly what he was doing, he had waited for Matthew, he had done what he had done to Matthew and he was pleased with what he had done to Matthew.  She said her oldest boy even saw his fatheraposs bloodied body from the window. She said: “He can’t get it out of his head.” Arslan was eventually tasered by police and arrested. Arslan has admitted attempted murder, GBH with intent and affray, but denies the murder of Mr Boorman on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Opening the case for the prosecution at Bristol Crown Court, Kate Brunner QC, said Arslan did not dispute he had carried out the attacks, but is denying murder and claiming it was manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. He earlier admitted attempted murder and causing GBH with intent in relation to the attacks on both Sarah Boorman and Mr Marsden. Ms Brunner said: On that Autumn afternoon there were three victims. This defendant killed one neighbour, he also tried to stab another neighbour to death and stabbed a third person in a leg. All of that he accepts. There was a long running neighbour dispute between this defendant and the victims of his attack. The neighbours had repeatedly lodged complaints with the police and council about his behaviour. The prosecution case is he targeted the neighbours that had been trying to have him evicted and took his revenge against them in the most extreme of ways. Ms Brunner said Arslan was charged with four offences and pleaded guilty to three of them including attempted murder, GBH with intent and affray. He is standing trial on just the one offence of murder.

She was given fertility drugs, but it took her a further  months to fall pregnant. Alana, , of Essex, is now expecting her first child with fiancée Jack Costin, . She said: I started taking the pill because I was bleeding for three weeks every cycle and was getting anaemic. It suppressed my periods and seemed like a good solution at the time. I had no idea it would take so long for them to come back once I stopped taking the pill, or that it would be another two years before I managed to have a healthy pregnancy.I do want people to remember stories like mine are very uncommon, and things like this typically donapost happen. A lot of the time, birth control isnapost the root cause of the problem, but it can make pre-existing problems that you are unaware of so much worse and harder to manage.  Alana now urges people to do research in case they could be negatively affected. She said: Make sure you do a lot of your own research - donapost just go with the first thing suggested to you. Go with the option that feels right for you, and remember you can always change your mind once youaposve started. Alana, who works in marketing, started taking the pill when she was  following a year of abnormal periods.She came off it five years later in  because she thought it was impacted her mental health. When Alana was  she knew she wasnapost ready to have a child, but knew she wanted to be a mum one day. She grew concerned when her periods had not come back. In January , she saw a doctor after not having her period for two years. Alana was diagnosed with Pill-Induced PCOS and was given metformin, inositol supplementsand a week course of norethisterone to induce a period. In October , she fell pregnant but sadly miscarried.After further treatment, Alana fell pregnant on New Yearaposs Eve in . Now, she is four months pregnant and scans show her unborn baby is in good health. Alana added: I feel immensely blessed and grateful to be pregnant because at times it never felt like we would get to this point. However, Iaposve mostly been anxious. Going through infertility and pregnancy loss meant that when I did fall pregnant, I assumed things would eventually go wrong. In early pregnancy, I would take a test pretty much every single day and compare the line to the day before to check it was getting darker.

This pregnancy has gone perfectly and I havenapost had a single complication or any reason to worry, but the anxiety never goes away. But I am excited to welcome this child.

The -year-old, who lives in Quorn, Leicestershire, with his we and dog, had already been working on songwriting in his own time.Paul realised Kev was destined to sing and it was not long before he had signed a deal and released his debut album, Leicestershire Live reports. The s-influenced Why Can’t I Be You  was written and produced by the man himself. And after Kevaposs story was shared online across the world, he was contacted by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Stacy Sherman and American screenwriter and producer Billy Ray. Kev has now signed another contract - for his story to be told on the big screen. Ray wrote the screenplay for the  blockbuster The Hunger Games, and now has the rights to Kevaposs story.Describing how surreal his journey has been, Kev said it was like watching it happen to someone . Not for one minute did I think this could happen to me, he said. I’ve had some sleepless nights thinking about this whole story – the record deal and now the film. It’s so exciting. Paul, who first saw Kevaposs star potential while his bathroom was being fitted, added: We know the story won’t follow our le stories exactly but will be based on it, and we can’t wait to see exactly what they do with it. Paul is himself an internationally acclaimed haiku poet. A script has been written by legendary British sitcom and film writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who wrote hit comedies including The Likely Lads, Porridge and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet - shows Kev said he grew up watching. The project is now at screenplay stage, with input from screenwriter Billy Ray, who wrote the  sixth instalment of the Terminator series, Terminator: Dark Fate, and the Academy-Award nominated screenplay for the  film Captain Phillips. It feels unreal to be now working with the creators of those and having Zoom calls with them in LA and to think it’s our story that they’re working on, Kev said. When asked who might play the bathroom fitter and record company owner, Paul said: I think actors like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost might work, not because they look like us but because like Kev and I, they work well together and they’re English. Other names suggested by ious people we are working with include Jude Law, Colin Firth, Jason Statham and Ricky Gervais, Kev laughed. Producer Stacy Sherman said: This is a story about the human spirit and music. What could be better  Sinks fixed, dreams dashed, heartache, hope and UK music. I mean... While there is no release date set for the film just yet, Paul and Kev are learning about the work that goes into a Hollywood production. Meanwhile, Kev is still fitting bathrooms around the East Midlands, has a new record out on April , and is currently working with LA producer Jesse Irwin and Paul on his next album.

He has let the Queen down once again, says Polly HudsonThe Duke of York, right, with his late father Prince Philip and mother Queen Elizabeth Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Mar |comments It doesn’t feel that controversial an opinion to say that I never want to see Prince Andrew again.Hard not to assume that most people feel the same way. So it seems impossible that Andrew, and those around him, aren’t aware of that. They must know exactly how popular he is, and that there is nothing that will ever change that.Of course Andrew is entitled to go to a memorial service for his father – but it is utterly tone deaf of him not to have read the room. He clearly should have slipped into the building quietly, sat somewhere discreet, tried to be as invisible as possible. To instead arrogantly rock up front and centre stage, even travelling in a car with the star of the show, is appalling behaviour, even by his standards.If his mother needed assistance on the journey, and down the aisle, there are plenty of other family members who could – who should – have been by her side instead.Andrew has let the poor Queen down, yet again, on what was already a testing day for many reasons. He shouldn’t have put her in that position, he should have insisted on travelling alone, being seated separately, definitely not in the front row, of all places.Sitting smugly in the hot seat makes it seem like he doesn’t understand the seriousness of what has happened, the cloud over him that will never go away – or that he simply doesn’t care. In reality it’s hardly a shock that Andrew hasn’t done the right thing –he was man of honour and integrity he would have nothing to apologise for. Which, let’s never forget, he never has. Palace insiders believe that after today he will effectively disappear from public le. Good riddance. Don’t let the palace door hit you on the way out.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince GeorgePrincess CharlottePrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyThe Queen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The ceremony, which saw , people pack into Westminster Abbey, remembered Her Majestyaposs husband of  years and his incredible legacy. The event was in stark contrast to his funeral, held just over a week after his death aged  last April.It came at a time when the UK was in the grip of a coronavirus lockdown with restrictions meaning the funeral had to be vastly scaled back. Only  guests attended and one of the most heartbreaking images from that day was seeing the Queen having to sit by herself in St Georgeaposs Chapel - away from any of her family members.  However, it seems that in her handbag that day, she carried around two rather personal items in order to give her comfort. One of those items was said to be a photo of the couple as newlyweds that she carried in her handbag. The photo is believed to have been one of her and Philip in Malta which had a special place in their hearts.

Click here to sign up .After they were married the couple lived in Villa Guardamangia, close to the capital Valletta. Philip was stationed on the Mediterranean island from  until  as a naval officer with HMS Magpie. The then-Princess Elizabeth was able to live a more normal le in Malta and it was one of the happiest times for her and Philip before she became Queen.Meanwhile, according to the Daily Mail, another item she took was a white handkerchief made by Savile Row tailors Kent  Haste that were a Philip trademark. He would have them folded into squares in a classic style and put into his breast pocket.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the Queen made a sweet tribute to her husband at his memorial service. She had been actively involved in the planning of the fitting memorial service and she ensured there were plenty of personal touches at the event. And among the sweet tributes that were made to Philip at the event was one dated back to the day Her Majesty married Philip in November  - in the same Abbey. Thataposs because the flowers in the church for the memorial service were in shades of patriotic red, white and blue, with larger arrangements featuring blue eryngium – known as sea holly – a nod to the duke’s career in the Royal Navy, and his lelong affection for the sea. Meanwhile, the smaller posies included white dendrobium orchids - the flowers that appeared in Princess Elizabeth’s wedding bouquet when she married Philip in . The Queen is said to have personally requested orchids to be included in her wedding bouquet.

Prince William, fresh from crisis talks with aides following backlash from his Caribbean tour, perhaps wonderedthere was any point in working so hard to modernise the monarchy when his efforts were so easily undone. Andrew had every right to attend his father’s memorial, of course. But was it right that he should be at the forefront of the poignant and public proceedings  Other members of the royal family, according to sources, believe not.  No matter how forcefully they tried to dissuade the Queen from plucking her disgraced son from the shadows - and let’s not forget Princess Anne’s famously direct nature - favouritism for her second son seems to have reigned over their disapproval and disdain. Few understand why Andrew is notoriously her favourite child yet fewer question it truly is the case. In the acclaimed Netflix series The Crown, Philip admitted Anne was his favoured child so the Queen invited each to lunch as a series of tests to discover hers. Although she realised all four had dislikable traits, at least Andrew had a sense of humour as he made fart jokes and guffawed at his playboy ways. And while it might be fiction, there’s little doubt there’s at least an element of truth to Andrew having the Queen’s favour.  Royal commentators believe the -year gap between Anne and Andrew is remembered as a particularly happy time for Her Majesty, when she rediscovered happiness in her marriage and stepped back from royal duties to spend more time with her young son. Certainly she seems quick to forgive his catastrophes and connection with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Even after Virginia Giuffre’s shocking accusations of rape and his disastrous Newsnight interview which forced him to step back from total duties, Andrew, , is said to have been the Queen’s rock during Prince Harry and Meghan’s exit from the royal stage. Reports that Andrew ripped up the carefully choreographed plan to step aside at the abbey’s entrance to ensure his mother walked down the aisle with the Dean of Westminster suggest he has not tempered his trademark arrogance. Instead, he clung to her arm of the woman who bailed him out of debt much to the chagrin of his siblings. In the car beside the Queen, Andrew had the audacity to wave at his family. He may as well have thumbed his nose.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

Kyra Leanne King lost her le in the car park area of Ostler’s Plantation, a wooded area near Woodhall Spa, Lincs, at .pm on  March.Two people were arrested following the death, but they have been released under investigation, Lincolnshire Live reported. Assistant Coroner for Lincolnshire Paul Cooper today opened the inquest into Kyraaposs death during a short hearing at the Myle Cross Centre in Lincoln. Lincolnshire Police Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Cox previously said: “This is an exceptionally sad incident, and one that we know will impact the local community, or indeed anyone hearing about it. “There may be a temptation to speculate about what happened while people attempt to understand this tragedy, and we’d ask people to avoid doing so, particularly on social media where facts can become distorted.  We will do everything we can to establish what has happened, and we’d like to thank everyone for their support.” The inquest heard evidence from Coroneraposs Officer Jackie Foxlow who confirmed that East Midlands Ambulance Service were called to Ostleraposs Plantation. A preliminary postmortem carried out by Forensic Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton at Leicester Royal Infirmary recorded the provisional cause of death as head and neck injuries. The inquest opening also heard evidence from temporary Detective Inspector Cally Murray, who told the hearing it remained a live investigation and enquiries into the circumstances are continuing while two people remain under investigation. The officer said the child died after sustaining injuries from a dog attack, but added that investigators were keeping an open mind about the incident generally. Lincolnshire Police will be seeking a destruction order against the dog, which has been seized and remains in kennels, once active proceedings are completed, the inquest heard. Assistant Coroner Cooper adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed and said it could take some months for enquiries to be completed.  Assistant Coroner Cooper said: This is a sad case. There is a grieving family out there. Any social media comments could be hurtful. The breed of dog involved in the incident, which happened in the car park area of Ostler’s Plantation, was not disclosed during the hearing, but Lincolnshire Police have previously said they believed it to be a Husky. Officers launched an investigation into the death and previously arrested a -year-old woman and a -year-old man on suspicion of being in charge of a dog which was out of control. They were later released under investigation.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Lincolnshire PoliceDangerous dogsInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mischievous little pup will often obstruct walkways, but nobody ever gets annoyed with him - heaposs far too adorable for that.Bosco has a loyal following online with over . million fans on TikTok, and has even started his own dog stick trend. Owner Luccia Rodriguez, , based in London, told The Mirror : Carrying big sticks is Boscoaposs favourite thing to do. He loves making people happy and thrives off the attention.  to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. In the video of Bosco, you can see just how popular he is with local dog walkers in the park, who all make way for his royal canine highness. He proudly walks with his ginormous stick, taking up the entire pathway and dodging peopleaposs feet. Strangers will clap for Bosco and most people get their cameras out to film, Luccia said. Elderly people seem to be such big fans. Luccia says Boscoaposs stick obsession started when he was six months old, and heaposs loved them ever since. It was soon after a storm and we were walking on a heath. He spotted big branches that had been blown over and tried to pick one up, she explained.  We thought it was cute and he loved the attention from other people in the park so started to do it more.About three years ago, Luccia began posting videos of Bosco on Instagram for family and friends to see - then one year ago created a TikTok account and it took off.His fans are most shocked by the tiny size of Bosco and the huge sticks he succeeds in carrying. He manages to find that perfect spot and will try again and again until he does. He doesnapost like the stick dragging, Luccia said.When he gets tired, heaposll drop it and carry on with the walk. As much as Bosco would love to take each and every giant stick home, Luccia just doesnapost have the space for it. Itaposs not just sticks Bosco has a habit of picking up - heaposs carried water bottles, dummies, brooms, walking canes and even scooters. Heaposs a bit like a raccoon - he loves picking up general rubbish, she said. Luccia will often replace Boscoaposs sticks with props for big holidays - on Valentineaposs Day it was an arrow, and at Christmas it was a tree. She says Bosco definitely thinks heaposs a big dog and has little man syndrome.  Though itaposs no surprise heaposs got confidence, when celebrities like Will Smith have shared their love for him online. Bosco met Ricky Gervais in the park once and barked at him, and Will Smith reposted one of his videos, Luccia said. Luccia describes Bosco as adventurous, loving and independent, and says he has a very strong personality. He puts everyone in such a good mood and it makes me happy when people are so nice, she added.Do you have a dog story to tell  Contact nia.dalton@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Substitute teacher Jay Bowman had been asked by some pupils about the bracelet he wore and explained the importance behind it and offered them the one he had on. However, that led to his sacking from his school, Huntington Local High School, in Ross County, Ohio.His sacking led to a huge protest as hundreds of people, including parents, teachers and pupils voiced their support for him. Bowman said he was asked by some students about his ‘First Capital PRIDE’ rainbow-coloured ban, a local LGBTQ+ rights organisation. He told the Scioto Valley : When approached by students who expressed a certain point of view, I happily slid the band off my arm, offered it to the student, and explained that First Capital Pride offered support groups for teens who may be struggling, are suicidal, are ostracized, and need support.  However, he was dismissed soon after, and claimed it was because of this action as school policies prevent teachers from discussing “religious and political topics”. The school considered supporting LGBTQ+ rights amongst this and he said the school told him they had received community complaints, Mr Bowman spoke out to ABC about his sacking, he said: I know Iaposve opened a can of worms and I know Iaposve started a discussion, and I trust that the members of this community know that I did that with no ill intent.On Facebook he added that the greater lesson here isnapost about me ever being welcomed back, saying that instead it is about that student sitting alone in the classroom, feeling like they are somehow less.The now openly gay man, who has been teaching for over  years, added: If a kid has questions,a kid wants honesty, I donapost think I should be forbidden from providing that. However, the teacher’s sacking proved unpopular and he received overwhelming support from parents and students. Pupils even staged a protest outside the high school and some even reportedly wore pride bracelets in class to support of Mr Bowman.  The school board maintained that he “violated board policies by speaking to students about political and religious topics, as well as distributing bracelets”. In the past, Mr Bowman had remained “closeted” not telling anyone that he was gay to avoid the sack. He is now speaking up after his dismissal because he does not want any student to “feel less”. He said: Huntington is my home. It is where I got my first teaching job. It is everything to me. I love this community. I love this school. He said in a post dated  March: I am a good, student-first teacher. I love all Godaposs children and the kids at Huntington will always hold a place in my heart. “Huntington Schools is home to me. I lived there for more years than anywhere . I do not ever put students at risk. “I work hard at reaching out to every single student I meet. These great kids respond well to me and we have a genuine teacher student affection for one another.  He added: By the way Ohio state law still permits firing anyone just for being LGBTQIA+. Some donapost realised this fact. Then, he posted a second time three days later, adding: The purpose of my   post was not for the district to be punished in any way, shape or form but feel they should be open  honest about how lowly they regard the LGBTQIA+ and not hide behind a flimsy policy. I hold no ill will towards anyone affiliated with their decision to cancel me. He went on to say: The adminaposs reasoning for cancelling merings more than a bit hollow to me. “If the bandshad been supportive of any number of other ideas entities, I believe the outcome would have been far dferent. “Current post responses shares reveal a strong disparity between the policy used against me  the views of the broader community .Bowman also said: Remember, the greater lesson here isnapost about me ever being welcomed backor about showing hatred towards anyone. “It is about that student sitting alone in the classroom, feeling like they are somehow less. And showing them that they can change their world!!Members of the local community are planning to bring the matter up at a school board meeting scheduled for  April in a bid for them to reconsider the policies. The Scioto Valleyreports that the school is now at risk of losing its federal funding over the matter, saying: On his first day in office, President Biden issued an executive order declaring that prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of sex cover discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. [...] It is unknown how much of the local school districtaposs funding is federal, but it is believed millions of dollars are at risk.

Originally called the Hardie-Coleman house, it acquired its sinister new name after the -year-old was murdered in  and discovered buried under the grand porch. Allan lived there with his adoptive parents Philip and Margaret Lucy when he went missing and they claimed he had run away to Florida to live with his friends. It was only when the couple sold the home and the new owners began renovating it years later that the truth came out. A builder discovered the teenaposs remains wrapped in a Disney blanket in  while inspecting the foundations. The mansion, built in , was then abandoned. David, who runs Abandoned Alabama, has revisited the property to get a series of eerie pictures. He said: Ironically, Allan’s adoptive parents were arrested just a week prior to the remains being discovered on an arson charge in connection to the fire that damaged the house.Police believed they torched the house in order to claim on the , insurance policy which was purchased just a month prior. While the couple was in custody, authorities performed a thorough investigation of the property and questioned family members before charging Philip Lucy with murder. He added: Residents will never forget the events that unfolded there in .  Korean War veteran Philip was found guilty of murder in . He was then re-convicted on appeal in  and hung himself the same day in his jail cell. Margaret was implicated in Allanaposs death but was allowed to remain free to care for her other kids. She orced Philip but died of cancer in .  The coupleaposs biological son, Jason, told anyone who would listen that he had seen his father in the kitchen strike Allan in the head with his fist, knocking him to the ground. Jason claimed he was ordered to go to his room and later saw Philip walking around outside covered in dirt and holding a shovel. No one believed him for years until the truth was discovered.  One of Davidaposs snaps shows the crumbling front of the house, where the body was discovered. Another shows the living room with whitewashed patches on the yellow paint. Other photos show the extent of the overgrown greenery, and how many rooms are littered with construction supplies. The market value of the property plummeted after the murder. It is currently owned by Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.

They quickly struck up a conversation and chatted for hours at the bar after dinner. The pair exchanged numbers and several days later they met up for their first date - but there was something on her mind. While the age gap didnapost bother either of them, Nena was concerned that nephrologist Jose had had a vasectomy and got made him agree to have it reversed so they could one day start a family.  The woman from Florida, US, said: We didnapost feel love at first sight despite really liking each other. I was intrigued to see him again, but we thought our connection would be something very casual. During one of our dates, we got to talking about our futures where Jose mentioned that he didnapost want to get married and that as he had a vasectomy, he wouldnapost be able to have kids. After that, I didnapost really see the relationship going anywhere as marriage and kids are two of the most important things to me. We continued to see each other every few months after this, but despite our attraction to one another, the age dference definitely made us both quite sceptical of the relationship going anywhere serious.After taking a trip around Florida, I could tell that Jose was falling in love with me. I think he realised that I was a lot more apprehensive, but after three months, I couldnapost hide my feelings for him any longer. After four months of dating, the duo decided to move in together once their relationship had reached new levels. Although the two have had their doubts about their relationship, they are now planning in the near future to get engaged and hope to tie the knot shortly after. If the vasectomy reversal fails for any reason, we will likely pursue IVFneeded. We want to be able to have a family together, which most people think is crazy, she went on.  People donapost understand why Jose is having a baby so late and they donapost understand why I want to have a baby with someone who is far older than me - but we feel connected like soulmates and want to experience having a family together. Thereaposs a thirty-five year age gap between us, which was a struggle for Jose to get over at first as people kept staring at us each time we were out in public. I have dated older guys before, so I wasnapost too fussed - but even thirty-five years was a bit of a push for me at the beginning. However, we get along so well - heaposs the best friend Iaposve ever had. We do most things together and Jose treats me like a princess by surprising me with romantic gts such as flowers.  I also treat Jose like the king that he is by surprising him with things like an indoor picnic which I did for our anniversary, as well as other little gts. Critics accuse her of being a aposgold diggerapos and him of being a apossick old man,apos but Nena said they are soulmates. Iaposve shown him a new way of le, which has helped him to come out of his comfort zone - which erases any doubts that we had, she said. We told Joseaposs family and friends in May  who were really supportive. Due to this, I went on to tell my family and friends. Despite my friends being happy for us, my family werenapost very accepting besides my sister - which Iaposm not too fussed about, as Iaposm not that close to my family. I moved in with Jose after around four months of being together, which has been so fun and neither one of us have ever been so excited to come home to someone in a very long time. For the future, weaposre planning on getting engaged and hopefully married soon after. Starting a family is very high up on our priority list and I thinkJose wasnapost open to getting a vasectomy reversal, we wouldnapost have made it as a couple.

Maria Sylvia said she first noticed the dark brown mark ten years ago - but thought nothing of it, as she was in and out of doctors all the time due to being an athlete.The Tik Toker - who has more than , followers - shared the news online after finding out it had probably been cancerous for the last three years. Doctors tol her it was subungual melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer that takes hold in the skin under your nails She said on her page @invrfoundwaldo : No one really noticed it until one time a doctor did notice it. This was probably circa , and they were like, aposoh, thataposs oddapos. But you donapost really fit the demographics. Maria, from the US, was offered surgery in which doctors removed her nail and part of the bone. She said: “Melanoma can sit in a stage called in situ, which is kind of like stage zero, for up to  years. “So itaposs very likely that this has just been sitting for  years and itaposs been maybe cancerous for the last three, itaposs kind of hard to tell.” When she woke up she had a cast covering her entire hand and stopped her thumb from moving as it recovered.Mariaaposs thumb was given a skin graft, with doctors taking flesh from her arm. Sheaposs now waiting to see what the final result will look like. He video, which has reached  million people, has left viewers worried about their own similar streaks.

Work was carried out during lockdown to restore the Grade I Georgian listed building, and someone looking at the wooden benches found something they thought looked unusual.

Williamaposs mother Sarah Ann Elliott was left a widow with four children and, although the family had been fairly comfortable until then, by  she was working as a dressmaker to keep the family afloat.

Not white with a bit of blush, but like, obviously pink, so I thought this was totally fine and not breaking any etiquette rules, she explained. It also had spaghetti straps and wasnapost too apospoofyaposyou know what I mean. So you can imagine her surprise when she sees the bride walking down the aisle in a blush wedding dress with spaghetti straps. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. She literally gives me daggers and what made the situation worse was that we both had our hair down in a similar styleand we both have the same shade of red hair. It was almost comical, she said. Since the wedding, she claims the entire family have been super cold with her, including her cousin who called her an a**hole for trying to upstage the bride and that she should have avoided blush as itaposs an obvious bridal colour. The family seem to think I did this deliberately because Iaposd been upset that I hadnapost been invited to the bridal shower or bachelorette and had been feeling a bit excluded, she said. I was upset at the time, but this was not deliberate sabotage. I honestly felt like it was just an awkward accident but nah. She concludes her post by asking whether she should have known that blush was also a no-go colour for wedding guests, and Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts.One person said: If a bride is wearing anything but white and doesn’t want to be upstaged she needs to let people know. People aren’t mind readers. Another wrote: This! I had an invitation to a wedding party which explicitly said aposThe bride will be wearing a red dress, so please donapost wear a red suit or dress. Red accents and ties are fine!apos And I was like aposCool, I wonapost wear red.apos But this is...not done nearly that well. In an update, the woman revealed where things went wrong... She said sheaposd told her husband about this post as an, aposI told you soapos that she was [not the a**hole]apos and how it was impossible for her to have known what the bride was wearing, however...Apparently heaposd been told it wasnapost white, but he didnapost tell me that as he thought it wasnapost info worth sharing. He has a habit of not passing on info that other people would expect him to, such as family members being ill, breakups etc. He told [mother-in-law] that he didnapost even remember about the dress being blush so couldnapost have told me, and they seem to think heaposs just lying to cover for me. This is all news to me becauseIaposd known I would have immediately understood why [sister-in-law] was so shocked upset.

And although a child-free wedding might be less than ideal for guests with kids, itaposs important to respect the wishes of the bride and groom - especiallytheyaposve also gone out of their way to provide childcare for you. But one woman on Reddit has vented her frustrations after her guests chose to completely ignore her request to keep kids away from her big day, even after she hired a total of five babysitters to help look after the little ones of any guests who couldnapost find their own childcare. The bride, from the US, also explained she doesnapost have a problem with children, but her venue charged full price for all children over the age of two, meaning an extra for every child who attended the wedding.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In her post, she said: The kids are generally good, so the main issue was the cost. We wrote this on the website and claried it with anyone who asked. We got a lot of grief over this, so we felt a fair comprise was to:. Extend the dinner the night before to include kids, and the restaurant was very nice about having close to  kids. . Hire  babysitters for - kids on the wedding night for locals who couldnapost find a babysitter last-minute, and for guests who travelled with their kids. My in-laws offered their home less than  minutes away to host all the kids. On the day of her wedding, three couples arrived with a total of nine children between them - and when the groomsmen offered to take the kids to the babysitting location, the parents made a scene.  The children stayed at the wedding, but the event soon descended into chaos - with some kids throwing food. The bride added: When the ceremony started, one kid started wailing and another skipped down the aisle in front of me. I played it cool, and the staff was on top of it. They escorted the mum and the  kids outside. The rest of the ceremony went smoothly. During the reception, the same  kids were screaming and throwing food. Other guests and staff were trying to get them to sit. At one point, one kid went under my dress, which was so f***ing weird. I didnapost notice and almost tripped. My bridesmaids pointed out that the food they threw got on my dress and thataposs when I had enough. I gave my husband aposthe lookapos and he rounded up the kids, brought them to the parents, and asked them to leave for good. After the event, the bride and her husband decided to send a bill to the three couples who brought their children to get them to pay the extra  per head. And while two couples were immediately apologetic and paid without question, the couple with the particularly rowdy brood refused to pay up - because they were asked to leave before the cake was cut. She said: After the event, we sent a bill to the three couples with a letter saying we had a lovely time with them and reminding them that they agreed to pay for the uninvited kids. Two couples paid and were apologetic, and even said they understood why we couldnapost include the kids. Of course, the couple with the  rowdy kids refused to pay because we asked them to leave before cake ... seriously. Instead of apologising, we got a nasty call. All I said was they should be lucky I didnapost send the dry cleaning bill for the dress.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MarriageWeddingsWedding day\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Eoin OaposFaodhagain is a veteran spotter and regularly records sightings via the lochaposs webcam, but he was worried as no one had seen the monster for a while, as the Daily Record reports.He kept his eyes peeled and monitored the webcam day and night, as well as the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register where no official sightings had been recorded for three months.But Eoin, who had his first sighting back in , was watching the webcam live stream last Wednesday afternoon , when he spotted something unexplained. What do you think about the Loch Ness Monster  Let us know in the comments...He explained that it appears to be two objects moving parallel to each other across the middle of the screen. The -year-old shared the video capture of the virtual sightings, which show strange dark shapes moving about on the surface of the loch. When one person commented that the clip could just be of a log or some debris, Eoin responded: The more northerly object takes a sharp turn to the left leaving an unusual wake, you would have to rule out a log or debris, and it is not consistent of a seal to react in such a manner.

Inverness-based Register keeper Gary ­Campbell, who has recorded more than , alleged sightings of mystical Nessie over the past  years, recently stated that the start of the year and the end of winter is usually quiet time for the monster. He added that didnapost mean they havenapost had any reports in , far from it, but much like the majority of claimed sightingsthey are explainable they donapost make it into the register. It appears the latest video was deemed credible enough to be unexplainable and therefore has been added to the list.

He said: A close friend of mine for years is engaged to a guy who I really like and is getting married in May. Yesterday, a friend of mine found her on Bumble and texted me screenshots. I sent them to her askingthere is something I should know, and she replied that they must be from when she was still single and that she probably forgot to turn it off. Thing is, I recognise the pictures and theyaposre recent. My girlfriend and I are even in one of them. I had spoken to her fiancé earlier that day about bachelor party plans and everything sounded like it was very much still on. The man now wondershis friend is having second thoughts about the marriage, and is unsure of whether or not to approach her fiancé with the dating app evidence. He added: Some of our friends have joked that she can do better - sheaposs really, really attractive and makes great money, while heaposs very much the blue-collar type. But he treats her like a princess, a big upgrade from the boys sheaposs dated in the past. I get the feeling sheaposs having second thoughts and looking around again.

One person said: I know plenty of people might say stay out of it and I understand that to some degree, but all I can think is thatI were that guy I would hope someone would tell me that information before I got married to a person like her.

The disgruntled customer had paid for a ticket to comedy play As You Like It at the York Theatre Royal last week, performed by the Northern Broadsides theatre company. In advertising the play, the Halax-based company tells punters it will be performed as bold, accessible and unapologetic Northern voices. Jess Rooney, who works for the company, said the complaint had made everyone chuckle because it was so outrageous. She said: Iaposm not sure who the complaint applied to specically but pretty much all of the actors have a Northern accent. They donapost hide them. Our whole selling point and what we do dferently is Shakespeare in northern voices. We were just quite bemused by it at first. Weaposve been working on ing northern voices on stage for the last  years. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here In my time, Iaposve never seen this complaint. The play, which ran from  March to  March, is advertised as being performed by apos Northern actorsapos and has been praised by critics. But when one unhappy audience member complained about the proud Northern actors, the staff were left in stitches. Jess said: Itaposs a normal thing to hear northern voices and Yorkshire accents on stage these days. We were one of the first to do this  years ago and since then I think a lot of people have taken it on board. Itaposs more of a thing people enjoy to hear. It makes the [characters] sound like them and people can relate to it a little bit more. A lot of Shakespearian language is hard to get used to anyway soyou hear it in your own voice, it makes the experience a lot more accessible. She added the complaint had actually done the company the world of good. In a tweet, York Theatre Royal chief executive Tom Bird made it clear the disgruntled punter had no chance of getting a refund.He wrote: Weaposve got a complaint this morning @YorkTheatre from someone who left after an hour of @NBroadsides #AsYouLikeIt last week, because it had aposYorkshire accentsapos in it.Thataposs Yorkshire accents, right here in Yorkshire. They want a refund.One Twitter user replied: Surely in the top  of ridiculous complaints Another said: Yorkshire accents, in Yorkshire, from a Yorkshire-based theatre company, that was SPECIFICALLY created to showcase Yorkshire accents in all roles  Heaven forbid. Others claimed the complaint fit a narrative that northern accents are less valued because theyaposre not received pronunciation. York Theatre Royal was approached for comment.

The miracle baby has been admitted to a hospital in the nearby city of Indore to be monitored by medics.  Mum Shaheen remains in the district hospital in Ratlam. It is unclear from reportsthe arrival is being treated as conjoined twins or one child. Local reports describe it as a baby but the condition is considered a rare form of partial twinning. One of the doctors, Dr. Lahoti, said: These kinds of cases are rare and the condition of babies remains uncertain, especially in the initial days. Due to this, we have kept them under observation. We have not planned for any surgery on the patient.  The doctors had told the parents that they have twins after conducting an ultrasound but were not aware of this condition. The third hand is towards the back between the two faces.In , a baby born with two heads has survived an operation operation to amputate the second head.Sana Hilel, from Aleppo, Syria, had her seventh child, Abdullat Shekrak, by Caesarean section after cranium bidum was detected in the womb.  Facing death, the baby was quickly transferred to Iskenderun Developmental Hospital where a brain, nerve and spinal surgery specialist removed the second head. Dr Mehmet Koparan, who performed the surgery, said a case this severe would often have been fatal. In general, encephaloceleis seen in one in , live births, he said. Grades three and four are less common, and often deadly. This case is grade three.

The discovery - which has been described as an extraordinary new benchmark - could help explain the evolution of the universe, experts hope.Over fty times bigger than the Sun, the staraposs light has only just reached Earth. Co-author Dr Selma de Mink, of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Germany, said: Itaposs kind of like finding an old photograph of your great-grandparents. These stars are basically our aposstellar ancestorsapos. We are, after all, made out of the elements they once produced. Yet we have so many unanswered questions.  Named Earendel, or morning star in Old English, it beats the previous record by almost four billion years. The observations - based on data collected by Hubble - are a huge leap further back in time. Co-author Dr Guillaume Mahler, of Durham University, said: This might be the earliest star we will ever see since the Big Bang. It was so surprising. It is so much younger than the previous entry of nine billion years - at first I didnapost believe it.It is believed to be one of the most massive stars out there - millions of times brighter than our own. Even so, Earendel would be impossible to spot at such a great distance without the aid of a huge cluster of galaxies that sit in its path. They warp the fabric of space - creating a powerful natural magnying glass that distorts and greatly amplies the light from distant objects behind. Dr Mahler said: Gravitational lensing is like observing galaxies under the microscope and with technology such as the Hubble telescope, you start to see what is inside.Thanks to the rare alignment Earendel appears virtually directly on a aposrippleapos - providing maximum illumination. It pops out from the general glow of its home galaxy - its brightness magnied by a factor of thousands. The effect is similar to little waves on the surface of a swimming pool - creating patterns of light on the bottom. They act as lenses - focusing sunlight. Lead author Brian Welch, a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said:We almost didnapost believe it at first - it was so much farther than the previous most distant star. Normally at these distances, entire galaxies look like small smudges. This galaxy has been magnied and distorted by gravitational lensing into a long crescent that we named the aposSunrise Arcapos. Studying Earendel will be a window into an era of the universe that we are unfamiliar with - but that led to everything we know. Itaposs like weaposve been reading a really interesting book but we started with the second chapter - and now we will have a chance to see how it all got started. Earendel is described in Nature. It will remain highly magnied for years to come as its infrared light is stretched by the universeaposs expansion. NASAaposs recently launched James Webb Space Telescopeis highly sensitive to these longer waves. Co-author Dr Dan Coe, of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said: With Webb we expect to confirm Earendel is indeed a star - as well as measure its brightness and temperature. We also expect to find the Sunrise Arc is lacking in heavy elements that form in subsequent generations of stars. This would suggest Earendel is a rare massive metal-poor star. Precise details of the star remain uncertain - something the authors say JWST will determine in the future. Dr de Mink added: Most exciting for me is some of the black holes recently detected by gravitational waves are remnants of stars that lived back then. I hope Earendel and future similar discoveries will help us understand a little more about the origin of these black holes.

I believe people have a certain fetish for something they canapost understand, and a lot of curiosity too. My look affects my romantic relationships a lot, I think because Iaposm still discovering myself. I am not a woman of many loves, and I have a strong personality, it gets in the way of my romances a lot.

But the one good thing to come out of it is reigniting the ­conversation around the payment of reparations.When slavery was abolished in , Britain paid £million, equal to % of its annual income, in ­compensation.However, the money, worth about £billion today, didn’t go to the victims of slavery. Instead it was paid to the powerful and rich slave owners who made their astronomical wealth off the back of this evil trade. People like John Gladstone, the father of prime minister William Gladstone, received £,, the equivalent of £million, in compensation for the , men, women and children regarded as his “property”. Samantha Cameron is a descendant of William Jollfe, a slave owner who received £,, around £million in today’s money, in compensation for his  slaves. Her husband, former prime minister David Cameron, also had slave owners in his family who were awarded thousands of pounds for their “loss”. In total some , slave-owning ­families received payment. Much of the £million “compensation” was borrowed – and the debt so huge it wasn’t paid off until . Which means that taxpayers until very recently were footing the bill – something the Treasury thought was an appropriate #FridayFact on Twitter. It’s shocking to think none of that money went to victims. The effects of slavery remain today. Almost  years later black people are battling racism and discrimination and fighting for justice and equality. You only have to look at how black people fleeing the war in Ukraine were treated to see how far we still have to go. The issue of reparations isn’t going away. If as a country we are truly sorry for Britain’s role in the slave trade, then the very least we can do is set up a commission to look at this seriously. It’s a process that is under way in Calornia. I’ve spoken to friends of Caribbean heritage, some of who say it’s not about the money, rather it’s about the ­willingness to accept that countries like Britain and America were built on the backs of slave labour and to say a proper sorry. No amount of money can make up for the hurt and the legacy of slavery but isn’t a meaningful conversation about reparations the least the victims of slavery and their descendants deserve  Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal FamilyPrince WilliamWilliam and KateCaribbeanRacismDavid CameronSamantha CameronDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was the latest possible barbaric war crime committed by Moscow’s troops amid growing doubt about Kremlin peace negotiations.The red cross building is in besieged port city Mariupol where officials warn a desperate humanitarian disaster is fast unfolding with thousands killed by Russia.Ukrainian ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said: “In Mariupol, the occupiers aimed at the building of the International Committee of the Red Cross .She said that on Wednesday the building came under fire even though its roof is marked with an internationally recognised Red Cross symbol.The symbol marks out that the structure holds wounded or ill people, or civilian or humanitarian cargo and is clearly visible from the air.  She added: “This is another war crime by the Russian Army in accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and a gross violation of the  Geneva Conventions.“I call on the world community to condemn the barbaric actions of the occupying country in shelling the ICRC building and to take measures to end the bloody war on the territory of Ukraine as soon as possible.” There is overwhelming evidence now of apartment buildings, residences, hospitals, cultural venues, and shopping malls destroyed by Russian bombs. As many as  people have been slaughtered by Russian airstrikes and shooting in Irpin, near Kyiv before the town was snatched back by Ukraine this week. Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn confirmed that he believed many bodies of victims still lie beneath the rubbled buildings. It was revealed by Ukraine today that  children have now died from Russian attacks and  have been wounded.  Ukrainian forces have repeatedly counter-attacked Russian troops around the capital and in other cities throughout the country, driving them back. Many observers and analysts believe Russian claims of a withdrawal from Kyiv and Chernihiv coincide with Moscow suffering huge losses. A former western intelligence officer told the Daily Mirror: “This is not about the Kremlin seriously negotiating a peace deal with Ukraine. “It is about Russia regrouping, consolidating, re-arming and forming new battle plans to try and bring Ukraine to its knees, whilst leaving it ruined. “The Kremlin knows its forces have been hammered with losses of more than , and there is huge cynicism about their intentions to negotiate.” London-based security sources added that their counterparts in the United States were also “highly doubtful” about Russian sincerity regarding peace. Today a former Ukrainian national security adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky cast doubt on Russian pledges to stop attacking Kyiv and Chernihiv.Moscow negotiators had suggested they will partially withdraw from the two cities as a gesture to gain trust from Ukrainian peace negotiators in Istanbul, Turkey. But Kyiv suffered a massive cyber attack within hours and by morning Ukraine announced there was “no evidence” of a Russian withdrawal.The capital’s Ministry of Defence reported a “massive” and “ongoing” cyber attack on its official website - with Russian hackers being prime suspects.Oleksander Danylyuk said the sound of shelling this morning had confirmed his fears.  He added: ”This is just regrouping,” and he added that Russia is “not going to ease their grab” on Kyiv and Chernihiv – “this is just words.” He continued: “As always there are military and diplomatic KGB games all combined, this is just one game.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky echoed fears that Moscow is not serious about de-escalating as peace talks continue. He said: “Yes, we can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive. But those signals don’t silence the explosions of Russian shells. “Of course we see the risks. Of course we don’t see any basis for trusting the words voiced by those or other representatives of the state that is continuing to fight for our destruction.” Mayor of Ukrainian city Ivano Frankivsk Ruslan Martsynkiv, told the Daily Mirror: “I do not believe the Russians intend to stop this attack - not at all. “Eventhere was a peace deal negotiated, they will start the war again within a year, maybe even sooner. Nobody believes them and why should they, given what they are doing ” Negotiations resumed this morning, five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead, almost four million Ukrainians fleeing the country and nearly ten million displaced.UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab has said UK sanctions against Russia will remain in place until the invasion of Ukraine is “withdrawn.”He added: “The sanctions are there to tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Red CrossInternational Committee of the Red Cross Ministry of DefenceInternational Criminal CourtRoman AbramovichVladimir PutinHospitalsWar crimesCrimeRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was formerly the director of LetterOne, a company that owns shares in health food company Holland  Barrett, before he stood down from the position earlier this month. Mr Fridman, who has lived in London for eight years, told Spanish news outlet El Pais that UK authorities should give him a “certain amount” to enable him to buy food and ride in a taxi. He acknowledged this would be a “very limited amount” in relation to the cost of living in London.  I can’t even pay in a restaurant,” he said. I have to eat at home and I am practically under house arrest. I’ve been in London for eight years, I’ve invested billions of dollars in Britain and other European countries and the answer to this is that they confiscate everything and throw me out.” Mr Fridman said the people who have been sanctioned would have toto Russia, where they would have “no choice but to be absolutely loyal”. There, they would continue to work, and would start businesses and create jobs, he said.Mr Fridman had previously expressed his views opposing Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine in an email to LetterOne Staff.He wrote about how the war would “cost lives and damage two nations”.  He wrote: I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years. While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end.” He said he was “sure” his partners would share his view. The UK’s Foreign Secretary Liz Trus last week announced  further sanctions, including the one imposed on Alfa-Bank. Earlier this month the UK hit iniduals, businesses and banks with sanctions in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Truss said: These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.  Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up. All those sanctioned today will have their assets in the UK frozen which means no UK citizen or company can do business with them, and iniduals subject to travel bans are also prohibited from travelling to or from the UK. Today’s sanctions will bring the total global asset value of the banks the UK has sanctioned since the invasion to £billion and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members in excess of £billion.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.It is getting no easier to plan and oversee public works these days.Council staff are to be congratulated for keeping the ious Mid Argyll projects broadly on track in the face of sharply rising costs and many other issues.We now look forward to the ious projects # and the Tarbert Harbour Authority scheme # coming to fruition.The generosity of Argyll folk in responding to the crisis in Ukraine is remarkable, yet not surprising.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We ran a local action plan to deal with this, resulting in a number of youths being taken home, tobacco and alcohol being confiscated and fixed penalty notices being issued.#In the coming months new CCTV systems are due to be installed in both Hermitage Park and Churchill Square which should act as a deterrent in these two sometimes problematic locations.#Road crime and road safety continues to be the focus of a large part of our operational activity.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition. Half are missing school. Millions are displaced. And none of them have ever known anything but war.One of my colleagues there, a -year-old man, tells me he has never seen peace in his letime.

Our approach in the charter very much aligns with the Scottish Government’s planning legislation.#It is not intended to be a punishment – it recognises that development is capable of gaining consent and being brought under control.#But where we have developments which are unacceptable, we would expect to act with the power that is required.#Councillor Colville then asked: #Is there any indication of officer time which is taken up  Is this a drain on our resources #Mr Bain responded: #It can be. We have an underlying enforcement caseload, as there are minor breaches of control which take an element of officers’ time, to take retrospective applications and serve notices.#We have a resource of two full-time officers and we are facilitating enforcement by drawing on planning officer time.#When we get signicant breaches of control, that will give rise to resources we don’t have on hand. We need to ert resources to deal with them because they are time-critical to deal with the parties involved.#The charter, circulated in advance of the meeting, states: #Planning permission is required for most development that takes place in Scotland, with the exception of some minor works.#However, developers or householders sometimes undertake work without planning permission or fail to comply with the terms of planning permissions.#The purpose of planning enforcement is to resolve a problem rather than to punish a mistake. Any action taken has to be appropriate to the scale of the breach.#Councils have discretionary powers to enforce planning controls in such cases,they consider it is in the public interest and expedient to do so having regard to a deemed assessment against the Local Development Plan and material planning considerations.#Councils also monitor certain developments to ensure planning controls are being followed.

settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA. Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

As traditional industries declined, new ones have developed and continue to, as Dundee reinvents itself as a city of innovation, culture and design. It’s the city of “Jute, Jam, Journalism – and now Joysticks”. In  Dundee was designated as a UNESCO city of Design for its contributions to art, medical research, comics and video games.The city’s plans for the next few years are bold and exciting. Dundee Esports Arena opens in , in the city that’s offered a degree in computer game design since and launched a dynamic new industry. The , seat venue aims to be the world’s best streaming venue, and will also bring more music and comedy events to Dundee. Eden Project Dundee is also aiming for , the exciting new project will be built on the former Dundee Gasworks and continue the rejuvenation of Dundee’s waterfront – and no doubt sharply increase visitors to the city.The opening of the dynamic VA has made waves in the Scottish art scene, but students, graduates and staff from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design have long put Dundee on the creative map. Situated in the heart of the DCA, Jute Café Bar is a bright, industrial style space. I choose a seafood platter which claims to be a light option: the heaving plate of crispy tempura squid, smoked salmon and chive brioche toast and gently spiced thai fishcakes tells a dferent but very enjoyable story. It’s a shame the big windows look out on a multi-storey carpark not the river beyond, but there’s plenty more to look at. I nab the seat beside ‘Artie the penguin’ and order a glass of Vinho Verde. I remember it’s a Monday and only just pm, but Artie doesn’t seem to mind.I’m staying at Hotel Indigo Dundee. This stylish hotel is in a converted jute mill and wears its heritage with pride. In the foyer there are lovingly curated mini exhibitions about the old and new Dundee industries, the perfect place to sink into a deep armchair and read a Beano. In the comfortable elegant bedrooms the little nods to the city are plentul – jute coloured curtains, marmalade cushions – and a very welcome jar to take home. Spot the ribbon edging in the room too – mine has a Dundee cake recipe, others have Grand Theft Auto cheat codes – I know which I could make better use of.Strolling around the city centre it’s clear that recent years and changing work patterns have hit local hospitality businesses hard, there are lots of empty units – but the ones that made it through are busy and there’s palpable potential. The pedestrianised areas are perfect for pavement dining. For a cosy café with a studenty feel, try Birchwood Emporium. The coffee is nice and strong and there’s a simple menu with a few interesting twists. The daily curry comes with a red rice, courgette salad and flatbread, and there are a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. A seat by the window was the perfect people-watching spot. I also liked Empire State Coffee. They carry a great range of Wild Hearth Bakery sourdough pastries, and serve up toasted bagels, soup and sandwiches.Near the art college Gallery  brings together authentic Spanish tapas and striking art exhibitions in a sunny stylish space. It’s the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine, order a few little dishes, and discover new up and coming artists.I keep spotting signs for ‘Peh’, even ‘Peh and Prosecco’. I’m fairly sure it’s a pie, but stop in at Scott Brothers Butchers to check. I’ve come to the right place. The butcher tells me a Scottie’s Peh is a classic Dundee pie – fillings range from classic Scotch or steak and gravy, to mince and baked beans. Scott Brothers have been perfecting their recipes since  and they sell over , a week. I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s Desperate Dan’s hometown after all. I get a quick lesson in ordering pehs and bridies in a Dundee accent too .In the evening we eat at Daisy Tasker, housed in the same former jute mill as Hotel Indigo. Daisy Tasker was a former mill worker who organised the social activities here – she would recognise many of the mill’s remaining original features . It’s a funky well-designed space with comfy booths to spend an evening, dimmer lights would add to the sophistication. House cocktails were on the sweet side but tasty – we opted for a Rhubarb Ginsecco and a Marmalade Cosmo. My beetroot salad was definitely trumped by my dining partner’s delightful Arbroath Smokie risotto. Polenta came with charred sweetcorn and tenderstem broccoli and hazelnuts but was a little style over substance with crunchy radishes confusing the palate. The duck with squash, savoy cabbage and figs was a better choice. The restaurant is a lively stylish spot with well trained and helpful young staff and clear skill in the kitchen. It doesn’t quite follow through on the local links the hotel is so proud of, but with a few tweaks could easily do so. I’d love to see more provenance on the menu, perhaps some Dundee marmalade rather than wee jam packets at breakfast, and I would definitely have chosen more Arbroath Smokie with my perfectly poached eggs over avocado.Ready for a nightcap we head into town, following whispers of asecret bar. We find the door in a dark alleyway and descend the steps to Draffens. This speakeasy style bar is the place for a real cocktail and would be a hit in any capital city. The menu is extensive and original, told through the story of a ’s Draffens department store catalogue. With leather booths, dark green walls and good music, both the drinks and the atmosphere are elegant and self-assured – with a sense of humour too. In the same building but a few floors up there’s sophisticated Italian style The Blue Room which I’llto for an Aperol Spritz next time.In between eating opportunities, and to work up an appetite, I take a hike up Dundee Law and enjoy the better understanding of the landscape the view from here gives. I also visit The McManus Gallery which brings together art and history – there’s a new exhibition bringing an old street to le that’s a lot of fun.  Don’t miss the incredible exhibition of photographs by Joseph McKenzie, a portrait of the changing city from -.For a last late lunch we try Tahini, a family run Lebanese restaurant that people across the city keep recommending. It’s on a quiet street with an unassuming entrance, but the enticing smells that hit as soon as I open the door make any doubt disappear. Be prepared, portions are large so it’s easy to over-order, but you’re unlikely to mind. The fattoush was bright and fresh with plenty of parsley, falafel were crisp and tasty with a garlic and tahini dip, the baba ganoush was deliciously smoky, and an enormous portion of crispy halloumi almost defeated us. The staff were delightful and with helpful recommendations, and surprised us with excellent baklava and figs.I can’t leave Dundee without a visit to iconic Fisher  Donaldson. With branches across Fe and Angus this family run business has been baking sweet treats for over a century and the fudge doughnuts are legendary. The café here is like stepping back in time, in a very good way. Also planned for my next trip is newbie Wrecking Ball Doughnuts, owned by MasterChef winner and chef patron of The Newport Restaurant Jamie Scott. On the same street The Cheesery is a brilliant deli and yes, cheese shop. The food and drink scene in Dundee isn’t perfectly executed, it isn’t fully gentried or Instagram-perfect. It’s friendly. Portions are generous and smiles are genuine, everyone I ask happily recommends their favourite places, and there are no cafés too achingly cool to be comfortable. Dundonians seem proud of their history, of where they’ve come from and where they’re going, and so they should be. The future is exciting – and delicious. Mine’s a peh. "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13630280.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-slave-trade-statues-let-public-decide-next-steps","story":"And just how the city reacts to a crucial report into Glasgow’s connections and subsequent wealth from the slave trade is something its citizens could have a say on.That is the view of both a leading charity on racial and equality rights and the chairman of a city council cross-party working group on slavery.Their comments come after the publication of the Glasgow Slavery Audit, which shows how the city’s wealth and growth stemmed from its involvement in the slave trade.Read more: Eight Glasgow statues singled out for links to slave trade, report revealedThe Glasgow City Council-commissioned report by Dr Stephen Mullen, an academic historian with the University of Glasgow, singled out eight Glasgow statues of iniduals with connections to the slave trade. It added that gts from those linked to the trade amounted to more than £ million in today’s money, with a bequest that would amount to £m for the Mitchell Library in . street names and areas linked to the slave trade have been highlighted in the report The monuments to Colin Campbell, William Gladstone, John Moore, David Livingstone, James Oswald, Robert Peel Jnr, James Watt and King William III are all highlighted in the report.Read more:  Glasgow street names and areas with links to slave tradeThe report also highlights  Glasgow streets and locations with connections to Atlantic slavery. These include Buchanan Street, named after Andrew Buchanan Jr, and Glassford Street, after tobacco lord John Glassford.Between  and ,  out of   lord provosts nominated to Glasgow Town Council had some connection to Atlantic slavery, and some sat in office whilst owning enslaved people.Councillor Graham Campbell, chairman of the council’s cross-party working group on slavery, said the report is a sobering reminder of just how deeply involved the city was in slavery, but he added it offers a  on what comes next.He said: “What I hope the report will do is give people the facts and that is really where Dr Mullen comes at with this. “You deal with the historical facts and what the archives show was the involvement of our merchants in tobacco, sugar, cotton, etc. “It is there and celebrated in the forms of street names so the visible evidence surrounds us.“Then it is a question of what do the citizens do with that knowledge. “The council slavery agreement working party has now spent more than a year meetings with historians, cultural archivists and the city heritage trust. We are consulting with communities impacted by racism and also the wider city.“When this committee later reconvenes for the new term, we hope the new councillors who are elected will take on board the work we have started. “What has perhaps been polarising in other places is not having preceded it with a grassroots, organised conversation from below backed up with scientic evidence.Once the report is more widely circulated, hopefully we will have a result which impacts upon the country’s and the city’s history of itself that we can correct and some of the misconceptions that are out there about the history of it.“It starts with awareness raising, atonement, acknowledgement and maybe then we might start to think about apologies. “We don’t want to have a tokenistic approach and that is the end of it. It would be pointless without an ongoing, engaging process of looking at that history and responding to it in some way such an anti-racism policy for the city, acknowledgement in our museums and our streets and also in the projects that we chose to run, cities we chose to link with. “Maybe linking with Kingston, that is one thing I would love to see us do.”Gallery of Modern Art was once a mansion owned by Lord William Cunninghame of Lainshaw Nelson Cummins, communities and campaigns officer for the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights, praised Dr Mullen for the report which he says shows how transatlantic and chattel slavery have been at the core of Glasgow as a city and its development as a city as well.He said: “We are still a city which struggles with racism in our key institutions and I think a report like this that gives us this historical context, it can almost create a thread where we can link it to present day issues that we have as well. “The actions to be taken on the back of this report are up to the people of Glasgow to decide.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

Commencing on Wednesday  March, Fun Factory Ballymena will host a series of quiet play sessions for autistic children, during which visitor entry numbers will be signicantly reduced, lighting will be dimmed and no loud music will be played. A six-month pilot of the initiative, which is supported by Council’s Community Planning Partnership, will see the sessions offered on the last Wednesday of every month between March and October from .pm to .pm . The sessions align with Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s strategy to make Mid and East Antrim an Autism Friendly Borough as part of its Community Plan. Partnering with a wide range of organisations, including The Fun Factory, Council is creating a strong, vibrant, safe and inclusive community in which local citizens, businesses and community organisations work together to improve the lives of everyone. Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park. These award accreditations were presented by Autism NI, in partnership with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust .Pamela, Manager of The Fun Factory, commented: “The Fun Factory is very much behind Council’s ambition to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for every person of every age, background and ability living in or visiting our Mid and East Antrim – it’s something we very much strive to achieve in our own business. “We passionately believe that every child deserves the chance to have a fun and enjoyable experience in an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable. Council has been fantastic in helping us to understand the challenges faced by autistic children and their families and supporting us to develop these new quiet play sessions.”For more information about the sessions, please visit www.thefunfactoryni.

The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs.

Credit: Andrew MilliganMark BainTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThousands of Rangers and Celtic football fans have been left with tickets for big matches in Scotland with one of their main routes of travel no longer possible.The impasse at PO Ferries means the regular sailings from Larne to Cairnryan are no longer operating, and fans who have paid out hundreds of pounds for season tickets, and who travelled every couple of weeks to Glasgow, have been left high and dry, unless they fork out for plane tickets or a secure a spot on a Stena ferry.And there’s a major problem looming over Easter weekend, with fans of both clubs hoping to travel at the same time for the Scottish Cup semi-final between the two Glasgow giants.This weekend, the North Ulster Federation of Rangers Supporters’ Clubs had been due to travel with several coaches to the Rangers v Celtic Scottish Premier League match at Ibrox Stadium — but there plans are in disarray.Charlie Connor, from the Limavady Rangers Supporters Club, said plans to travel this weekend have been abandoned by many.“There were several buses booked on PO this weekend but we got the call that the ferries would not be running and that it would be some time before they were.“All we could do is try to sell on our tickets. Some who had tickets for games have managed to get their cars booked onto the Stena service, but they’re few and far between.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We haven’t had any further information and simply can’t think what solution there is unless ferries start running again.”Colin Scott, from Lisburn Glasgow Rangers Supporters Club, said the issues with the PO sailings had caused a major headache.“It’s not just the lack of routes,” he said. “The cost is too much for many supporters and this weekend it’s virtually impossible to get a flight that can get you to the match in time for the noon kick-off.“We will have a major issue when Rangers are in the quarter-final of the Europa League against Braga on Wednesday, April . We have tickets, but we can’t get there.

We ask that all passengers ensure they book in advance online and check-in for their sailings within plenty of time before departure.”Rangers fans will by hit most by being unable to attend this weekend’s Old Firm derby, with local clubs getting more tickets for the home fixture than Celtic’s away support.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn FéinCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein voters PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John FinucaneMost ReadHow Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingWandering Castlewellan child ‘confirmed as safe’IRA and Sinn Fein spy Denis Donaldson ‘rejected offer of new le from his police handlers’Man ‘ashamed’ to be from Belfast after auntleft lying in street for four hours waiting for ambulanceBullitt hotel owner says two rooftop rooms ‘completely destroyed’ after accidental Babel fireTop VideosPlayThe third and final series of Derry Girls starts Tuesday th AprilPlayWomanlatest arrest in connection with Carrickfergus reservoir murderPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Irish Republican Socialist Party accuses electoral chiefs of preventing it from standing in Assembly pollSDLP election candidate Paul Doherty says he will not be deterred after being menaced by group of men on Shankill RoadSinn Fein will ‘defend, but not renegotiate’ Good Friday Agreement: O’NeillSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesProtocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceLatestNorthern Ireland man who threatened to kill New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern is jailed - Michael Cruickshank given one year in prisonUkrainian leader says country’s defence ‘at turning point’Hong Kong chief says resignation of UK judges is ‘political’Oil prices fall ‘as US mulls record release from crude reserves’US approves bison grazing on Montana prairie amid criticism,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Robert Reed said after his resignation from the Hong Kong court.“Nevertheless, I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the Supreme Court cannot continue to sit in Hong

resignations on Thursday and echoed Ms Lam’s political accusation.“The UK, under the flag of upholding Hong Kong’s legal system, flagrantly used political methods to interfere with and harm Hong Kong’s judicial system,” spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing.The security law, which outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion, has been used to arrest more than  pro-democracy figures, including the most prominent political leaders and activists.Since the law was imposed, Hong Kong police have raided critical media outlets, such as Apple Daily, which

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion.

It was owned by the Trufelli family since it opened in , and was sold last year.Last week it was announced that Curry’s were to resurrect the fun park.Owen Curry from Curry’s Fun Park said: “We are delighted to have secured such a prominent trading location that is very important to Portrush and the wider north coast area.“As a family that is synonymous with the leisure industry, we can appreciate what the Trufelli family brought to Portrush over the decades.“We look forward to building on that great foundation – Portrush is an iconic destination in Northern Ireland for locals and visitors alike. “We are very excited by the prospect of operating this legendary amusement park and we look forward to getting started.”l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Great news as busy Belfast route is reopened after ongoing incident   Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

Now that he has retired, it feels like the right time to celebrate his achievements and we’re thrilled that he’s given us his support to push forward with our redevelopment plans.”Rory’s chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children, will also benefit from the event.

That is why this election is so important.”Ulster Unionist South Belfast candidate Stephen McCarthy highlighted the “irony” of Sinn Fein choosing the Europa Hotel for their campaign launch. The Europa was once the most-bombed hotel in the world over three decades of terrorism.Mr McCarthy said: “A venue that was once a byword for all that was negative about Belfast and the violence that plagued us for so long, is now one of the premier venues of a rejuvenated city.“The irony of Sinn Fein holding a campaign launch in a hotel which the IRA tried to destroy repeatedly will certainly not be lost on many people in this city.“It is both sad and frustrating to think that had the republican movement chosen the political route  years ago, so many lives and so much destruction could have been spared.”TUV’s South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin described the Sinn Fein gathering at the Europa as a “grotesque spectacle” given the location and that they were meeting there “daring to ponticate about democracy and the will of the people”.Mr Girvin said: “There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein first minister upon Northern Ireland. The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein first minister.”He accused both the DUP and UUP of dodging a vital question: “Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O’Neill ”He continued: “TUV is unapologetic and clear on this matter. We will never provide a stooge deputy to a Sinn Fein first minister. If all unionist candidates were equally clear then we would go into the election confident in the knowledge that a republican first minister was an impossibility.“No-one who supports the current arrangements which deny the fundamentals of democracy – the right to vote a party out of government and the right to have an opposition to hold government to account – is in any position to give lectures. Least of all when they have displayed a willingness to deploy terrorism to achieve their political ends in the past.”Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill has vowed to defend but not renegotiate the Belfast Agreement. At the party’s election rally, Ms O’Neill labelled the DUP decision to pull out of the last Stormont Executive as “political vandalism”.The Sinn Fein vice-president warned that her party “will not be shting any goalposts to satisfy unionism before, or after the election”.She said the May  electoral contest was “the most important in a generation” and called on party members to “make history”. Ms O’Neill predicted that the majority of MLAs who are ed to the Assembly after May  will support the protocol.Sinn Fein is running  candidates across the  constituencies in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Alliance Party candidate in Lagan Valley, David Honeyford, has said it would be “morally unforgivable” for political leaders to fail to help people get through the cost-of-living crisis. Mr Honeyford said that despite the election the Executive could use future borrowing powers to support households.Sinn FeinMichelle ONeillGordon LyonsDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularRALLY BREAKDOWN: All the upcoming parades and protests against the Northern Ireland Brexit ProtocolGarda-IRA collusion question: ‘Refusal of Legacy Inquest for my brother confirms Dublin-IRA are untouchable for Troubles’Great news as girl ‘located safe and well’ | Community Search and Rescue and public ‘thanked for their help and support in locating this child’ during major search operation’We’re peaceful and law-abiding unionists – not rabble-rousers!Aileen Quinton: ‘Raising tensions ’ Time we put the blame where it belongs – violent offenders, not protocol protestorsMost PopularBest portable solar chargers for camping UK : keep your USB devices charged while backpacking and campingNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -yearsBest walking shoes for men UK : the best men’s shoes for hiking from Salomon, Inov-, and MerrellBest head torches UK : bright, reliable head torches for camping, hiking, and mountaineeringWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buy                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We’ve always kind of had the fear, will Labour take us in a particular direction closer to a united Ireland  But their bark about that and their actual bite has been very, very dferent.”Askedhe trusted Mr Johnson to resolve the Northern Ireland Protocol wrangling, he said: “I don’t trust anyone in politics, I’ve become really sceptical, and I think that it’s foolish to put your trust in people.“We can only trust the people, that they will hopefully elect sensible people, and then that we can trust those people to respond positively to the messages and the political policies that we have.“But the idea that I’m trusting this particular politician, I think those days have long since gone.”The full interview will be broadcast on GB News at .pm on Thursday, March .——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMajor changes to recycling have already been made in Barry and rural parts of the Vale of Glamorgan, with separate containers used for dferent materials.As a new recycling plant is set to open in Barry later this year, these changes are almost ready to roll out to the eastern parts of the Vale in October.Vale of Glamorgan council, which has the second best recycling rate in Wales, has set out a plan for the next decade on how to increase recycling rates further.Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the Vale’s recycling rates could even be some of the best in Europe.He said: “In – we recorded a recycling performance of . per cent, the second highest performance in Wales, and likely one of the highest performance figures in the UK and maybe even the EU. We have achieved this performance due to our change to source segregated kerbside recycling.“I can’t underestimate or over-exaggerate the herculean efforts of our residents, I really do appreciate that. However, about one third of our residents, those living in Penarth, Dinas and the other eastern Vale areas have not yet benefited from these new recycling arrangements and are still co-mingling their materials.”He was speaking during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March , when council bosses approved a new recycling and waste management business plan. Improving recycling rates forms a major part in the council’s decarbonisation plan, called Project Zero.Barry and western parts of the Vale already separate their recycling, with an orange bag for cardboard a white bag for paper a grey caddy for glass bottles and jars a blue bag for plastic, cans and cartons a green caddy for food waste and a green bag for garden waste.The changes were introduced in rural areas in October  and in Barry in October ..removePenarth and Dinas Powys and eastern parts of the Vale still mix recycling into a blue bag. The changes aim to improve the quality of recyclable materials, which is better for the environment and means the council gets a higher income from selling the material. Mixing recycling together can often mean the material is contaminated and unable to be recycled.A -week public consultation will be held in the summer on the new -year recycling plan, before it gets final approval. The changes will likely be introduced in October in Penarth, Dinas Powys, Llandough and Sully.Pembrokeshire has the highest recycling rate in Wales, with . per cent, and Cardf the lowest, with . per cent.Before the changes can be rolled out, work needs to be finished on a new recycling plant in Barry, as the current one in Cowbridge is at full capacity. The new plant is under construction at the Atlantic Trading Estate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The way he communicates as a coach, it’s been so refreshing and amazing to have him on board.“There’s criteria we have to meet, otherwise we don’t play and it’s as simple as that.

The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dddebbbaaadeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfcabadbccdaffca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.
