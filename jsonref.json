It doesn\u0027t seem a lot. If the PM had prorogued Parliament for a lengthy period until after October 31 — the day when we are supposed under existing law to leave the EU — that would have been a bad thing, as I suggested in these pages not long ago.But it is ridiculous to represent yesterday\u0027s announcement as an assault on the British constitution and the rule of law. In more ways than one, this Brexit business is driving the whole country bonkers.I do admit to registering a qualm or two that Boris Johnson is leaving the Commons less scope to exercise its democratic rights and come up with alternative proposals. But only a qualm or two. No more. Let me explain why.In the first place, MPs have had three years to agree a plan and have not yet done so. They\u0027ve debated and voted and argued for thousands of hours without being able to settle on a resolution which commands majority support.       The second reason I\u0027m not going to join a march in favour of MPs\u0027 rights is that under the new arrangements they will still have plenty of opportunity to upset Mr Johnson\u0027s applecart — if they are able to come up with a common strategy, which remains somewhat doubtful.When the Commons reassembles next Tuesday, the outraged Mr Bercow and the distraught Mr Grieve and the disgruntled Philip Hammond (until recently Chancellor of the Exchequer) will re-double their efforts to force the Prime Minister to postpone, or reverse, Brexit.Whether they will succeed is another matter because they may not have the numbers, and there are as many shades of Remainer opinion as there used to be varieties of Heinz. But they\u0027ll have their chance next week and the beginning of the following week, and after October 14.And Jeremy Corbyn (who disgracefully attempted to drag the poor Queen into this mess by demanding a meeting with her) can also have a shot and call a motion of No Confidence in the Government next week, or when the Commons returns.I wonder whether he will, though, because Labour is floundering in the polls, and would be unlikely to flourish in the election that would inevitably follow such a motion being passed.         Jeremy Corbyn can have a shot and call a motion of No Confidence in the Government next week, or when the Commons returnsBy the way, let me point out in a spirit of even-handedness that Remainers howling about the Prime Minister\u0027s unconstitutional behaviour are often the same people who have been preparing to bend, twist and otherwise ignore constitutional precedent by seizing power from the Government so that they can pack Boris Johnson off to Brussels to beg an extension.It was the spectacle of scheming Remainers on Tuesday, brewing up their latest plans to trip him up, that must have finally made up his mind to undertake some modest proroguing.So for all these reasons, I am keeping my qualms about this alleged democratic \u0027outrage\u0027 — a word as overused by Remainers as is \u0027catastrophic\u0027 in relation to No Deal — very firmly under control.But there is another powerful reason for gently applauding what the Prime Minister has done. Although the financial markets cannot see it (the pound sagged a little yesterday), suspending Parliament should make a deal more likely. For unless Remainer MPs succeed in their power-grab when the Commons briefly returns next week, the Government will have a clear run of just over four weeks during which it cannot be undermined by parliamentary shenanigans.       EU leaders and bureaucrats will no longer be able to vest their hopes in the idea that MPs are going to rescue them from the need to negotiate with No 10 over the Irish backstop.Over the past week there have been indications, particularly from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, that the once-sacrosanct Withdrawal Agreement can at least be partly revisited.And yet while Brussels believed there was a good chance that MPs would pull the rug from under Mr Johnson, there was no very strong reason for restarting serious negotiations.         Scottish Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon called him a ‘tin-pot dictator’As I\u0027ve argued, the Commons has not been irrevocably side-lined. But inasmuch as Remainer MPs and their incessant and often destructive plotting are absent from the battlefield during the next few weeks, so Boris Johnson will be able to enter unfettered talks with Brussels.Who knows, when the Queen\u0027s Speech is read out on October 14 to signal the beginning of a new session and the unveiling of the Government\u0027s legislative programme, there could be the outline of an agreement between the Government and the EU.At least there is a chance this will be so. And if the price that has to be paid is the loss of five or six days of Commons\u0027 sittings, I don\u0027t think very many people will shed copious tears, or buy the hysterical claptrap about our constitution being turned upside-down.Nor, while we are on the subject, should they be taken in by Remainer caterwauling about a supposed onslaught on democracy. Whatever small sliver of democratic accountability is being momentarily sacrificed pales into insignificance compared with the efforts of some Remainer MPs to undo the result of the referendum.Listen, for example, to the leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, who recently said she will never accept Brexit, even if the public were to vote for it again in a People\u0027s Vote. That is the voice of bigotry and extremism, not democracy.The truth is that Boris Johnson\u0027s proposal is modest and well-judged. I believe it edges us a little closer to a satisfactory agreement with Brussels, and therefore makes No Deal less probable.Will he succeed, or will he be consumed in the fires of Remainer vengeance? I obviously hope not, but I can\u0027t be sure. He is taking on almost the entire British Establishment, bishops included, in a courageous way.What I am convinced of is that he\u0027s as democratic as the next person and more democratic than most, and that all this talk of constitutional outrage is no more than self-serving Remainer tosh."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/28/23/17807576-0-image-a-2_1567032853874.jpg","title":"Coleen Rooney puts wedding ring Wayne fly UK","story":"Share this article   The Manchester United record goal scorer has been involved in a string of controversies involving alcohol, including an arrest for public intoxication at Dulles International airport in Washington DC last year.He had a court appearance for drink driving in 2017, when he drove party girl Laura Simpson, 30, in her VW Beetle in Cheshire while three times over the limit.He was handed a two-year driving ban and 100 hours of unpaid community work, apologising for an \u0027unforgivable lack of judgement\u0027.Coleen, then pregnant, and their other three sons, Kai, Klay and Kit, were on holiday in Spain at the time.In December he was taken into custody at Washington\u0027s Dulles airport, saying he was left \u0027disorientated\u0027 by prescribed sleeping tablets he took on a flight while drinking.He received a statutory automatic fine and was released shortly afterwards at the airport, a spokesman for Rooney said.In 2016 he was at the centre of another drinking row at a wedding reception between England games, later apologising \u0027unreservedly\u0027 for his behaviour.

They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines or on social media’Several years ago, when I was back home in Lithuania, I went to the beach for the first time in years. I grabbed my longboard, gathered a group of friends and family, and headed for one of the most popular spots on the Baltic coast.On this beach, there is a bridge that overlooks the shore. As I walked across it, I could see all of the bathers lying beneath me on the sand. I had a perfect bird’s eye view. I had never seen the beach from that angle, and it was fascinating. That evening, I began the research for this series, Comfort Zone. I looked through reams of beach photography, but pretty much none of the images had captured the scene from above. I found nothing documenting it from this angle in this clean, simple, almost clinical way.I wanted to create a typology of beach culture – a kind of study of the phenomenon as if I were investigating a different species. I was thinking about what it would be like to come to Earth as an alien and witness this: what sense would you make of it?As well as my camera, I used equipment to help me to shoot from above while I was moving around at beach level: a four-metre-long pole with an attachment for my camera, and a radio trigger for when I was ready to shoot.It was important that the photos were perfectly candid, so I didn’t tell anyone I was shooting them. But people were looking at me. I realised that the people who weren’t looking at me must be sleeping, so I knew which ones I wanted to photograph.I tried to avoid any conversations or arouse suspicion. I wasn’t doing anything against the law, but the beach is a place where people sometimes don’t feel comfortable being shot. Some people did approach me though – you can imagine seeing the same person every day walking with this strange thing on his shoulders, so they asked me what I was doing. I said I was just taking photos of nature, and if they were persistent with their questions, I would show them images I had taken of the sea or the forest.When those images started to be published, there were some concerns, and people questioned my practice. My view is that I’ve never focused on someone’s personal life: my work is about society, community, humanity – it’s not about one particular person.I took this shot on the first day I started to work on the series. It was nerve-racking: I had no idea how the pictures were going to look and I didn’t know how people would respond to me. That evening at home, I looked through the day’s work. Nothing was right apart from this shot. This image convinced me that the whole project was worth pursuing. For that reason alone, it’s special to me.The image tells a story: you can see the very shade of the woman’s lipstick, you can see the veins in her legs, but despite the specificity of the shot, it’s also oddly surreal. There’s a kind of dissonance in it that appeals to me.As in the rest of the series, the bodies you see are real. They are bodies you don’t often see in magazines, online or on social media. Every day we are bombarded with images of people eating perfectly healthy food and being perfectly in shape, and so many people feel excluded by that. The reality we are so often presented with is utterly distorted and represents the minority of us.I don’t consider the beach as a utopian escape from the city, but it does illustrate how our behaviour is conditioned by social norms beyond our control. Why is it acceptable to be half naked on a beach, but not in a library? Why does our environment dictate what we can and cannot wear? It’s because our behaviour is always being shaped by people around us.In the age of social media, we are obsessed with the concept of iniduality and the idea that we must all be different all of the time. These images show that, on some level, we just do what everyone else does. The inidual is much less important than the collective or the whole.I travelled to other beaches across the world, thinking it would be interesting to document how beach culture differs. What I found is that it doesn’t. We buy the same things, we often read the same things translated into whatever language we speak and we use the same brands a lot of the time.

There are three other farmers growing for us and we know that at least one other UK company is looking at production here.”Meldrum said the company was focusing on two broad categories of chickpea varieties: kabuli, which are the pale smooth round peas with which most of us are familiar, and desi, which have brown skins and are smaller and more wrinkled. Desi chickpeas are generally split and used to make chana dal and gram flour. Kabuli are canned or sold dried and sold whole, and also used to make chickpea flour (which has a significantly different flavour to gram flour).“Chickpeas are a marginal crop in the UK,” Meldrum said, “and when we first tried them they seemed very risky – more likely to fail than succeed. It feels like that’s changing and the likelihood of success is weighted slightly in our favour now. Five years ago we were looking at failed trial plots and wondering whether chickpeas were a step too far.”Two years ago the company launched the UK’s first commercial crops of lentils. That was followed last year by the first UK-grown chia seeds.The recent shift towards “clean eating” and veganism has meant that pulses, lentils, peas and beans are seeing something of a revival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9549827d640c5258b8a453df081944c9e52fe5d3/0_187_4592_2754/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7128b5f6890861268d1f2e9eb24630e8","title":"no real security why dont houseboat residents get rights like other tenants","story":"More people in the UK are opting to live on houseboats than ever before, but without the same protections as house renters – leaving them vulnerableTideway Village is just four houseboats on the Thames in Vauxhall, home to around 20 people, but with its flowering shrubs, trees and plants, and a self-watering system, it forms an appealing bankside community right in the heart of London.David Waterhouse, 67, founded it nearly 20 years ago on what was a derelict site, a dumping ground for supermarket trolleys and scrap metal. A former sailor and ship’s carpenter who grew up in Surrey, Waterhouse moved on to an abandoned barge, won planning consent and licences, and set up services including water and electricity.In 2010, however, the developer St James proposed a wholesale overhaul: it would get rid of the boats, and the people living there, and replace them with a floating garden, part of an imposing riverside residential development designed by Richard Rogers’ firm.For three years, Waterhouse fought the eviction. His campaign included an e-petition, a statement of support from Boris Johnson (then mayor of London) and a protest outside Wandsworth Council’s offices. Waterhouse even dressed up as the Milk Tray man to lobby the developer in its head office at the Berkeley Group.Eventually, Waterhouse won: he convinced the developer that the vibrant houseboat community could be a local attraction in its own right, bringing customers to the new shops, restaurants and cafes.“People see the boats and want to come in and see what’s going on,” he says. “It’s regarded as a plus now.” Another developer, Barratt Homes, even asked the Tideway Village residents to participate in a promotional film to help sell nearby flats. “A really ironic twist,” he says.Despite the success, Waterhouse is troubled by the experience. “It shouldn’t be necessary to go through all that and three years of stress in order to survive,” he says. Worse, the future remains uncertain: at any time, the developer could sell the freehold, and the fight could start all over again. “We are at the mercy of whoever owns the ground rent of the development alongside us,” he says. “And we have no real security beyond that.”It is a situation faced by most houseboat communities, who may own their boats but not the moorings, and therefore have no legal right to stay. Unlike owners of houses or apartments, houseboat owners have no security of tenure: although they pay council tax, energy, water and insurance bills, they do not have the same statutory rights as other tenants. As a result, they have little redress when the owners of moorings propose to increase fees or develop the site.“Over many years, layers of statutory regulation have protected residential tenants from what would otherwise be a very unequal relationship by granting them rights against their landlord or by limiting the landlord’s rights as owners of the home,” explains Amanda Burge, head of dispute resolution at international law firm Hamlins. “The legal relationship when a boat owner moors a boat at a mooring is usually a completely different one and so the statutory regulation simply does not apply.“The situation faced by houseboat owners is not dissimilar to the one faced by mobile home residents – but while there is legislation designed to provide some protections to them, there is nothing at all that is designed to apply to residential houseboats.”The story is played out on moorings across the country. At Chelsea Reach, Burge is helping houseboat owners fight a court battle against Chelsea Yacht and Boat Company (CYBC), which runs their moorings. A historic community that dates back to the 1930s, Chelsea Reach has a charm all its own: the tidal flats between Battersea Bridge and Lots Road attract wildlife including cormorants and herons, and the community was the setting for Penelope Fitzgerald’s Booker prize-winning novel Offshore, as well as a popular film and TV location the Peter Sellers film The Naked Truth and the 1970s television series The Sweeney both filmed scenes there.Three years ago, however, new owners of the moorings proposed to triple the cost of the licence. The boat owners claim the company is in breach of its agreement with the Port of London Authority, which they say allows CYBC to charge maintenance and mooring fees but not a licence premium. CYBC told  Cities the charge was based on “independently assessed fair market value”, that the moorings were not under threat, and that any new boats would be “characterful, well maintained and sensitive to the area”.Back in 2011, on the Isle of Wight, after new owners terminated their licences, boat owners in Bembridge Harbour argued that their houseboats qualified as “dwelling houses” under the Housing Act. Their High Court appeal was unsuccessful: the law states that a house must be attached to land, and the court ruled that the houseboats were chattels – movable property – and therefore not eligible for protection under the law.Janet Just’s houseboat was not movable property at all: her home, like some others in the harbour, rested on wooden platforms and was not seaworthy. She had been living in Bembridge Harbour since 1988, and when the new owner demanded that the houseboat owners buy leases to their plots, she couldn’t afford to pay. The plot was sold at auction and her boat was demolished after she lost the court case. “It’s heartbreaking,” she recalls. “I spent a fortune on doing it up. I walked away with nothing. Not a single solitary penny.“You can live 30 or 40 years on a boat and then someone comes along and says if you don’t pay xyz we’re going to evict you. And that shouldn’t be possible,” she says. “The landing craft had been non-floaters for 50 years. They were attached to all mains services and paid council tax like any other house. They had been doing so for a lot longer than many houses in Bembridge.”Her neighbour in the harbour, Christopher Mew, took a sledgehammer to the interior of his houseboat after they lost the legal action, destroying the wooden fittings in order to stop the bailiffs taking his property.Many tenants in houses and apartments rent under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, which gives them various rights, although not to complain or contest the rent tenants with an assured periodic tenancy can challenge a rent increase. Houseboat owners, however, have no such regulations to rely on when it comes to mooring.Waterhouse believes the lack of legislation is holding back the possibility of not just low-cost housing but the broader recreational use of the Thames. He has bought a bargeyard in Rotherhithe that he says he is unable to develop for houseboat moorings, because the lack of security for tenants is deterring investment.“It could become a wonderful marina village and we can’t do it at the moment for two reasons. One is the fact that we would have to raise the money to put in the infrastructure, and you can’t raise money from a bank very easily because you don’t have any security of tenure from the Port of London Authority,” he says.“The second element: you can sell off moorings before or when they become available to finance that development, but nobody is going to want to do that if they’ve got no security of tenure on the mooring they’re buying. It has a complete knock-on effect.“If you want to create investment, to provide good-quality relatively cheap accommodation in London, there is fantastic opportunity for it,” Waterhouse adds. “It’s the last bit of landscape that doesn’t have proper legislation to help it become what it could.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d3f85a50ceb556bbefb932bafd262c8f40a88e/0_126_2623_1574/master/2623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c4ea5b5f6c3d13cb93c95bae8b05646","title":"children housing estate chelmsley wood birmingham","story":"Don’t let anyone ever tell you that you have to come from a place to belong there. Just because the place you grew up in lives inside you, it doesn’t mean you have to like it, or defend it, or define every other place against it. Birmingham, where I come from, inhabits my accent and underlies my compulsive self-deprecation, but apart from that, my Brummie-ness feels like an accident. (Even so, I’m obsessed with it.)The centripetal Midlands happens to be where the Welsh, Irish and English strands of my family combined, having moved, as humans do, where there are prospects for a better life. The centre drew them in, then cast them to the periphery as Birmingham built outwards in concentric circles following the first world war. I grew up in Chelmsley Wood, on a vast estate built on green belt land outside the city boundaries where, a Birmingham Post reporter predicted in 1971, “the city will feel a million life-miles away” to the children who would come to be raised there.Well, it did and didn’t. The centre of Birmingham was nine miles away, to be exact: far enough to feel distant but ever-present in our voices. Every weekend we would catch the bus, which took 50 minutes each way, just to renew the connection. Chelmsley Wood was as big as one of the postwar new towns, but without the official designation and without a corresponding sense of identity and purpose. Instead it was “overspill”: yuck. Like a pan of boiled milk in need of mopping up.Such terms didn’t bother my nan, who felt she had arrived in paradise when she was offered a home to rent in 1969. But they bothered me. For her, the quality of the house counted most she contrasted it with the cellar she had grown up in. I had never known anything other than boxy 60s houses with central heating, and as a result directed my discontent at the landscape in which they were set.Why were we so far from the city, where everything was happening? Why did our teachers live somewhere else, driving in and out every day as if visiting quarantined patients? Was there something wrong with us? I never escaped that feeling, so I escaped the place instead – physically, though never mentally. I moved to London for university and never came back to live, but shuttled back every two or three weeks to see my parents, watching it change and stay the same.For nearly 20 years, I did it out of duty, not for pleasure. I was always conscious that I had done that supremely cliched thing – I’d “got out” and given nothing back, not even a new perspective on the place that shaped how I felt about every other place. It was only when I had children, in my late 30s, that my mental map of Chelmsley Wood changed. Having moved from London to Liverpool, our regular journey back to the Midlands became one from north to south and not the other way around.To my children, this was a place and a space that had none of the baggage I’d left with at 18. The pure joy they got from trips to the park in the centre of the estate gave me a chance to remember the things I’d loved. They don’t know what estates are: I remember a time when I didn’t know what one was either, in spite of living on one.At the back of the park, the giant slide with 37 steps was still there, and so were the brambles. The lake was still smelly and full of mallards, unchanged across decades. Then, in 2012, when my son had just started walking, we came across something new. In another corner of the park a giant climbing structure had appeared, with tunnels, frames and rope swings created as if out of thin air. It was an adventure playground – a proper one, of the kind you could imagine mucky kids in flares and tank tops emerging out of to ride home on Chopper bikes.My son got stuck into the sandpit, pouring water down funnels made of old guttering and splodging paint over planks of wood. The older kids pushed him, and later his younger sister, in the basket swings. Every time we came back, it had changed – improved and augmented by the children who used it in cooperation with the small staff of playworkers and volunteers, working together to make the place better.We go there every school holiday now. My children march around telling everyone, “We’re from Liverpool and we’re visiting our nanny’s house!” Being Scousers, their sense of place is strong and very positive. I envy them that, of course, but I’m – to use a Scouse phrase – made up to know they are happy in both places. When we are at the playground it feels as though my children have regained the paradise my nan saw in Chelmsley Wood when it was brand new. A place of freedom and freshness, where there is nothing to be afraid of, or to escape from.• Lynsey Hanley is the author of Estates: an Intimate History, and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a25026ea7779e1ee0f8ca4d69786faaa69680b8a/0_311_5685_3410/master/5685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83c31a78e59d9b8574e114d24156b952","title":"far right fred perry mainstream fashion camouflage brands","story":"Brands are facing unwanted endorsements from a younger generation of neo-Nazis attempting to normalise extreme ideasThe Fred Perry brand found itself in the unwelcome spotlight this week when one of its brand ambassadors tweeted that he would no longer wear Fred Perry clothing in the US, now that the self-described “western chauvinist” Proud Boys group have adopted the black-and-yellow striped polo shirts as their unofficial uniform. The company has repeatedly distanced itself from the Proud Boys, describing them as “counter to our beliefs and the people we work with”.But the problem is bigger than Fred Perry alone. There are dozens of other brands today that are either intentionally selling clothing with far-right messaging or have been co-opted by the far right because of the symbolic resonance of their logos. This isn’t entirely new: the British brand Lonsdale became popular in German far-right scenes decades ago, for example, when youth discovered that a half-zipped bomber jacket over a Lonsdale T-shirt displayed the letters “NSDA” – the first four letters of the German initials of the Nazi party.The past few years have seen a dramatic shift in the aesthetics of far-right extremism, as the far right has all but abandoned the shaved heads and combat boots of racist skinheads in favour of a broader style that blends in with the mainstream. The new aesthetic includes T-shirts and hoodies laced with coded far-right symbols sold by for-profit brands as well as the suits, jeans and haircuts popularised by the American “alt right”.Smartness of dress has long been a far-right smokescreen: Hugo Boss, after all, manufactured the Nazi party’s brown shirts and uniforms, using pristine tailoring to mark a stark departure from the combat fatigues and drab colours typically favoured by armies. The Nazis wanted fashion to communicate military strength and aggression. The shaved heads, bomber jackets and combat boots that postwar neo-Nazis co-opted from British working-class youth in the 1980s aimed for the same aggressive impression, creating a uniform aesthetic that would come to dominate the far-right’s youth scene for three decades. You can’t blame observers, then, for being surprised by the pressed khakis and white polo shirts worn by dozens of young men bearing flaming torches and chanting “Jews will not replace us” as they marched in Charlottesville in 2017. But the clean-cut look wasn’t coincidental. Far-right leaders knew all too well that the public would struggle to connect hate with a style of dress that looked more like the kid next door than the neo-Nazi of their imagination. So in the days leading up to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, a prominent neo-Nazi blogger instructed marchers to dress respectably, noting that their appearance was more important than their ideas in getting people to listen.The transformation in aesthetics and style is part of a deliberate, top-down tactic on the part of the far right to appear more mainstream in order to make the public more receptive to their ideas. This shift normalises and disrupts the public’s ideas about what extremists look like and makes it harder to interpret and recognise the far right’s ideas as extreme.The strategy wouldn’t have worked if it weren’t so appealing to a younger generation of people open to the far right but eager to shed the stigma of the skinhead look and blend into the mainstream. Having come of age in the social media era, young people are hyper-conscious about their own appearance and personal brand. Mainstreaming the aesthetic not only helps soften the far right’s message to outsiders, but also changes the conception of outsider and insider – enabling people to slip in and out of far-right modes in ways that would have been impossible in the past.Today’s far-right youth can be mainstream in their appearance, but extreme in their ideas. This is a radical change from the racist skinhead era, when the far right’s “uniform” aesthetic made extreme ideological views more transparent to teachers, employers, parents and peers.What should companies do when they are co-opted by groups they find abhorrent? Typical strategies for brands have included formally distancing themselves from violent or ideologically extreme groups or trying to hire celebrity influencers to reclaim the brand. Such tactics have mixed success.Instead, companies can take a cue from Lonsdale’s approach. After Lonsdale was co-opted by German far-right youth, the company refused to deliver clothing to shops associated with the far-right scene, funded counter-far right programmes and launched a pro-tolerance campaign: “Lonsdale loves all colours”. In turn, anti-racist supporters decided they should support Lonsdale and started wearing the brand. This effectively disrupted the significance of the logo, making it impossible to identify only with the far right.Brand ambassadors and consumers can put pressure on companies to do more than issue public statements disavowing the values and actions of extremist groups who favour their products. Using the profits they earn from those groups to fund initiatives that counter hate is one place to start.• Cynthia Miller-Idriss is professor of education and sociology at the American University in Washington, DC, and author of The Extreme Gone Mainstream"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e9b3a2249b6acfd442995ad908ead5198aa39f/0_0_4450_2671/master/4450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b44d274521a5d16946b9515249b9a5c","title":"i have been begged to do strictly come dancing heres why i turned it down","story":"There were more reasons for me not to take part than there are sequins on all the outfits of all the ballroom dancers in the worldOnce upon a time, when I was presenting The One Show, I used to get asked – begged, even – to do Strictly Come Dancing. On one occasion, a couple of channel executives, who have since moved on, took me to dinner to try to talk me into it. They even pulled out glossy 10x8 photographs of the new professional dancers. I am sure this wasn’t their intention – they were just trying to enthuse me about the whole production – but to anyone looking on from another table it must have looked as though they were inviting me to take my pick.There were more reasons for me not to do Strictly than there are sequins on all the outfits of all the ballroom dancers in the whole wide world. It is not so much the dancing itself. In fact, I am a quite brilliant dancer. My problem is that I can do it only when no one is watching – not even me. Seriously: I can’t even look at myself in the mirror doing it. One day this summer, I was looking after my friend’s cockapoo, Hugo, and, close though we are, I couldn’t dance in front of him. I went to pieces.But, home alone, shimmying around beautifully, I know I am a simply superb mover. It is just that, as soon as a set of eyeballs alights on me, it is game over. As for actual dancefloors, I become paralysed with shame and embarrassment, quite unable to move at all.The thing I find especially difficult is the process of taking to the floor the transition between not dancing (ie walking) and dancing. It just seems ludicrous to me, if not as ludicrous as the opposite transition, between dancing and not dancing. Do you just stop abruptly? Or try to segue from a dance to a walk? It is too much for me to contend with.As I say, though, the problem with Strictly wouldn’t have been the dancing. Given enough practice, I could have had a bash. At least there are definite starting and stopping points to every routine, so my transition anxiety wouldn’t come into it. No, it is all the smiling that I couldn’t manage.How do they do it? I find it hard to smile at the best of times, especially while I am concentrating. I do a lot of inward smiling, but that is no good for anything but a scowly tango. As for those outfits, I can’t abide anything see-through, tight or glittery. Just writing those words has me goosefleshing all over.And one other thing: a famous young male TV presenter who had previously been on Strictly once took me aside and said: “Look, what you’ve got to understand is that it’s impossible to be rubbing up so close to your partner without getting aroused.” I like to think this wouldn’t have been the case with me. However, every time I hear that theme music, a mental image of myself dad-dances into view. I am smiling grotesquely, dancing incompetently and plainly struggling with the, er, tightness of my costume. It is horrible.Anyway, back in the day, I ran the idea of going on Strictly past my kids. “No, no, no,” they said. “Absolutely not.” It was a good call.•Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/752b2c1aa8c3ceb3f5bc74d28ac83b78281ae674/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78f74a3c8df9fec4b6b9a78616a3886a","title":"the air conditioning trap how cold air is heating the world","story":"The warmer it gets, the more we use air conditioning. The more we use air conditioning, the warmer it gets. Is there any way out of this trap? By  Stephen BuranyiOn a sweltering Thursday evening in Manhattan last month, people across New York City were preparing for what meteorologists predicted would be the hottest weekend of the year. Over the past two decades, every record for peak electricity use in the city has occurred during a heatwave, as millions of people turn on their air conditioning units at the same time. And so, at the midtown headquarters of Con Edison, the company that supplies more than 10 million people in the New York area with electricity, employees were busy turning a conference room on the 19th floor into an emergency command centre.Inside the conference room, close to 80 engineers and company executives, joined by representatives of the city’s emergency management department, monitored the status of the city power grid, directed ground crews and watched a set of dials displaying each borough’s electricity use tick upward. “It’s like the bridge in Star Trek in there,” Anthony Suozzo, a former senior system operator with the company, told me. “You’ve got all hands on deck, they’re telling Scotty to fix things, the system is running at max capacity.”Power grids are measured by the amount of electricity that can pass through them at any one time. Con Edison’s grid, with 62 power substations and more than 130,000 miles of power lines and cables across New York City and Westchester County, can deliver 13,400MW every second. This is roughly equivalent to 18m horsepower.On a regular day, New York City demands around 10,000MW every second during a heatwave, that figure can exceed 13,000MW. “Do the math, whatever that gap is, is the AC,” Michael Clendenin, a company spokesman, told me. The combination of high demand and extreme temperature can cause parts of the system to overheat and fail, leading to blackouts. In 2006, equipment failure left 175,000 people in Queens without power for a week, during a heatwave that killed 40 people.This year, by the evening of Sunday 21 July, with temperatures above 36C (97F) and demand at more than 12,000MW every second, Con Edison cut power to 50,000 customers in Brooklyn and Queens for 24 hours, afraid that parts of the nearby grid were close to collapse, which could have left hundreds of thousands of people without power for days. The state had to send in police to help residents, and Con Edison crews dispensed dry ice for people to cool their homes.All of these reports note the awful irony of this feedback loop: warmer temperatures lead to more air conditioning more air conditioning leads to warmer temperatures. The problem posed by air conditioning resembles, in miniature, the problem we face in tackling the climate crisis. The solutions that we reach for most easily only bind us closer to the original problem.The global dominance of air conditioning was not inevitable. As recently as 1990, there were only about 400m air conditioning units in the world, mostly in the US. Originally built for industrial use, air conditioning eventually came to be seen as essential, a symbol of modernity and comfort. Then air conditioning went global. Today, as with other drivers of the climate crisis, we race to find solutions – and puzzle over how we ended up so closely tied to a technology that turns out to be drowning us.Like the aqueduct or the automobile, air conditioning is a technology that transformed the world. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of independent Singapore, called it “one of the signal inventions of history” that allowed the rapid modernisation of his tropical country. In 1998, the American academic Richard Nathan told the New York Times that, along with the “civil rights revolution”, air conditioning had been the biggest factor in changing American demography and politics over the previous three decades, enabling extensive residential development in the very hot, and very conservative, American south.A century ago, few would have predicted this. For the first 50 years of its existence, air conditioning was mainly restricted to factories and a handful of public spaces. The initial invention is credited to Willis Carrier, an American engineer at a heating and ventilation company, who was tasked in 1902 with reducing humidity in a Brooklyn printing factory. Today we assume that the purpose of air conditioning is to reduce heat, but engineers at the time weren’t solely concerned with temperature. They wanted to create the most stable possible conditions for industrial production – and in a print factory, humidity curled sheets of paper and smudged ink.Carrier realised that removing heat from the factory air would reduce humidity, and so he borrowed technology from the nascent refrigeration industry to create what was, and still is, essentially a jacked-up fridge. Then as now, air conditioning units work by breathing in warm air, passing it across a cold surface, and exhaling cool, dry air. The invention was an immediate success with industry – textile, ammunition, and pharmaceutical factories were among the first adopters – and then began to catch on elsewhere. The House of Representatives installed air conditioning in 1928, followed by the White House and the Senate in 1929. But during this period, most Americans encountered air conditioning only in places such as theatres or department stores, where it was seen as a delightful novelty.It wasn’t until the late 1940s, when it began to enter people’s homes, that the air conditioner really conquered the US. Before then, according to the historian Gail Cooper, the industry had struggled to convince the public that air conditioning was a necessity, rather than a luxury. In her definitive account of the early days of the industry, Air-Conditioning America, Cooper notes that magazines described air conditioning as a flop with consumers. Fortune called it “a prime public disappointment of the 1930s”. By 1938 only one out of every 400 American homes had an air conditioner today it is closer to nine out of 10.What fuelled the rise of the air conditioning was not a sudden explosion in consumer demand, but the influence of the industries behind the great postwar housing boom. Between 1946 and 1965, 31m new homes were constructed in the US, and for the people building those houses, air conditioning was a godsend. Architects and construction companies no longer had to worry much about differences in climate – they could sell the same style of home just as easily in New Mexico as in Delaware. The prevailing mentality was that just about any problems caused by hot climates, cheap building materials, shoddy design or poor city planning could be overcome, as the American Institute of Architects wrote in 1973, “by the brute application of more air conditioning”. As Cooper writes, “Architects, builders and bankers accepted air conditioning first, and consumers were faced with a fait accompli that they merely had to ratify.”Equally essential to the rise of the air conditioner were electric utilities – the companies that operate power plants and sell electricity to consumers. Electric utilities benefit from every new house hooked up to their grid, but throughout the early 20th century they were also looking for ways to get these new customers to use even more electricity in their homes. This process was known as “load building”, after the industry term (load) for the amount of electricity used at any one time. “The cost of electricity was low, which was fine by the utilities. They simply increased demand, and encouraged customers to use more electricity so they could keep expanding and building new power plants,” says Richard Hirsh, a historian of technology at Virginia Tech.At the same time, air-conditioning-hungry commercial buildings were springing up across the US. The all-glass skyscraper, a building style that, because of its poor reflective properties and lack of ventilation, often requires more than half its electricity output be reserved for air conditioning, became an American mainstay. Between 1950 and 1970 the average electricity used per square foot in commercial buildings more than doubled. New York’s World Trade Center, completed in 1974, had what was then the world’s largest AC unit, with nine enormous engines and more than 270km of piping for cooling and heating. Commentators at the time noted that it used the same amount of electricity each day as the nearby city of Schenectady, population 80,000.The postwar building spree was underpinned by the idea that all of these new buildings would consume incredible amounts of power, and that this would not present any serious problems in the future. In 1992, the journal Energy and Buildings published an article by the British conservative academic Gwyn Prins, arguing that the American addiction to air conditioning was a symbol of its profound decadence. Prins summarised America’s guiding credo as: “We shall be cool, our plates shall overflow and gas shall be $1 a gallon, Amen.”During the time that air conditioning was reshaping America’s cities, it had little effect elsewhere. (With some exceptions – Japan, Australia and Singapore were early adopters.) Now, however, air conditioning is finally sweeping across the rest of the world. If the march of air conditioning across the US tracked its postwar building and consumption boom, its more recent expansion has followed the course of globalisation. As the rest of the world adopts more Americanised ways of building and living, air conditioning follows.In the 1990s, many countries across Asia opened up to foreign investment and embarked on an unprecedented urban building spree. Over the past three decades, about 200 million people in India have moved to cities in China, the number is more than 500 million. From New Delhi to Shanghai, heavily air-conditioned office buildings, hotels and malls began to spring up. These buildings were not only indistinguishable from those in New York or London, but were often constructed by the same builders and architects. “When you had this money coming in from the rest of the world for high-end buildings, it often came with an American or European designer or consultancy attached,” says Ashok Lall, an Indian architect who focuses on housing and low-energy design. “And so it comes as a package with AC. They thought that meant progress.”As the rate and scale of building intensified, traditional architectural methods for mitigating hot temperatures were jettisoned. Leena Thomas, an Indian professor of architecture at the University of Technology in Sydney, told me that in Delhi in the early 1990s older forms of building design – which had dealt with heat through window screens, or facades and brise-soleils – were slowly displaced by American or European styles. “I would say that this international style has a lot to answer for,” she said. Just like the US in the 20th century, but on an even greater scale, homes and offices were increasingly being built in such a way that made air conditioning indispensable. “Developers were building without thinking,” says Rajan Rawal, a professor of architecture and city planning at Cept University in Ahmedabad. “The speed of construction that was required created pressure. So they simply built and relied on technology to fix it later.”Lall says that even with affordable housing it is possible to reduce the need for air conditioning by designing carefully. “You balance the sizes of opening, the area of the wall, the thermal properties, and shading, the orientation,” he says. But he argues that, in general, developers are not interested. “Even little things like adequate shading and insulation in the rooftop are resisted. The builders don’t appear to see any value in this. They want 10- to 20-storey blocks close to one another. That’s just how business works now, that’s what the cities are forcing us to do. It’s all driven by speculation and land value.”This reliance on air conditioning is a symptom of what the Chinese art critic Hou Hanru has called the epoch of post-planning. Today, planning as we traditionally think of it – centralised, methodical, preceding development – is vanishingly rare. Markets dictate and allocate development at incredible speed, and for the actual inhabitants, the conditions they require to live are sourced later, in a piecemeal fashion. “You see these immense towers go up, and they’re already locking the need for air conditioning into the building,” says Marlyne Sahakian, a sociologist who studies the use of air conditioning in the Philippines.Over coffee recently in London, the influential Malaysian architect Ken Yeang lamented what he viewed as the loss of an entire generation of architects and builders to a dependency on fossil fuels to control the environment. “So much damage has been done by those buildings,” he says, “I have entirely lost hope in my generation perhaps the next one can design a rescue mission.”To its proponents, air conditioning is often presented as a simple choice that consumers make to improve their lives as they climb the economic ladder. “It’s no longer a luxury product but a necessity,” an executive at the Indian branch of the Japanese air-conditioner manufacturing giant Daikin told the Associated Press last year. “Everyone deserves AC.”This refrain is as familiar in Rajasthan now as it was in the US 70 years ago. Once air conditioning is embedded in people’s lives, they tend to want to keep it. But that fact obscures the ways that consumers’ choices are shaped by forces beyond their control. In her 1967 book Vietnam, Mary McCarthy reflected on this subtle restriction of choice in American life. “In American hotel rooms,” she wrote, “you can decide whether or not to turn on the air conditioning (that is your business), but you cannot open the window.”One step towards solving the problem presented by air conditioning – and one that doesn’t require a complete overhaul of the modern city – would be to build a better air conditioner. There is plenty of room for improvement. The invention of air conditioning predates both the first aeroplane and the first public radio broadcast, and the underlying technology has not changed much since 1902. “Everything is still based on the vapour compression cycle same as a refrigerator. It’s effectively the same process as a century ago,” says Colin Goodwin, the technical director of the Building Services Research and Information Association. “What has happened is we’ve expanded the affordability of the air conditioner, but as far as efficiency, they’ve improved but they haven’t leaped.”One scheme to encourage engineers to build a more efficient air conditioner was launched last year by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), a US-based energy policy thinktank, and endorsed by the UN environment programme and government of India. They are offering $3m to the winner of the inaugural Global Cooling prize. The aim is to design an air conditioner that is five times more efficient than the current standard model, but which costs no more than twice as much money to produce. They have received more than a hundred entries, from lone inventors to prominent universities, and even research teams from multibillion-dollar appliance giants.“This idea of technology saving us is a narrative that we want to believe. Its simplicity is comforting,” he says. It has proven so comforting, in fact, that it is often discussed as if it is our first and best response to climate change – even as the timeframe for inventing and implementing such technologies becomes so narrow as to strain credulity.New air-conditioner technology would be welcome, but it is perhaps “the fourth, or maybe fifth thing on the list we should do” to reduce the emissions from air conditioning, says Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, a professor of climate change and energy policy at Central European University, and a lead author on the forthcoming IPCC report. Among the higher priorities that she mentions are planting trees, retrofitting old buildings with proper ventilation, and no longer building “concrete and glass cages that can’t withstand a heatwave”. She adds: “All of these things would be cheaper too, in the long run.” But while these things are technically cheaper, they require changes in behaviour and major policy shifts – and the open secret of the climate crisis is that nobody really knows how to make these kind of changes on the systematic, global scale that the severity of the crisis demands.If we are not about to be rescued by technology, and worldwide policy changes look like a distant hope, there remains a very simple way of reducing the environmental damage done by air conditioning: use less of it. But, as the ecological economist and IPCC author Julia Steinberger has written, any serious proposals to change our lifestyles – cutting down on driving, flying or imported avocados – are considered “beyond the pale, heretic, almost insane”. This is especially true of air conditioning, where calls to use it less are frequently treated as suggestions that people should die in heatwaves, or evidence of a malicious desire to deny other people the same comforts that citizens in wealthy countries already enjoy.This summer, the publication of a New York Times article asking “Do Americans need air conditioning?” touched off a thousand furious social media posts, uniting figures from the feminist writer and critic Roxane Gay (“You wouldn’t last a summer week in Florida without it. Get a grip”) to the conservative professor and pundit Tom Nichols (“Air conditioning is why we left the caves … You will get my AC from me when you pry it from my frozen, frosty hands”).Despite this backlash, there is a reasonable case to be made that we are over-reliant on air conditioning and could cut back. The supposedly ideal indoor temperature has long been determined by air-conditioning engineers, using criteria that suggest pretty much all humans want the same temperature range at all times. The underlying idea is that comfort is objective, and that a building in Jakarta should be the same temperature as one in Boston. In practice, says Leena Thomas, this means that the temperature in most air-conditioned buildings is usually “low-20s plusminus one”.But not everyone has accepted the notion that there is such as thing as the objectively “right” temperature. Studies have suggested that men have different ideal temperatures from women. In offices around the world, “Men toil in their dream temperatures, while women are left to shiver,” argued a 2015 article in the , one of many suggesting that the scientific research had simply confirmed something millions of women already knew.Researchers have also shown that people who live in hotter areas, even for a very short time, are comfortable at higher indoor temperatures. They contend that, whether it is a state of mind or a biological adjustment, human comfort is adaptive, not objective. This is something that seems obvious to many people who live with these temperatures. At a recent conference on air conditioning that I attended in London, an Indian delegate chided the crowd: “If I can work and function at 30C, you could too – believe you me.”Adding to the weight of evidence against the idea of the “ideal” temperature, Frederick Rohles, a psychologist and member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, has conducted studies showing that subjects who were shown a false thermometer displaying a high temperature felt warm, even if the room was cool. “These are the sorts of things that drive my engineering colleagues crazy,” he wrote in 2007. “Comfort is a state of mind!”Ashok Lall points out that once people are open to the idea that the temperature in a building can change, you can build houses that use air conditioning as a last resort, not a first step. “But there is no broad culture or regulation underpinning this,” he says. At the moment, it is the deterministic camp that has control of the levers of power – and their view continues to be reflected in building codes and standards around the world.How, then, can we get ourselves out of the air-conditioning trap? On the continuum of habits and technologies that we need to reduce or abandon if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, the air conditioner probably falls somewhere in the middle: harder to reduce than our habit of eating meat five times a week easier than eliminating the fossil-fuel automobile.According to Nick Mabey, a former senior civil servant who runs the UK-based climate politics consultancy E3G, air conditioning has – like many consumer products that are deeply embedded in society and, in aggregate, drive global warming – escaped the notice of most governments. There is little precedent for top-down regulation. “There is no department that handles this, there’s no guy you can just go talk to who controls air conditioning,” he says.The key, Mabey says, is to find the places it can be controlled, and begin the push there. He is supporting a UN programme that aims to improve the efficiency – and thus reduce the emissions – of all air conditioners sold worldwide. It falls under the unglamorous label of consumer standards. Currently, the average air conditioner on the market is about half as efficient as the best available unit. Closing that gap even a little bit would take a big chunk out of future emissions.In countries where air conditioning is still relatively new, an immense opportunity exists to find alternatives before it becomes a way of life. The aim, in the words of Thomas, should be to avoid “the worst of the west”. Recently, the Indian government adopted recommendations by Thomas, Rawal and others into its countrywide national residential building code (“an immensely powerful document” says Rawal). It allows higher indoor temperatures based on Indian field studies – Indian levels of comfort – and notes the “growing prevalence” of buildings that use air conditioning as a technology of last resort.Cutting down on air conditioning doesn’t mean leaving modernity behind, but it does require facing up to some of its consequences. “It’s not a matter of going back to the past. But before, people knew how to work with the climate,” says Ken Yeang. “Air conditioning became a way to control it, and it was no longer a concern. No one saw the consequences. People see them now.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

Gitanjali Rao’s film paints a luminous valentine to the city in all of its squalor and beauty and audaciously frames social-realist drama as a sentimental folk tale. The disparate ingredients do not always gel. But in fits and starts Bombay Rose casts quite a spell.I’m even tempted to regard the overstuffed plot as something of a necessity, given that the film is essentially about the crisscross of lives in a densely packed community, showing how this surging human traffic is really all connected and how the actions of one party have a domino effect on others. This introduces us to Kamala (voiced by Cyli Khare), who works as a dancer at an illegal nightclub while planning to sell herself into marriage in Dubai, before informing us that wait, she’s only doing this to provide for her younger sister Tara and her disabled grandfather, who works as a watchmaker but isn’t getting much trade. From here it ranges further afield, via child labourers on the run from the cops, to meet Salim (Amit Deondi), a Kashmiri youth orphaned by the military, who earns a crust selling the flowers he steals from graves. Salim, it turns out, is the one Kamala privately wants to marry.But this isn’t all the picture’s barely getting started. There’s also a cat that likes to wander the streets at night, watching the ghosts who dance inside the cemetery, and Mrs D’Souza (Amardeep Jha), an eccentric old actor who longs to be visited by a ghost of her own. If Bombay Rose doesn’t quite boast a cast of thousands, this can only be because Rao’s hand finally cramped up from drawing.Every now and then, Mrs D’Souza gives private lessons to Tara. When she’s not teaching the girl English, she’s schooling her in her colours, explaining the difference between red and crimson, purple and carmine. And this feels appropriate since Rao’s film appears captivated by colours, so drunk on its palette of turmeric oranges and primrose pinks that it eventually succumbs to a kind of Dutch courage and starts throwing in fantasy sequences involving flying horses and a talking bird. Bombay Rose works best when it keeps its feet on the ground, when it thrums to the sound of Mumbai street noise and keeps obscuring its characters with passing trucks and bicycles. The talking bird, on reflection, is a flight of fancy too far.Then again, Mrs D’Souza was once a Bollywood star, swooningly romantic in the high old style, and perhaps Rao’s animation takes its lead from that. Bombay Rose’s high-stakes melodrama might be ripped from the real world, but it has been powdered and perfumed – crammed full of archetypes and over-egged emotions, liberally sprinkled with musical interludes. Kamala wants Salim but she’s Hindu and he’s Muslim, which means their love can never be: “That only happens in fairytales,” scoffs the annoying talking bird. Except that maybe that’s the point maybe this is the quality that the film, despite its harsh realist trappings, has been aiming for all along. Life is a grind and the game is rigged and these citizens of Mumbai are barely getting by as it is. But that’s reckoning without a good fairy story’s knack of stepping in at the last moment to set everything wonderfully, magically straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e99230018fe1782844f1da1ed4c1f40c4629ff5/0_273_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95af1110a8d14f3e95ba5708c15b6bbd","title":"eat much less meat top vegan tips from worlds tastiest cuisines","story":"While veganism is growing rapidly in the west, other parts of the world have had meat-free cuisines for centuries. For a rich and varied plant-based diet, talk to the Chinese, Indians, Ethiopians … Like most revolutions, the current surge in meat-free eating takes much of its energy from its newness. This is a hip and sexy break with the past, a movement with Silicon Valley solutions to the historic restrictions of a meat-free diet.Consequently, we hear a lot about trashy vegan street food, plant-based wellness and futuristic “bleeding” burgers, but little from those nations where meat-light, vegetarian and vegan food has flourished for centuries. It is bizarre. Such cuisines offer huge inspiration for anyone keen to increase the creativity and flavour of their meat-free cooking. The chef Andrew Wong is baffled by western food manufacturers pouring money into developing mock meats. “Why waste your time R\u0026ampDing this stuff? It’s been done. Just go into Chinatown,” advises the chef-owner at London’s Michelin-starred A Wong.Since Buddhism’s arrival in China about 2,000 years ago, regularly abstaining from meat has been a feature of Chinese life. Wong says a meat-minimal approach to eating is now “ingrained”.“In every province and echelon of society, people understand food is medicine and eating too much meat is not good. In old recipes, there’s never a massive amount of protein. My grandmother would cook vegetable dishes and use a small amount of meat as a lubricating source of oil.”In the Forbidden City’s imperial court, that absence of meat spawned highly playful food theatre in which other ingredients were used to mimic meat. Today, Chinese chefs and food producers simulate meat and fish textures using vegetables, gluten and tofu in endless ingenious dishes and products. In these, mushrooms might pass for eel or offal, for instance, or gently cooked egg whites for crab meat.Despite being widely available in the UK’s Chinese supermarkets, many of the core ingredients in this cooking are little known outside Chinese kitchens. “When westerners think of tofu,” Wong says, “they think of one hard, claggy 80s product, not the variety and finesse in 50 types of tofu all specific to inidual dishes. Now you can get tofu as smooth as creme brulee. Bean curd skin, a tofu by-product, is versatile, too. You can fry and crisp it, steam things in it to give them a skin-like texture or cook it over fire, to create this crunchy, cheesy, stringy thing.”All this mimicry is underpinned by numerous fermented ingredients that build umami flavours into dishes: “Bean curd or chilli bean paste, dried black beans, preserved dried vegetables – these all add layers of savouriness that fool your brain into thinking there must be meat there.”Some Ethiopian staples, such as injera, a tangy, pancake-like bread made from fermented batter, can take years to master. “Sometimes, even I don’t get what I really want,” laughs Melaku, who uses wheat flour, not the traditional teff, in her injera. Export, she believes, is exacerbating the soaring cost of teff back home, so she adapted: “Why do I need to bring teff from my people, taking what they can’t even afford? I can’t do it.”However, from breakfast beso, a pan-toasted barley flour porridge, to tikil gomen, a cabbage and fried potato dish seasoned with whole jalapeño, there are easier ways into Ethiopian cooking. On fasting days, families often enjoy beyaynetu, inidual vegetarian platters where dishes such as fasolia (green beans in tomato sauce), gomen (simmered greens), shiro (a highly seasoned chickpea flour paste similar in texture to pease pudding) and thick, spicy wat stews are all served on an injera flatbread.From misir (red lentil) to atakilt (cabbage, potato and carrot), wat stews of just a few ingredients, perfumed with hot berbere spice mix, are central to Ethiopian cooking. Find a high-quality berbere and take time with the wat’s onion base. The onions must be finely chopped and gently sweated until utterly broken down, which can take over an hour. “We do everything by the book and by hand,” says Melaku.Mayur Patel, co-owner of the northern Bundobust restaurants, insists the Gujarati food he grew up on is “simpler than it’s made out. All the ingredients are available in Asian supermarkets everywhere and we don’t use dozens of spices. It’s more about how you combine and cook them – say, adding the garam masala at the beginning or end, which creates completely different flavours.”You do not need to understand the Ayurvedic roots of meat-free Hindu cooking (certain “hot” foods are thought to dangerously excite the senses, yet fresh green chillies are somehow “calming”) to get to grips with Patel’s beloved dhal baht, “like Indian gravy that you add to rice”, or bataka shak, a dry-fried potato curry. Instead, you need to stock up on seasonings (mustard seed, fenugreek, coriander powder, cumin, asafoetida and curry leaves), buy a pressure cooker to speed up all those lentils you will be cooking and, importantly, perfect your tempering to either start a curry or finish one with a flourish.“Starting by tempering oil with fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds and ground onion is fundamental. That gives you that savoury, jammy, umami flavour, like Marmite. Then, as you add fresh ingredients – green beans, aubergines, potato – you get different textures coming out. Okra, for instance, really thickens the base. It’s like making a cocktail, combining and blending vegetables. I think that gives you more creative space than basing a dish on one simple protein.”It is a learning process. But you have Google and a head start, in that most Britons are familiar with the flavours of Indian food, if not the vast hinterland of Indian regional or even Gujarati cooking. Patel, for instance, is obsessed by his mum’s khandvi, pillowy pasta-like rolls made with gram flour and yoghurt.Salvo’s serves 19 vegetarian dishes and 10 meat-free sides. The Leeds Italian has a dedicated vegan menu, too. The co-owner Gip Dammone relays these stats to demonstrate how, as the son of southern Italians – mum from Campania, dad from Sicily – he has a love of high-quality seasonal vegetables and vegetable dishes in his DNA.The Dammone family lived in Salerno in the 70s: “We were almost naturally vegetarian without knowing. Meat was an expensive commodity, utilised sparingly. Mum would send me to the butcher’s, but I never ordered more than 100g of meat. A meat ragu wasn’t a load of mince you’d be excited to find a scrap of meat in there. We’d have mainly bread meatballs or often ‘meatballs’ made with diced, fried aubergine.”In the poorer Italian south, families had learned to cook without (much) meat and, making a virtue of a necessity, use every last scrap of the beautiful produce growing in the rich volcanic soils of Puglia and Campania. Turnip tops went into pasta with capers and anchovies bitter lettuces were stewed with garlic, oil and water “ amazing” quarter-inch-thick slices of aubergine (known as la carne del popolo, the meat of the masses), were dipped in egg, floured and fried, years before the cauliflower steak. On the courgette-mad Cilento coast, you would see sliced courgettes drying on balconies, so when they were fried, they browned quickly: “They know how to process veg in southern Italy.”Understandably, Dammone is mystified by meat substitutes such as seitan: “It’s like boiling dough. There’s a better mouthful in a lot of veg.” This is something he is reminded of every time he visits Italy, where “vegetables are still revered in their own right”. Could demanding far better vegetables be the key to unlocking Britain’s meat-free future?Jamaica: Ital, a belief system focused on increasing “livity” or life-energy, whose purest adherents eat only organic, vegan food, developed alongside Rastafarianism in 30s Jamaica. Check out the bean and pumpkin curries and stews at Negril in Brixton, south London, or Liverpool’s street-food outfit Ital Fresh. Think jerk-marinated cauliflower wings.Vietnam: In Vietnam, Mahayana Buddhist dietary rules gave rise to dedicated meat-free dishes and veggie versions of everyday staples, such as banh mi sandwiches and noodle bowls. For his much-praised book Vegetarian Việt Nam (£25, WW Norton), Cameron Stauch spoke to monks and home cooks to get the skinny on daily dishes and specials, such as the Twelve Predestined Affinities Salad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d983d7d5c47e774238f07d7dcbc66f8b1c3cb1/0_96_2029_1217/master/2029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad1031fa91d389d1b2fe67cc93b85255","title":"england squad gareth southgate tyrone mings euro 2020 qualifiers","story":"Gareth Southgate has called up the defenders Aaron Wan-Bissaka of Manchester United and Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Kosovo, with Liverpool’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also included after injury.With Kieran Trippier back in the fold having moved to Atlético Madrid, there is no place in the squad for Manchester City’s Kyle Walker, but Leicester’s James Maddison and Chelsea’s Mason Mount have been selected.Southgate said Walker had not been dropped and that he was looking at younger right-backs.

Ineligible to play for her club until her 16th birthday on 4 September, Wales’s newest senior call-up, Carrie Jones, could make her international debut before she can turn out for Cardiff City.It may be fair to assume Jones is unlikely to start the Euro 2021 qualifiers against the Faroe Islands on Thursday night and Northern Ireland on Tuesday but she could feature, with the manager, Jayne Ludlow, saying: “I see her challenging for a place. If she wasn’t going to do that she wouldn’t be selected.“The reality of the youngster we’re talking about is that she’s performing very well in the domestic programme and we have high hopes for her in the future. It’s very early days in her senior career, club and country, and it’s a learning process.”So where has Jones come from? While playing for Newtown White Stars and Berriew Juniors in Powys, before joining the Women’s National Southern Premier League side Cardiff this summer, she has been nurtured by the Wales performance squad too. And with Ludlow and her coaching team stretched across all international age groups, they have a good grip on players coming through.“Luckily there is another girl that we share lifts with so it’s not as hard, but obviously ‘Thanks Mum!’” she says with a grin at her mother seated in the corner.“It’s twice a week, Tuesday and Friday, with a game on Sunday which could be anywhere. Last week I went somewhere in London, so obviously it’s hard on Mum and Dad, and I’ve got a brother and sister so it’s hard for them to give time to them because of my football. It’s a huge commitment. As well as that it’s a three- or four-hour session so I don’t get back until 12, then have to wake up at 7am in the morning to catch the bus.”It is a familiar scenario faced by many a parent of a talented young female player. With high-level training hard to come by, long journeys are part and parcel of nurturing talented daughters.“I started playing at seven,” says Jones. “I’ve got older male cousins and they’re big football fans. We used to go over my nan’s farm and start playing football in the fields, and we’d set up little five-a-sides with the family on a Sunday, and then it’s just progressed from there.Now, she has swapped cousins for players such as Manchester United’s Hayley Ladd, Reading’s Natasha Harding and, when fit, the midfield magician Jess Fishlock. “It’s crazy, you know?” Jones says. “Cos I was in the changing rooms for the Russia game and being in the squad has been a dream of mine since I was seven years old, so having Jess Fishlock sitting opposite me in the changing room, I was like: ‘Woooah.’”Despite being unable to start the season with Cardiff, Jones has played a few pre-season games. “I’ve been training with the girls, so that’s not that much of a change, but with the games it’s so much different in terms of physicality,” she says.Once this window is over she heads back to school. The reception from her classmates may be a little bit different. “The BBC are showing the games, so hopefully they will find out,” she says. “I don’t actually know when I’ll go back to school because I’ve got my first Cardiff game on the second day that I’ll go back and I’ll miss the first day of school because I’m on camp. Hopefully I’ll get a warm welcome, though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3805b2dece2a9d0aa9477da9ff94ba78b4f0cce2/0_106_4283_2570/master/4283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=450d7996c5196ea6376d8bcc8eb00685","title":"us greta thunberg climate","story":"Even in such a ided and troubled country, there is hope. Between us we can beat the climate destroyersThank you for travelling across the Atlantic to north America to help us do the most important work in the world. There are those of us who welcome you and those who do not because you have landed in two places, a place being born and a place dying, noisily, violently, with as much damage as possible.It has always been two places, since the earliest Europeans arrived in places where Native people already lived, and pretended they were new and gave them the wrong names. You can tell the history of the United States – which are not very united now – as the history of Sojourner Truth, the heroine who helped liberate the enslaved, as that of the slaveowners and defenders of slavery, as a place of visionary environmental voices such as Rachel Carson and the corporate powers and profiteers she fought and exposed.Right now the US is the country of Donald Trump and of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of climate destroyers and climate protectors. Sometimes the Truths and the Carsons have won. I believe it is more than possible for Ocasio-Cortez and the Green New Deal to win, for the spirit of generosity and inclusion and the protection of nature to win – but that depends on what we do now. Which is why I’m so grateful that you have arrived to galvanize us with your clarity of vision and passionate commitment.Not long ago I talked to a powerful climate organizer who began her work when she was only a little older than you, and she told me that her hope right now is that people recognize that this is a moment of great possibility, of openings and momentum, and a growing alarm and commitment to what the changing climate requires of us. Something has changed, thanks to you and to the young people who have brought new urgency and vision to the climate movement. Many people have become concerned and awake for the first time, and the conversation we need to have is opening up. People are ready for change, or some of us are. This is what’s being born in the US and around the world: not only new energy systems, but new social systems with more room for the voices of those who are not white or male or straight or neurotypical.The old energy system was about centralized control and the malevolent power of Gazprom and BP, Shell and Chevron, and the governments warped into serving them rather than humanity. The new system must not only be about localized energy, but democratized decision-making, about the rights of nature and the rights of the vulnerable and the future, over profit.Some of this is already here: not only the larger groups you’re surely heard of – the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, the Sierra Club, Rainforest Action Network – but countless local and tribal groups that have arisen to stop this pipeline or that coal port or these fracking projects, to protect this forest or this mountain or these waters. They are not visible the way the United Nations or the US Congress or European Union is, but their work matters, and perhaps we will build a lot of this transition out from below – but we need the big policy agendas set from above as well.Everywhere I see remarkable things happening. No matter how much you see of this big country, this huge continent, there is more than you can see. I hope you have a chance to see some of the beauty of the American landscapes, from rainforests to deserts there is also beauty in the passionate commitment around the country. Coalminers in Kentucky have been blocking a coal train track for a month, because their bankrupt company stiffed them on wages, and coalminers elsewhere recently spoke to this newspaper about their clarity that coal is over and that the Green New Deal and its jobs are welcome. The gigantic coal-burning, sky-polluting Navajo Generating Station in Arizona will shut down later this year, and, Scientific American reported, “Its average annual emissions over that period are roughly equivalent to what 3.3 million passenger cars would pump into the atmosphere in a single year. The Navajo Generating Station isn’t alone. It’s among a new wave of super-polluters headed for the scrap heap,” including giant plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.” Last year, US coal plants with annual emissions of 83 million tonnes of carbon were shut down.Worldwide, we are in the midst of an energy revolution that dwarfs the industrial revolution: human beings will for the first time not use fire, will not release carbon into the sky, to get most of our energy. We will inevitably transition away from fossil fuels as a primary energy source, and the question is only when. If we do it swiftly, we minimize damage to the climate if we wait, we maximize it. The damage is here, and it’s not only destroying nature, it’s killing us. When the California town of Paradise burned down last November, at least 86 people burned to death or choked on smoke millions suffered from the smoke that spread across the region. Heat deaths are up in the south-west, where 235 people died in Arizona alone from this cause during 2017.But we also know that there are so many uncounted deaths from poisonous fossil fuels. We know that many of the refugees on the USA’s southern border are climate refugees, driven out of their homes in Central America by the failure of agriculture from unpredictable and violent weather, heat, and drought. We know that Alaska was this month for the first time ice-free all along its coast, and the hot dry weather inland led to horrific wildfires. “Starting on the fourth of July and lasting multiple days, temperatures across Alaska were 20 to 30 degrees above average in some locations,” reported National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.To be a climate activist anywhere on Earth now is to stand at a crossroads: heaven on one side and hell on the other. Heaven because the transition we need to make and are making – just not big enough or fast enough – is not only an power-generation revolution, but a decentralization of political power, a shift away from the big energy companies who used governments to make wars and make profits for them, a shift away from the poisonousness of fossil fuel. Hell because the destruction of what it took nature millions of years to create – the exquisite balance of ecosystems, of bird migration in harmony with seasons, of symbioses between species, of the great Himalayan and Andean glaciers whose waters feed so many people, of rainforests and temperate forests – is hideous as well as terrifying. The Amazon is burning because of one rightwing leader and a system that rewards agricultural products but not forest protection, even though we need rainforests more than we need the soybeans and beef raised on the land stolen from the rainforest and its indigenous inhabitants.I’ve mentioned a bit of what is going on in my troubled, complicated country, the US, but of course these are global conflicts and global situations, and the solutions are advancing almost everywhere, because they are good solutions to terrible problems.You have come to help us choose the former over the latter, and more of us thank you than you will ever be able to see or hear. More than that, we’re with you, trying to realize the goals that the climate demands of us, to make a sustainable world for those who are young now, those yet to come, and for the beauty of the world that is still with us.• Rebecca Solnit is a journalist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c6eaccff63e6f69096ce94cb355b8572825eb1/2_0_6137_3684/master/6137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b64848ac1ab7f6f0ddfb17eddefb91c","title":"complete guide getting life back on track autumn food finances","story":"From heat to holidays, the summer can bring all sorts of disruption to your regular schedule. Here experts explain how to improve everything from food to financesNotebooks that smell of fresh paper, purchased in the stationery shop. Uniform laid out neatly on a chair a rucksack packed, checked and rechecked. No matter how old you get, the memory of the start of the school year never leaves you. The butterfly nerves of a new teacher and classroom an exhilarating jump that quickly becomes routine.But what if we adults used September as the opportunity for a reset? Because, after the excesses of the summer – sugary cocktails knocked back by a pool and gut-busting barbecue plates loaded up night after night – September can be a time for a much-needed refresh. We asked experts for their advice on how to get your year back on track, whatever your age.New year fitness resolutions are as predictable as the tides: they come and go, but rarely stick. Instead of waiting until January to purchase a gym membership that will go unused come March, set good behaviour patterns now, while the weather is better and daylight are hours longer.“Book the time out in your diary, and treat it like a work meeting that can’t be missed,” says Sarah Overall, a personal trainer. Although it is tempting to go full throttle, a measured approach is better. “Don’t try to binge on exercise and do five sessions in your first week,” Overall says. “Be sensible. Put in two sessions for your first week back, with a few days break in between.” Aim to build up to four workouts a week.Even if you haven’t spent the summer months gorging yourself, September is a good time to refocus your eating habits, away from the diet culture messaging that is so pervasive in the new year. “Get stuck into normality – whatever that is for you,” advises Priya Tew, a dietitian . “Find a good routine for yourself – so three meals a day that are a balanced mixture of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, proteins and healthy fats.”If you feel you have overindulged on holiday, don’t go on a fad diet. “They don’t work,” says Tew. “They just lead to people falling off the wagon and feeling rubbish about themselves. Rather than falling into that trap of yo-yo dieting, make smaller, sustainable changes.” This might mean increasing your fruit and vegetables by one portion a day, or reaching for healthy snacks such as carrots and hummus instead of the biscuit tin.It is a good idea to set aside some time each week to meal plan, and bulk cooking can help a new routine to stick. “That way, you’re not standing in the kitchen figuring out what to eat,” says Tew. If you are trying to save money from your weekly shop, frozen and tinned food are your friends. “They can be a lot cheaper and provide you with really good nutrition for your body,” she says. Add in a tin of lentils where you would usually use meat for a healthy and cost-saving measure.Whereas the summer often means staying up late or tossing and turning in the sweltering heat, autumn is the ideal time to get sleep back on track. If you are concerned you’re not hitting that magic eight-hour target, remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. “Sleep needs are inidual,” says Dr Ari Manuel, a sleep and ventilation consultant at Aintree University NHS trust. Most people will need seven to nine hours a night, but each person’s needs vary. If you wake up feeling exhausted or are often tired during the day, you may be sleep deprived.This can be remedied through good sleep hygiene. “It is about understanding the rhythms of your own sleep and your circadian rhythms,” Manuel says. “When you have signals from your body that it is tired, you should respect them and not push through. Recognise that the night is for relaxation, restoration and sleep.”Go to bed at the same time on weekends and weekdays. “Wind down from technology before sleep, don’t eat too much heavy food or exercise late at night, and have a cool, dark and quiet bedroom,” Manuel says. Your bedroom should be a place for rest and sex and nothing else. Make sure to disconnect from the outside world in the hour before bed. “It is about accepting that this is a time for you to relax and go to sleep – this is your time and no one else’s.” Which means no aimless social media scrolling in bed.There is growing concern about the impact of blue light from screens before bedtime, but Manuel says this misses the point: all light, even from the streetlight outside your window, can disrupt sleep. It might help to invest in a blackout blind or an eye mask.If you’re feeling the pinch after the summer break, now is a good time to think about your financial health, says Jason Butler, a personal finance expert and author of Money Moments: Simple Steps to Financial Well-being.Consider your spending. “One of the reasons people don’t get ahead financially is because they’ve never really addressed their relationship with money,” says Butler. Do you equate spending with feeling good about yourself? Or are you a “passive spender” who never bothers to check the prices of things?Set aside half a day to take stock: could you switch your utility bills to a cheaper provider? Do you really need that pricey phone contract? It may seem tedious, but when you think about the potential savings, it is well worth it. “You might save yourself £500 a year – how many people earn that much in half a day?”Say no to expensive social events that aren’t important to you. Turn off one-step purchasing online to curb impulse buys. “It’s not about becoming a monk and locking yourself away,” Butler says, “but you need to be clear about what you can afford.”And if you are not able to save any money, consider how you can increase your earnings. “If you don’t warrant a pay rise,” says Butler, “think about what you can do: do you need more training? Are there other steps you can take to become more valuable to your employer? Or do you need to retrain and get a new, better-paid job?”It is common to not want to rush back to the office after a summer break. But if the thought of returning to work fills you with panic, it may be time for a professional shakeup. The first step is to look at how you can improve your role, because it is easier to stay in a job than to look for new opportunities.“The ‘stop, start, continue’ method is really helpful,” says Zena Everett, an executive coach and career expert. “Think: what is it that I do that isn’t helping my career? What do I need to stop doing?” This might be as simple as eating lunch at your desk or not speaking up in meetings. Then identify what you need to start doing: develop new skills? Move departments? Get a promotion? Finally, think about how you can continue moving your career forward – which often means networking. “That doesn’t mean going to complicated networking events,” Everett says. “It just means keeping in touch with previous colleagues, grabbing cups of coffee with people and talking to people in different departments.”If you are certain you want to move jobs, work out where you add value. “There is no point in going into the jobs market and telling people what you don’t want to do,” says Everett. “That is not compelling. Think about what you’ve delivered and what your skillset is.” A good way to know your strengths is to think about what doesn’t get done when you’re out of the office – what do your colleagues wait for you to come back to do?If you are feeling very down about work, Everett suggests considering whether there may be other factors afoot. It is easy to attach all of life’s ills to a testy boss or punishing workload – but your job may not be the only thing making you miserable. “Is it a work thing, or something else? If you felt happy and motivated when you were on holiday, it’s probably work related. But if you were on holiday and still felt unhappy and unmotivated, it’s possibly a bigger issue – and changing jobs may not be the answer to everything.”“Periods of relaxation tend to bring up all sorts of thoughts about your relationships,” says Gurpreet Singh, a Relate counsellor. “People go on holiday and relax. When they come back, it’s a good idea to re-energise and think about what they want from their relationships.”Relationships should be viewed as something you need to work at – a piano that needs tuning – rather than something you can expect to take care of itself. “We’re often guilty of taking our romantic relationships for granted,” Singh says. “It’s easy to fall into a pattern – once the honeymoon period is over – of forgetting to spend time together. It’s a good idea to pause and say: ‘Where are we?’”Singh advises having such a conversation at a time when you’re both relaxed and not during an argument. If you are unhappy, explain what you would like to see change in the relationship, but don’t expect miracles overnight – they take time. “Be honest about what you’re unhappy about, and have the courage to engage in the idea of change,” says Singh. “A lot of people may be unhappy but they go on living the way they are, and think that things will get better on their own – but they don’t.” It needn’t take a dramatic change to get a relationship back on track – simple things such as improving how you communicate with each other or making time for a regular date night can be just as effective.It is not just romantic relationships that may need a reset. If you’re feeling lonely, resist the urge to try to make new friends and “invest in building the relationships you already have”, Singh suggests. “Family relationships can be improved with the right help and investment of time and effort,” he says. “But both people have to want to improve the relationship – you can’t do it alone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69b5f5321dc063cf70af148afc329281f0b9cf86/0_175_5156_3093/master/5156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd92bf6a8ad461938d35862ae8a51a93","title":"men women workplace study harassment harvard metoo","story":"A new study has found US men appear to be following Mike Pence’s lead. Maybe they’re angry that #MeToo ever happenedIt looks like Mike Pence is quite the trendsetter. The US vice-president famously refuses to have dinner alone with any woman who isn’t his wife – and now working men across corporate America appear to be following his lead.A new study, due to be published in the journal Organizational Dynamics, has found that, following the #MeToo movement, men are significantly more reluctant to interact with their female colleagues. A few highlights from the research include:There’s been a lot of talk about “grey areas” in #MeToo. All this harassment business is very difficult for men, we’re told, because nobody even knows what sexual harassment is any more! Men are afraid to even shake a woman’s hand in case she thinks it’s harassment! Easier to just avoid contact altogether! What’s really interesting about this study, however, is that it thoroughly debunks the argument that men are confused about what constitutes unacceptable behavior. The very first thing researchers did was look at 19 behaviours (emailing sexual jokes to a subordinate, for example) and get people to classify it as harassment or not. Surprise, surprise, both genders basically agreed on what harassment entails.“Most men know what sexual harassment is, and most women know what it is,” Leanne Atwater, a professor at the University of Houston and one of the study’s authors, told the Harvard Business Review. “The idea that men don’t know their behavior is bad and that women are making a mountain out of a molehill is largely untrue. If anything, women are more lenient in defining harassment.”So there you go: most men are perfectly aware of the difference between a friendly hug and a creepy hug. They are perfectly aware of what constitutes harassment and what doesn’t. Which makes you wonder why so many men are afraid to interact with women at work?The answer to that question, perhaps, is that a lot of men aren’t so much afraid of being accused of anything as they are they are angry that #MeToo ever happened. They’re angry that they’ve been made to think about their behavior, made to interrogate power dynamics they always took for granted, and they are punishing women for it by refusing to interact with them.It’s worth noting, I think, that the Harvard Business Review article previewing the study’s 2019 results is headlined The #MeToo Backlash. You see that phrase a lot and that framing subtly implies that #MeToo went too far, that a backlash is only natural. It’s yet another form of victim-blaming another way to quietly put women back in their place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd8a9e86ddb1c18ba63c2d9624b45215ce924ea/0_22_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c42cc0abd2935671209331dc315ae69","title":"oliver most popular boys name in england and wales for sixth year","story":"Oliver and Olivia remain favourite names for boys and girls in England and WalesArthur has entered the top 10 boys’ names for the first time in almost a century, with the television gangster series Peaky Blinders believed to be the inspiration for some of the most popular baby names.While Arthur was the only new entry in the top 10 names for boys in 2018, replacing Jacob, Sophia and Grace replaced Poppy and Lily among the top 10 names for girls, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.“Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2018, although there are the first signs that Oliver’s six-year reign as the number one name for boys is under threat,” Nick Stripe, the head of life events at the ONS, said.“Arthur surged into the top 10 boys’ names for the first time since the 1920s, and Ada jumped into the girls’ top 100 for the first time in a century too, both perhaps inspired by characters in the BBC TV drama Peaky Blinders.”The names Ada and Arthur, popular in the early 1900s, appear to be undergoing a renaissance, with Peaky Blinders, which is currently airing its fifth series, featuring characters with those names.Ada climbed 49 places to become the 65th most popular name for girls in 2018 – the second largest rise within the top 100 names. Arthur has been rising within the top 100 names for boys since 2009 and was the seventh most popular name for boys last year.Despite ranking in 255th place, the name Cillian – Peaky Blinders’ lead character, Thomas Shelby, is played by the actor Cillian Murphy – has also been steadily growing in popularity, rising 295 places in the last five years.Olivia was the most popular name for girls in England and Wales, while Oliver was outranked by Muhammad in four of the nine English regions, and by Harry in north-east England.Grayson, Rowan and Tobias entered the top 100 names for boys in 2018 for the first time, while the girls’ names Delilah, Ayla and Margot – which rose fastest of all the most popular names – also made their first appearance among the 62,729 different names given to 657,076 newborns last year.Stripe added: “On the flipside, the growth in the use of technology assistants in our homes may help to explain why the number of baby girls named Alexa has more than halved compared with 2017. Communicating with young children can be hard enough at the best of times.”For the first time, the ONS also analysed how names vary depending on the age of the baby’s mother. Those aged 35 years and above tended to prefer more traditional names, compared with mothers under 25 who were more likely to choose non-traditional, shortened or hyphenated names.Archie, the name of Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex’s child, was the fourth most popular name for mothers under 25, far more popular than for mothers over 35.Hunter, the 44th most popular boys’ name in 2018, rose 34 places on the previous year. Amelia continued to be the second most common name for baby girls while Ava rose from fourth place in 2017 to third in 2018, swapping places with Isla."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8608e8aea9ea4bfb54bb7723d072738b67c608/45_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977f63cf1205c6bd03e6ca062f9d2821","title":"use it or lose it just hours left to put in ppi compensation claim","story":"FCA urges British consumers to submit their complaints by 11.59pm deadline on ThursdayUK consumers have just hours left to submit a complaint about payment protection insurance (PPI) before they lose their chance to claim compensation.The deadline is 11.59pm on Thursday 29 August, and the Financial Conduct Authority is urging people to act now.“This is the final chance for consumers to think about whether they had PPI and submit a complaint directly to any providers right away … There’s still time to act if you do it now,” said the regulator.Many of the biggest claims management companies have already stopped accepting PPI claims because, they said, there was a risk they would not be able to register them with the lenders before the deadline.PPI is Britain’s costliest ever consumer scandal, with £36bn paid out by UK banks to compensate people who bought often-worthless insurance cover, thinking it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment. Of the total, £340m was paid out in June alone.As many as 64m PPI policies were sold in the UK, but very often the cover was mis-sold. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, mortgages, credit cards and other deals.The FCA has been running a campaign to raise awareness of the deadline, leading to a more than fivefold increase in its website users and a near eightfold increase in calls compared with the previous nine weeks.

We rank her 22 singles, from her 1997 debut to 2017’s I’m BetterA ballad from the album Miss E … So Addictive, enlivened by its off-kilter rhythm and queasy-sounding sample, retooled as a tribute to Elliott’s late friend and collaborator Aaliyah. While the lyrics sort of fit their new purpose, the accompanying video bizarrely concludes with a version of party anthem 4 My People, apparently intended as Elliott’s comment on 911.A relative flop after a string of hits, perhaps because it abandoned the frenetic futurism of her most famous singles in favour of straight-up retro R\u0026ampB. Teary Eyed offered further proof that Elliott could really sing and packed a decent chorus without causing the seismic thrills of Lose Control or Work It.I’m Better arrived 20 years after Elliott’s debut single – an eternity in hip-hop – and found her paying lip service to current trends: a trap-influenced beat, a hint of slurred vowels about her delivery, lyrical references to “the bando”. Less innovative than her biggest hits, it is still home to some sharp lines: “Missy talk big I’m so grande … I just rant like I’m Kanye.”A heartbroken R\u0026ampB slow jam – featuring dimly remembered trio 702, for whom a pre-fame Elliott wrote songs – rendered into something alien-sounding: the rhythm stammers and never settles the instruments sound slightly off-key and Elliott’s voice floats ethereally over the top, lending its saga of a collapsing relationship a blank-eyed, disaffected air.A paean to hip-hop’s belated discovery of MDMA – “I wanna dance and lick your face,” offers Elliott, while guest vocalist Eve bemoans the ecstasy user’s perennial bugbear, drunks spoiling the vibe – 4 My People’s four-to-the-floor house beat has an authentically sweaty, wild-eyed quality, vastly superior to hip-hop’s subsequent dabblings in shiny pop-house.There is a boldness to Sock It 2 Me – which is based on a sample from the Delfonics’ Ready Or Not Here I Come, a song the world should have had its fill of following the Fugees’ chart-topping cover the previous year. But producer Timbaland warps the sample into a strange, disjointed new shape Missy sings and Da Brat offers a warp-speed guest appearance.Missy back in warped R\u0026ampB mode – a smart, witty take on the standard no-romance-without-finance lyric (“Talk is talk and talk is cheap  Tell it to her, don’t say it to me”), further brightened by the appearance of Outkast’s Big Boi, who goes from rapping about lingerie to issuing threats in archaic English (“I will jab thee and stab thee”).The brilliance of Missy Elliott’s exploration of the topic of premature ejaculation (spoiler: she is not terribly sympathetic) lies in the weirdness of its structure, at least in the version from the video. A minute before the end, it turns into a completely new track, dropping the G-funk synths for a propulsive, percussive, dancehall-influenced finale that is inexplicable and inspired.Subtle but sexy, the final single from Missy Elliott’s debut album is best heard in the remix used on its supernatural-themed video and the soundtrack to teen comedy Can’t Hardly Wait, where the low-riding funk of the rhythm track is disrupted by samples of neighing horses and eventually replaced by strings sourced from Björk’s Joga.Unfairly ignored, Elliott’s second single from the soundtrack of Step Up 2: The Streets was great: a clattering beat that nodded towards the kind of block-party breaks that inspired hip-hop in the first place, Missy hymning the potent effect of her “big old donkey” on any passing men.Haters beware: Elliott is in particularly raw-throated, bug-eyed form in a post-cameraphone but pre-social-media assault on privacy invasion and rumour-mongering that addressed questions about her sexuality. A Fatboy Slim remix highlighted the ultra-hooky chorus, but the best line might be one of Missy’s most inventive disses: “You soggy breasts, cow stomachs.”Missy Elliott was a groundbreaker, sonically and lyrically, turning hip-hop’s standard narrative of sexual power and limited notion of feminine beauty on its head. She does it here: paying tribute to her own gorgeousness on the dancefloor, before sending the guy she takes home packing: “You gets nowhere, just two blue balls down in your underwear.”For all its forward-thinking, Elliott’s sound frequently paid homage to hip-hop’s roots. Never more so than here: We Run This is a thrilling reworking of Michael Viner’s Incredible Bongo Band’s b-boy anthem Apache, tricked out with a blaring horn section, filled with call-and-response vocals that sounds like a guaranteed party-starter.The saga of Missy Elliott’s still-unreleased seventh album – endlessly delayed by ill-health and artistic indecision – begins here, 11 years ago. A head-turning cacophony of airhorns, electronic noise and dub-influenced effects complete with a return to Work It’s backwards-masked vocals, it is hard not to think it would have been a hit six years earlier.Despite a $2m video, the first single from Elliott’s second album, Da Real World, was a relative flop, which may have had less to do with its quality than the sonic risks Elliott and Timbaland were taking. She’s a Bitch is stripped back to almost nothing, a two-note riff that repeats throughout, never changing, and some abstract electronic strings: it is all it needs.The best single from Da Real World. Everyone who appears on the hit remix version – Nas, Q-Tip, Eve – turns in a stellar performance, but the real star is the song itself: Elliott’s breathy, consumed-by-lust vocal chafing against the lyrics’ hard-eyed monetary concerns the backing, with its low-key but addictive steel pan sample and willingness to let the beat drop away into silence.After a sporadic series of promotional releases that failed to attract much attention, WTF was a million-seller. You can see why. Pharrell Williams’ beat recalls the Neptunes’ early 00s imperial phase, while Elliott sounds imperious as she ponders cultural appropriation and offers fair warning to young pretenders: “Blah-blah-blah, you best go rewrite your bars.”By now, Elliott and Timbaland were adept at the alchemical business of making hugely exciting hit singles out of deeply unlikely ingredients. Lose Control variously features 80s electro-inspired synths and a drum machine, Ciara sweetly cooing an old-fashioned R\u0026ampB hook and Fatman Scoop shouting his head off. Shouldn’t work works perfectly.It is worth considering the hip-hop era in which The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly) appeared. It was the year of Puff Daddy’s I’ll Be Missing You, Will Smith’s Big Willie Style and Jay-Z’s pop-facing In My Lifetime: not the ideal moment for a female rapper clad in a bin liner to release a weird, sparse debut single. Its Ann Peebles sample provided a hook, but more important was how boldly it announced a stereotype-smashing, unique talent.Amid the sonic pyrotechnics of her greatest singles, it is easy to overlook what a fantastic rapper Missy Elliott can be. The brilliant Pass That Dutch is primary evidence – a sinister, sparse backing track with a Technicolor vocal performance: at turns insouciant, commanding, intense and very funny, complete with a faux acceptance speech.Influenced by old school hip-hop – it samples Run DMC and Rock Master Scott \u0026amp the Dynamic Three alongside Blondie’s Heart of Glass – but with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, Work It’s mélange of backward vocals, elephant samples and lyrics that would later have been labelled “body positive” is totally fantastic: joyous and ahead of its time.It is a close-run thing, but Get Ur Freak On just shades it as Missy Elliott’s greatest single. A spare, supremely confident Top 10 masterclass in being simultaneously audacious and commercial, its relentless six-note sample – bhangra with a hint of drum’n’bass – keeps dropping out, leaving blank space in which Elliott can roar, whisper and shush her detractors. Horror-movie-soundtrack electronics hover ominously in the background, while voices speaking in Hindi and Japanese weave in and out of the mix. And Elliott is on fire: there is something about the don’t-even-try message to her competitors that feels bound up with the way Get Ur Freak On sounds: an artist who knows she has made a strange, groundbreaking, utterly compelling masterpiece.Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The best Stephen King movies\u0026nbsp - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Missy Elliott\u0027s solo singles – ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Joni Mitchell\u0027s albums – ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/330e57c3df3eaf894e34bdbef0f5be00d64b2a71/0_92_1535_921/master/1535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52a45e62d6e5413529a2ea63e0691718","title":"prom 52 britten sinfoniawigglesworth review connecting the dots from mozart to modernity","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonIn a bill of works by great composers, influenced by other great composers, Wigglesworth’s intricate, beautifully coloured Piano Concerto held its own The composer had provided his own programme note on the new concerto, and his rather dry, factual description did the piece no favours. It’s a much more attractive, vividly inventive piece than he implied, perhaps his most effective orchestral score to date. The neoclassical-sounding movement titles – Arioso, Scherzo, Notturno and Gigue – belie music that is constantly changing mood and direction, and engages the solo piano in intricate, beautifully coloured dialogues with the orchestra, with the gracefully scored nocturne at its heart. Wigglesworth’s claim that the solo piano writing is “neither bravura, nor particularly virtuosic” needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, too, though Marc-André Hamelin typically made light of all the challenges it presents.The premiere was followed by the Divertimento from The Fairy’s Kiss, the concert suite that Stravinsky drew from his 1928 ballet score. It’s based on music by Tchaikovsky, but the assimilation is so seamless it’s often hard to tell where the Tchaikovsky ends and the Stravinsky begins, and Wigglesworth and the Britten Sinfonia balanced its rhythmic punch with luscious string lines and deft woodwind solos.That certainly finished the concert on an upbeat note, but the first half had been less convincing. Mozart’s Concerto for two piano K365, with Hamelin and Wigglesworth (directing from the keyboard) as the soloists, had made a rather uncertain opening, not helped by the fuzziness that the Albert Hall acoustic regularly endowed on the piano lines, while Tchaikovsky’s Mozartiana, his fourth orchestral suite, didn’t really justify the musical logic of including it in the business of one composer appropriating the music of another, at least, Stravinsky significantly outdid his great Russian predecessor.• Available on BBC Sounds.

And if Corbyn, or anybody else, is unable to form an administration that can command a majority of MPs supporting it, there will be a general election in any case.That does not, however, permanently rule out a no-deal Brexit – there is no guarantee what the result of that election would be.The alternative is that Johnson does not face – or wins – a vote of no confidence. The timetable would then proceed along the lines that the prime minister has set out. Parliament will be suspended during the week of 9 September and negotiations with the EU can continue during the party conference season.On 14 October, MPs will return to the House of Commons for a Queen’s speech setting out Johnson’s domestic priorities. Three days later, Johnson will go to a European council meeting of the EU27, at which he would want them to ratify a new deal. If the EU does not ratify a new deal, the legal default is still that the UK would leave the bloc on 31 October without a deal.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no over-arching post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.If the EU does ratify a new deal, Johnson would have a few days for MPs to debate and agree to it. The UK would then leave the EU with a deal, and all the signs are that Johnson would most likely call a general election shortly afterwards.If MPs do not pass the deal – they rejected Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement three times – then the UK would again default to leaving without a deal on 31 October.It is important to note, of course, that whatever the outcome on 31 October, this will not be the end of Brexit by a long stretch. The deal only sets out what happens during a transition period, during which the government will want to negotiate a new free-trade agreement with the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d29fc42048f55e895641e7f632d2c7cfc77ac0cc/0_0_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f2ebbc74f0de9900956a5dd5c9dc349","title":"uk political parties rise donations conservative labour snap election","story":"Conservative and Labour war chests bolstered by prospect of autumn snap electionA total of £15m was donated to Britain’s political parties between April and June, more than double the sum received in the first quarter of this year.Amid speculation of an autumn snap election, parties have significantly bolstered their campaign war chests.The Electoral Commission said an extra £8m was accepted by 16 parties in the second quarter of this year than between January and March.The Conservative party appears to have been buoyed by its change in leader, after Theresa May announced in May that she would be standing down as prime minister.Her departure triggered a leadership contest that was dominated by her successor, Boris Johnson, and his pledge to deliver Brexit by the 31 October deadline – a promise that appears to have attracted donors.The date on which the Commons returns from summer recess.Sajid Javid\u0026nbspis expected to start a fast-tracked spending review, promising a cash boost for schools, hospitals and policing. The swift timing of the review comes after his first major speech by the chancellor was\u0026nbspabruptly cancelled by the Treasury\u0026nbspwith less than 24 hours’ notice.Prime minister Boris Johnson has asked the Queen to prorogue parliament during this week. MPs were due to have a recess period anyway for the party conference season. However, proroguing parliament will severely limit the time MPs have to legislate against no deal or hold and win a vote of no confidence in the government.\u0026nbspThe Labour and Conservative party conferences are due to be held on consecutive weeks.This is the date that Johnson is proposing parliament returns for the Queen’s speech setting out a legislation programme for his government.EU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK\u0027s extension is due to expire. They could possibly agree a new deal at this point - with just about enough time for Johnson to try and get it through parliament.The six-month article 50 extension will expire, and prime minister Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on that date.A possible date for a general election if Johnson has been unable to force through his plans, although the date could be sooner if an election is called as a result of the parliamentary showdown between the prime minister and MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexitin early September.The Electoral Commission reported the Conservative and Unionist party received the highest number of donations of the 16 parties to declare their earnings, taking £5,410,957 in the three-month period. Of that, £5,344,058 was given as donations and £67,000 as public funds.The second highest total was reported by Labour, with Jeremy Corbyn’s party receiving £5m, and £2.9m of public funds accepted as part of the overall sum.The Liberal Democrats received £1.8m, with £1.2m given as donations and £600,000 as public funds. The party pulled off its best-ever local election result in May when it returned 1,359 councillors – half of them gains against rivals.Nigel Farage’s fledgling Brexit party received more than £1m in the second quarter, helping it win 29 seats in the European parliament in May, more than any other party contesting the poll.The Scottish National party accepted £493,000 in donations, while the Green party, which has a single MP, accepted £174,000. The lowest recorded donation total was £6,000 for the Radical party.Political parties are required to submit quarterly donation and loan returns to the Electoral Commission. They must report donations accepted above the £7,500 threshold along with impermissible donations.Louise Edwards, the director of regulation at the commission, said: “Publishing data about party donations and loans on our online database means voters can clearly see where political parties receive their funds from. This leads to a more trusted and transparent political finance system and helps ensure compliance.“Where parties fail to deliver their return on time, and there is no reasonable explanation for such a failure, we will take a robust approach in dealing with this in line with our enforcement policy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ddd7d76a4d2969208d9ca7d7950e1d17da3e8cd/579_38_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8122a16ead249047c832034fe1d5c08c","title":"we need to talk about the menopause as loudly as we can says campaigner","story":"Campaigner, who was once a fixture on the Britpop scene, had no idea what was going on when she became perimenopausal“I consider myself a woman of the world and I didn’t know what being perimenopausal was,” says Meg Mathews, the former music PR. But since launching a blog about the menopause in 2017, she has become a prominent campaigner on the subject.Mathews believes the subject is not discussed as much as it should be. “We need to talk about the menopause as loudly and as much as we can because we have to get past the stigma and shame our society places on the menopause,” she says. “We have to break the taboo.”Now 53 and on hormone replacement therapy, Mathews started going through her menopause at 49, although she now thinks she was perimenopausal in her early 40s. It hit her hard, but she had no idea what was going on.“The only thing I knew about the menopause was hot flushes and no more periods – but I wasn’t getting those two symptoms,” she says. Mathews later found out through her own research that she had been suffering 32 of the 34 lesser-known symptoms of menopause, including burning mouth, mood swings, problems sleeping, hair loss and low libido. Her GP prescribed her antidepressants to no effect.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“But I couldn’t tell anyone: my mum had recently died, so I couldn’t talk to her, and we all know about ‘Meg Mathews’ rock and roll lifestyle’,” she says, referring to her reputation as a fixture on the 1990s Britpop party scene – she was married to Oasis’s Noel Gallagher for four years. “I thought it had all caught up with me,” she says. “I told everyone I had glandular fever and didn’t go out of the house for three months.”Then, at an AA meeting, she stood up to tell the room that she thought she was going mad. “A woman approached me afterwards, saying that I wasn’t going mad I was having my menopause. I went to an NHS menopause clinic, which I didn’t even know existed, and the light switched on. I was like, ‘Oh God, I have had all those years feeling like this – why isn’t it talked about?’”Making sure the menopause is talked about has become one of Matthew’s driving forces. In 2017, she started a blog about the menopause. It features articles and Q\u0026ampAs from menopause specialists, real-life experiences – including her own – and lists of products Mathews says have helped her.The blog has been a runaway success, with a million visitors in its first six months. “I’ve held two conferences in London with a range of the country’s best specialists talking on a wide range of topics. For the second one, in May this year, the tickets sold out,” she says.Mathews has given talks in unlikely places, including at the Foreign Office’s services ision: “They opened the phone lines to every embassy and Commonwealth office around the world so that they could listen in, too,” she says. “It went so well that they invited me back to their main office in Milton Keynes to talk to their employees there.”She has spoken at the British Library and the BBC, and is in discussions to speak at another government department.This, says Mathews, is just the start. “I want to take my conferences nationwide,” she says. “I want to help women create a sisterhood network, like Weight Watchers, where they meet weekly in a village hall-type setting to discuss their symptoms and swap advice because many women don’t have anyone to talk to – we’re in a bubble in London. I have learned everything just through my network of women.”Mathews plans to lobby the government for trained nurse practitioners to act as the first port of call for women experiencing menopausal symptoms – and to persuade writers of soaps to include a menopause storyline.“There have been storylines about paedophiles, rape, murders and drug addiction, LGBT issues – but they have never had Bet Lynch behind the bar having a hot sweat,” she says. “Soaps play a pivotal role in helping to start conversations within families on a national scale. So many women probably don’t know how to explain to their husbands what’s going on.

Back then it was in the possession of Martin Johnson, the side’s captain, an indomitable character whose face wore the evidence of a career that started in the amateur days when the sport connived at lawlessness and duelling was a game within a game.The former Wales and Pontypool second-row John Perkins was the master of four‑play. “I would always give my opposite number a whack in the opening minutes,” he once said. “If there was no comeback, I knew I was in for an easy afternoon.”Johnson’s career did not quite overlap with that of the Welshman: he was not known for his habit of turning the other cheek and in the second half of his career, when professionalism took root, he found himself answering charges that not 10 years before would barely have caused a referee’s finger to wag.Perkins would not get away with it now and not just because of multiple camera angles and citing officers. The awareness of the dangers of concussion has led to punching carrying a stigma: it is 50 years ago that another No 4, the Wales captain, Brian Price, felled the Ireland flanker Noel Murphy with a haymaker at Cardiff Arms Park when the Prince of Wales was part of the crowd, executing a plan to get the back-rower off the field, an act that earned no more than an admonishment from the referee. A repeat today would earn an enforced rest of several months.Maro Itoje does not have to be vigilant for a fist that appears from nowhere. It is the body of the current holder of the jersey worn by Johnson, rather than his face, that bears witness to the demands of the professional game. The Saracens lock epitomises the best of the modern-day player, athletic, powerful and composed, driven but in control.His performance against Ireland at Twickenham last Saturday was Johnsonian in its impact if not in its manner. Johnson oozed competitive zeal, the first one out of the trench: when Ian McGeechan chose him as the Lions captain in 1997 for the tour to South Africa, the second-row did not then lead his country. He was tall and imposing in a series McGeechan knew would be swayed by the physical contest.Itoje’s enforcing comes through his reading of the game, his rugby intelligence, and England are stronger for his presence. Manu Tuilagi was named man of the match against Ireland, understandably so for the impact he made with and without the ball, vexing a defence that lacked its customary sharpness off the line, but it was Itoje who lubricated England’s engine, from the opening minute when he forced a turnover.Tuilagi is conspicuous but a lot of Itoje’s work is, if not unseen, barely noticed. He facilitates, winning lineouts and sabotaging the opposition, alert for opportunities after a tackle and on hand to sustain attacks. He is adding ball-carrying to his armoury and at 24 still has to peak.Four years ago, he was in England’s training squad for the World Cup but failed to make the cut. Had Eddie Jones been the head coach then, he would surely have been chosen not as someone likely to make the 23 for the major group matches, but as a young, hungry forward whose head would not drop if he remained on the sidelines.Jones said before announcing his squad for Japan that the most important positions in the 31 were the first 15 and the last four. He has gone for the largely untried and untested in the latter group, rather than experienced players who have served him well in the past three years, tyros who will not have to mask disappointment and therefore not drain squad morale.England’s previous two World Cup campaigns were blighted by tension within the group that proved undermining. Jones is a coach for whom the World Cup provides a power surge: he has lost two matches in three tournaments, in the 2003 final to Johnson’s England and to Scotland four years ago when he was in charge of Japan.He appreciates the rigours of a tournament that has broken many a good team. The physical demands placed on his players since taking charge at the end of 2015 have been designed not just to make them comfortable with the ever-increasing pace and intensity of the international game, but to harden them mentally so that when they get to the closing moments of a game that is in the balance, they do not lose their heads, as they did against Wales and Australia in their home tournament in 2015.Itoje is central to that, focused and unruffled. He has in the past conceded penalties in testing the tolerance threshold of referees at the breakdown but he did not give away one against Ireland, putting experience to advantage. He is seen as a future England captain, but he would be a Sam Warburton, leading through example and his sheer will to win, rather than a Johnson, whose demeanour camouflaged a great rugby brain that, for the past eight years, has been wastefully lost to the English game.Leadership was a concern for Jones a couple of years ago but now he has it covered in all areas of the pack through Jamie George, Itoje and Billy Vunipola and in Owen Farrell, George Ford and Ben Youngs behind. They are bubbling at the right time and Jones knows Japan, its climate and culture. They will be ready and they have Itoje to the fore.• This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

A red rivulet drips down her face from a cut above her left eye but she gives a thumbs up and smiles for the camera, blinking the salty spray and the blood out of her eyes.It seems like a lucky escape.“I saw her a couple of minutes ago, she’s real happy,” a commentator reports during a television highlights show. “She has a little tiny scar up there, they didn’t have to put stitches in, she got some glue and she’s back out here enjoying the fun.”Maidana started vomiting that night. She was diagnosed with a mild concussion after a scan at an emergency room and told to rest. She returned home to Hawaii with a black eye. A few days later her mind and her body began to fail.At the time of the competition in March 2014 at Nelscott Reef, a two-hour drive from Portland, Maidana was one of the best big-wave surfers in the world. Since taking up the sport in her early twenties she had worked tirelessly, obsessively, spending hours each day developing her skills in the wild waves on Maui’s famous North Shore and hours on land building up her fitness.Yet within weeks of her board smashing into her forehead she could barely get off the couch or hold a conversation. Her tongue was leaden. She was too weary to walk her dog. Even sending a text message was exhausting. She was dizzy, confused, anxious, depressed and paranoid. Three months after the accident she got orced.“My world just crumbled. I lost my husband, my dog, my house, my sponsorship, I had a coaching business, I couldn’t do it any more. I lost everything,” she recalls. “The cut, the cut in your eyebrow! We were all concerned about the blood, instead of what’s happening underneath.”While concussions in major contact sports, notably American football, attract most of the research and media attention, traumatic head injuries in surfing are the shadow amid the sunshine – rarely discussed and poorly understood despite their potentially devastating effects.Studies suggest a significant minority of surfers suffer head injuries that carry a risk of cognitive decline in addition to the immediate danger of drowning.An analysis of surfing-related concussions on the west coast of Canada by Nikolaus Dean at the University of British Columbia in 2018 found that the sport’s culture “encouraged risk-taking behaviors and the denial and downplaying of the injury”. There is a reluctance to wear protective headgear, limited medical help and established protocols compared to major team sports and peer pressure to return to the waves without adequate recovery time.“The lifestyle is all happy, we’re at the beach, and the sponsors show that image,” Maidana says. “Nobody talks about concussions in surfing and nobody ever wants to talk about mental illness.”Another elite big-wave surfer, Shawn Dollar, set a world record in 2012 by paddling into a 61ft wave. He also competed at Nelscott Reef in 2014. The following year he smashed into a boulder while surfing in a remote location off the central Californian coast, breaking his neck in four places and suffering a concussion. He had to walk with assistance for a mile to reach his car and be driven to hospital.Bones healed but his brain is still a work in progress. “It looked like I’d played the equivalent of high school, college and professional football,” he says. “I’ve had a full recovery but I still am improving, honestly, I still have to take care of myself every day. I’m doing really, really well but it’s taken, like, three years and a lot of work.”He felt less mentally sharp after the blow. “I was kind of paying attention to what was going on in the news with the NFL and stuff like that but I was a little bit in denial about it, it just seemed crazy that I could be experiencing those type of things just from surfing. And there wasn’t any data out there but I was noticing that I was getting more foggy-headed and slower over time, it was affecting my well-being,” he says.Maidana returned to the water but eventually realized that she was “causing concussions over my concussions. Like a boxer’s brain, basically.” In dire need of money, with her medical care not covered by insurance, she tried delivering pizza and cleaning houses but was too unwell.To force herself away from the ocean she moved to Austin, Texas, and took a job in a cafe. “A doctor told me when I got to Austin, ‘you are an inch from a stroke’, if I kept surfing,” she says. “I removed myself from the island to heal to save my life.”At one point, when she did not maintain a strict healthy diet, she had suicidal thoughts. “It was like - just end it, just end it, just end it. A lot of it was the nostalgia of what I lost. ‘Life without big-wave surfing is nothing, look what your life was before, living at the beach, you were in Hawaii, now you’re in Austin, you’re a waitress, life sucks’, basically. And it was so scary.”“It was like a horror movie, so much time underwater, it was just so violent what was happening, the beating in my body and the lack of oxygen. I truly was one inch from dying. I really felt: OK, the next moment I’m going to be on the other side. It was OK, I was peaceful about it. In a way I wanted it to end because I was feeling really bad, I just wanted the peacefulness.”But she did not seek treatment: “I didn’t get hit, I’m breathing, that’s all I need,” she thought. Then the waves in Nelscott were higher than she expected.“That’s when the terror started to creep in, I was very nervous, very uncomfortable in the water. A 35ft wave, nowhere to go, that’s the moment where you have to ditch your board and e as much as you can, go under the wave. I freaked out, that’s when I think the PTSD came, I froze, I saw the wave and I just didn’t do anything and it just took me,“ she says.“It hits me underwater with the lip of the wave - imagine a 35ft wave bringing a 10ft board that’s like a table, into my forehead. I got hit, I felt a quick in-and-out, black stars, pulled my inflatable vest. When I went black, I was like, come back – because if you don’t come back right now, you go.”Daniel Amen, a doctor in California who has treated numerous surfers, including Maidana and Dollar, often finds they have frontal lobe brain injuries which affect judgment and impulse control.“The surfer of a 30ft wave has to be incredibly coordinated and make split-second decisions well, now they’re not quite so good and it means they’re more likely to get another concussion because in their heads they’re going ‘I can do this’ but their processor isn’t reacting as it should,” he says.Maidana hopes her experience will raise awareness of the perils of big-wave surfing. Dollar suspects a culture shift will be hard to achieve. “I don’t think helmets are going to make a difference, I think it’s about surfers being aware that when they take off on a giant close-out wave just for, like, a photo, they could suffer brain damage from that wipeout,” he says.“When I talk to the younger guys they’re aware of what I went through and they’re asking questions like how can they prevent it themselves, how can they take care of themselves, what have they got to do. At the end of the day they’re still all charging really hard and getting hurt constantly. There’s an awareness out there but there isn’t really a change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd5bd6b039eff5aa7e51d0118c2d60e7b1e256ec/340_574_1110_666/master/1110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72f981e11e964721aafc2f281c6bbaa2","title":"fleabag stage theatre show phoebe waller bridge","story":"Six years after its debut, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s monologue is back in the theatre after its tearaway success on TV. We sent three millennial critics to watch itAfter six years, two television series, several theatrical revivals (including a sold-out Off-Broadway run) and a shot-for-shot French remake, Fleabag is back in theatres for one final run: just Phoebe Waller-Bridge, alone on a spotlit stool, performing the one-woman show that made her the toast of Hollywood. Since it’s been widely perceived as a tract on millennial womanhood, we assembled three millennial critics for a discussion on the play’s relevance, cult status and sexual politics.Kate Wyver: After the TV show, the play felt like going to a gallery and looking at the artist’s sketchbooks. The show is just so much more developed, so the play can’t help but feel a little disappointing.Laura Snapes: I liked seeing the original source material. But the play was originally such a bolt from the blue. If you see it now, you’re always aware: that’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge. When it’s freighted with the phenomenon, it doesn’t work.Hannah J Davies: It was like MTV Unplugged – something you already know in a more intimate form. There was a sense that people weren’t getting gratification from connecting with the show, but from seeing someone famous in an intimate setting. People had an expectation that they wanted to see replicated and she did it.KW: Did she get a massive cheer as soon as she walked on?HJD: Yeah. People were taking photos. The woman next to me laughed at every single line.KW: The laughs were disproportionate to how funny the jokes actually were. The woman next to me paid £177 to be there and ran out when it finished to get a photo and an autograph. It felt like the cultural capital of being able to say, “I was there”. The crowd was mouthing along.KW: Yeah – people pre-empting the laughs, knowing exactly what’s going to happen.HJD: I understand singing along to a band, but theatre is meant to be a quiet experience.KW: No! I wish people could interact with it more because that was the original idea. You’re in this tiny 60-seater and you feel as if she’s whispering just to you. It removes the intimacy – I did not feel any intimacy in that room. Did it feel intimate to you?LS: At first, she was looking into the middle distance, and I thought, that’s not going to work. But she started making eye contact. You could see men squirming. What did you think of the play on a technical level?KW: It’s a tough task to keep an audience engaged for an hour when you’re not moving. I couldn’t look away.LS: You saw a lot more of Waller-Bridge as a physical comedian – especially impersonating all the repressed men in her life. Her face had to do a lot more work than on TV, which was all about the aside. In the theatre, it was all aside, in a way.HJD: There was one aside where she’s talking about the sister’s husband, and she says, “He’s not even sexy enough to beat his wife.” And then she says, “Joking!” I couldn’t tell if that was an aside from Fleabag or Waller-Bridge? On TV it’s much more wink-wink. I needed it to feel different for it not to feel like a cash cow.LS: It’s symptomatic of our cultural inability to let anything end: the franchise of the franchise of the franchise.KW: As a play, you could tell it was six years old. The monologue is solid but nothing hugely special. And the staging is incredibly ordinary. I’ve just been at the Edinburgh fringe, where I saw 50 more exciting shows. And when you think how many plays are struggling for a stage, it feels slightly unfair when the same thing gets done again. But then, has there ever been a one-woman show in the West End that has been so financially viable? That in itself is incredible.HJD: Does it feel dated because people have tried to replicate it?KW: Possibly. In interviews from 2013, when they first staged it, Waller-Bridge says things like, “You don’t see these characters. Women don’t get to be hedonistic and vulgar and dirty and horny.” And now there’s a lot more of that.LS: Something I’ve found weird is the conflation of Waller-Bridge, who is aspirational because she’s a young woman who made a trailblazing TV show, and the character of Fleabag, into this broad “relatable” figure. Do you think the character is relatable?HJD: It comes back to the piece we published about class in Fleabag. The cultural product that Waller-Bridge has made is inherently part of her experiences and it’s only as relatable as the experiences she’s had. She would have made it anyway, whoever she was – but it would have been very different.LS: The play was interesting because the staging is so simple – obviously she’s a thin, quite posh white woman, but you don’t see her dad’s house, which is one of the big class tells in the TV show. So it doesn’t have the same baggage. I think the construct of Fleabag tries to reject the basics of relatability. It actively tries to resist people relating to the character in a superficial way. She doesn’t have any cultural signifiers, so you can’t relate to her because you both like the same bands or books, and she dresses plainly. It’s kind of a clean emotional slate – although obviously as a white woman she’s seen as a cultural “default”, so she eschews the baggage that a woman of colour would automatically have to carry.KW: There’s that line in Lady Bird where someone says, “love and attention, it’s basically the same thing”. Fleabag feeds off that. I can really understand that and also love how she covers her insecurities with cynicism and humour.LS: In the play, she’s surprisingly cruel compared to the show. There are several fat jokes. I was sitting next to a large guy, who was laughing, but I wondered how he felt.KW: There’s also a line about getting with a girl when Fleabag has a boyfriend, and how “that doesn’t count”. People would leap on that now. I think they made her less cruel for TV.HJD: I think producers know that people want characters to be “complicated”, but ultimately relatable. They’re part of a pile of things you’re meant to like – your Sally Rooney or whatever. How much you actually relate to those specific characters, I think, is by the by. It’s more how you relate to the group you’re meant to be in.LS: This reminds me of that great New Yorker essay about how the phenomenon of Sex and the City became bigger than the show, and so in turn SATC started to live up to those perceptions. With Fleabag, the phenomenon is almost separate to the thing. Nobody is even considering those cruel lines about weight and sexuality. Did seeing the play change your interpretation of it? I got a much stronger sense that it was about the effects of pornography on a generation of young women. That feels like something we were talking about six years ago.KW: That’s what Lyn Gardner says in her original review. Those issues are still massive for teenagers, although the impact of pornography feels like a less vital topic of conversation now.LS: And her lack of boundaries – the issue of a woman taking advantage.HJD: I wonder how much of a creative or commercial decision it was to do the play again?LS: What she’s getting out of this – I like interviewing musicians at the end of a tour, two years after they’ve released an album and they know the limitations of the work and it no longer feels like them. I want to hear her do a proper postmortem. Do you think Fleabag is feminist?KW: I think she is because she has been told that she can do what she wants and she follows that rule. And that does come from a place of privilege. And her attitude to sex is so honest. Actually, I’m not sure.LS: I don’t know. Her porn habits – gangbang, teens – probably aren’t ethical, and she’s relentlessly cruel. I think her moral and psychological compass exploded after her mum and best friend died. She’s not even at a point where she’s grasping for values. She’s fulfilling a more immediate need for physical and psychological succour. It’s not until series two that she contemplates what it means to be good.KW: The play is feminist. Six years ago, it was challenging. Her dad sending her to lectures about feminism, and the speaker asking if they would trade five years of their life for the perfect body – that tries to defy the ideas of what makes a good feminist. That was definitely exciting then.HJD: These conversations have moved on, but we still sometimes regress slightly – look at Jameela Jamil.LS: Also what complicates that moment is that Waller-Bridge has the perfect body! What happens to this play now?KW: I’m sure every drama student will do it as a monologue. Which is great, because it adds to the interesting ones for women.HJD: I wish it would inspire people to do their own thing rather than just doing what is on trend. It becomes a mould instead of a prompt to think, “Who am I and what are my experiences?”KW: The media is to blame – any play or show featuring a vaguely cynical woman who talks about sex becomes “the new Fleabag”. We need more inventive ways of writing about those people because I’m very happy to see 15 more plays that are about horny, angry women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec38e25b7a1e3c9d1ff0c3063dd6079ae7359fb/7_0_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed9ec5cdf47afdc3d1cc1ccad980a67","title":"apple apologises listen siri recordings","story":"Contractors graded accidental activations including recordings of users having sexApple has apologised for allowing contractors to listen to voice recordings of Siri users in order to grade them.The company made the announcement after it completed a review of the grading programme, which had been triggered by a  report revealing its existence.According to multiple former graders, accidental activations were regularly sent for review, having recorded confidential information, illegal acts, and even Siri users having sex.“As a result of our review, we realise we have not been fully living up to our high ideals, and for that we apologise,” Apple said in an unsigned statement posted to its website. “As we previously announced, we halted the Siri grading program.

Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

From 5.30pm, tiny quails rotated on a grill while their eggs were fried in a doughnut maker, pots and woks bubbled with Thai curries, and stir fries and bamboo sticks full of sticky rice were griddled. Whole salted fish, coils of round sausages and meat skewers were all being barbecued over hot coals. Other foods were ready to go: silkworms, dried shrimps and goong ten, or dancing shrimp (raw translucent shrimps eaten alive with chilli), while green papaya salad was pounded in huge pestles … with as many chillies as you dared.Helen JacksonFez market has to be the best. It’s car-free and donkey-full. The sights, smells and sounds are a wake-up call to all your senses. Our guide Mohammed’s first words were, “Do not lose me as you will never find your way out.” The narrow streets are full of vendors and craftsmen of ceramics, leather, weaving, mending, and food, both to eat there or to cook at home. The donkeys are shod with rubber recycled from tyres to prevent slipping on the cobbles. Handcarts rule – with shouts of “balak, balak” to warn all to move aside as they make their way through the narrow passages. Thankfully we didn’t lose Mohammed and came out the other end.Kate HendyEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The inside of this ornate building has latticed cast-iron pillars, reminiscent of an old Victorian bandstand. Outside, it is at its best at night: when the satay stalls open, the air soon fills with the enticing aroma of sizzling meat. Tables and stools are quickly occupied, and “beer aunties” roam between the crowds selling jugs of ice-cold Tiger. And, as the main market is open all night, it is a jet-lagged traveller’s dream, albeit a hot, smoky and sweaty one!Joanna LawrenceThis market sells a bewildering and extensive variety of secondhand books, whose origins can only be guessed at. The booksellers sit on raised wooden stalls peering over randomly stacked towers of secondhand books. I had many friendly conversations with white-bearded vendors about politics, science, religion and literature. I loved watching mothers dragging reluctant first-year university students around trying to find all the textbooks on their reading lists for bargain prices. The Indian Coffee House on Bankim Chatterjee Street, a famous meeting spot for Kolkata’s intelligentsia, provides a welcome retreat, brilliant eavesdropping opportunities and sugary coffee.TessFrom June each year, Melbourne’s Victoria Market runs a Winter Night Market that is at once a cheap culinary adventure around the world and an opportunity to have moments of random conviviality with locals and travellers while you queue for your halloumi friesdumplingskimchipaellafroyo.

All of this produce is put to good use as Pike’s is home to several independent coffee shops and restaurants that overlook the Pugent Sound. If there is a more perfect way to spend the evening than drinking a craft beer and watching the sunset over Bainbridge Island, I am yet to find it. If you are a fan of grunge music, Pike Place is massively important as it’s opposite the legendary Showbox venue and was also one of the locations in the cult film Singles. Ironically for such an independent venue, it is also the birthplace of one of the world’s biggest brands – Starbucks first ever store is there.• pikeplacemarket.orgJenniferBerlin’s most charming flea market takes place next to the stunning Landwehrkanal every other Sunday. While tourists head to Mauerpark, this is where, to me, the real fun (and bargains) can be found. If you’ve ever wondered where Berliners pick up their unique clothes, answers can be found here. You can quickly assemble a new clubbing outfit from one of the many stalls where hungover Neuköllners are passing on half their wardrobe. There is also plenty of East German kitsch, straight from the attic, beautiful kids’ clothes and toys, and food from Japanese, French and Turkish stalls, which you can eat on the banks of the canal. Go late, like a local, coffee in hand.• tuerkenmarkt.deKatieThe beautiful market building with its statues and flowers was gorgeous, but more astounding were the displays of seafood, fruit and vegetables. The colour and variety of the produce blew my mind. When you realise that this market was threatened with extinction and was saved by a group of merchants, it becomes even more impressive. Fighting the invasion of junk food and big box stores, they formed a non-profit group and eventually were rewarded by the Canarian Government and the Santa Cruz City Hall for restoring the market as a hub for the community.• On FacebookKate HolbrookEl Mercado Central de Atarazanas is the indoor food market in the centre of Málaga, selling fresh local produce. The building is impressive, with a huge stained-glass window at one end, but of equal artistic merit are the displays of seasonal fruit and veg. We watched the fishmongers at work on the latest catch and were tempted by the charcutería and olive stalls. There are a couple of bars inside, opening out on to the street but we retired to an old sherry bar, only a five-minute walk away, to toast our purchases.• malagaturismoMoiraLooking for a holiday with a difference?

It’s hard to argue otherwise. ChuckleVision may have lacked the glamour of Miami 7, the melancholy of Greenclaws or the childhood-scarring terror of Alfonso Bonzo, but it had charm by the bucket-load.It helped that it ran and ran – ChuckleVision aired close to 300 episodes over two decades, which meant that it received votes from multiple generations of viewers – but the success of the series lay in the fact it was proudly old-fashioned. ChuckleVision was just two idiots failing at stuff over and over, but it was always executed flawlessly.This was largely because the Chuckle Brothers were old hands. They won Opportunity Knocks in the 60s and New Faces in the 70s. They ran with classic old-school entertainers, honing their craft alongside figures such as Ted Rogers, Lennie Bennett and Freddie Starr. They weren’t afraid of debasing themselves in the name of entertainment, either. Viewers old enough to remember the short-lived 80s series The Chuckle Hounds will marvel at the way they performed their act in great big dumb dog costumes, accompanied by witless swanee whistle sounds. Even so, their personas were already firmly in place. Watch an episode today and you can still tell which Chuckle Hound is Paul and which is Barry.But ChuckleVision is where the pair got to shine. Although we didn’t learn an awful lot about them as characters – why did they have a new job every week? Were they on the run? Did they kill someone? – we did get to watch a succession of pratfalls and catchphrases that were deployed with unbeatable skill. This is why people remember ChuckleVision not for the show, but for the chemistry between the brothers.The Chuckle Brothers were beloved, so much so that viewers have been able to look past their more unsavoury moments, such as when Barry was punched by the husband of a woman to whom he had been sending lewd emails, or when he shared a Britain First post on his Facebook page. To remain a national treasure after this is incredible. No wonder ChuckleVision topped the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bcb5f8c52abeee369f21897a4a68253f268f37/0_95_952_571/master/952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae430859dafe81f6708d0ec743bbf875","title":"chinese troop movement into hong kong prompts unease","story":"Movements, which have been portrayed as a scheduled troop rotation, come days ahead of anti-government protestsChinese military vehicles have been seen moving across the border into Hong Kong, in what the military said were regular troop movements, as fears rose that the city could see a Beijing-led crackdown after months of political unrest.Following witness reports of the movements in the early hours of Thursday, state-run news agency Xinhua released a report that the Hong Kong Garrison of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was making a scheduled rotation and that it was an “annual normal routine”.The images published by Xinhua showed armoured carriers and trucks carrying troops at the border, and a naval vessel arriving in Hong Kong.In the previous two rotations – in 2017 and 2018 – state media reports noted that the number of troops and equipment had not changed. This year the report does not include that detail. It is estimated there are between 8,000 and 10,000 troops in the garrison, on either side of the border.The movements come before a major anti-government demonstration planned for Saturday, as Hong Kong nears its third month of mass protests. On Thursday, the organiser of the demonstration, Civil Human Rights Front, received notice that police had banned the event.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongHours after the announcement, Civil Human Rights Front convenor Jimmy Sham and a friend were attacked inside a restaurant by two men in masks wielding baseball bats and knives.While Sham was unharmed, his friend is receiving treatment for injuries sustained during the attack, according to the coalition.Bonnie Leung, a co-convenor of the group, said she thought the attack was intended to scare away protesters from Saturday’s demonstration. Past events organised by CHRF this summer have drawn hundreds of thousands of residents, including families and the elderly, in some of the largest demonstrations seen in Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.The attack is not unprecedented in Hong Kong, which has seen an escalation of violence targeted at protesters, journalists and pro-democracy figures in recent weeks.Last week, three people were stabbed at a “Lennon Wall” in eastern Hong Kong, one of many temporary collections of posters and notes that have gone up across the city to support protesters, according to Hong Kong Free Press.Hong Kong lawmaker Dennis Kwok of the Civic party called the troop movements political posturing. “I believe this is a deliberate posture on the part of the PLA to tell or warn the Hong Kong people that it may be deployed,” Kwok told public broadcaster RTHK.“As I said time and again, the use of troops in Hong Kong will be the end of Hong Kong, and I would warn against any such move on the part of the central people’s government.”The protests, triggered in June by an extradition bill that would send suspects to mainland China, represent the sharpest challenge to Beijing’s authority since the handover. In recent weeks, China has issued increasingly severe warnings.The PLA released a propaganda video earlier this month showing armed police and soldiers subduing people in yellow hard hats and black tops, the unofficial uniform of the Hong Kong demonstrators.As concerns about a possible crackdown intensify in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Internet Service Providers Association said on Wednesday it was troubled by reports that the local government might issue an executive order to block selective websites or applications.It said such an order would be the “end of the open Internet of Hong Kong” and “permanently deter international businesses from positing their businesses and investments in Hong Kong”.The group also said it would be an ineffective move as it “would not deter nor stop determined users from accessing their desired services” through a virtual private network (VPN)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3358e8ef33d5ab6bbe0a971593c573f53e479233/0_207_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2378fd9299a65893ee34d95877b4c08b","title":"hurricane dorian florida declares state of emergency","story":"Puerto Rico was spared, but storm is expected to land in Florida Sunday night, potentially as a category 3 hurricaneAs Puerto Rico’s citizens breathed a sigh of relief Thursday morning at having avoided major damage from Hurricane Dorian, Florida declared a state of emergency and residents buckled down for the storm’s anticipated arrival toward the end of the Labor Day holiday weekend.The latest computer modeling of Dorian’s path showed it arriving as a strong storm, potentially a Category 3 hurricane, on Florida’s east coast. The national hurricane center in Miami warned of dangerous storm surge and hurricane-force winds but said “it is too soon to determine where these hazards will occur”.Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency and urged residents to take precautionary measures including stockpiling water, canned food and other emergency supplies.“Dorian could be a major hurricane,” DeSantis tweeted. “All Floridians on the East Coast should have 7 days of supplies, prepare their homes \u0026amp follow the track closely.”DeSantis said he had spoken on the phone with Donald Trump, who pledged support.“Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night,” Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. (The timing of the arrival of the hurricane was not settled and anyone in its path was advised to track the storm.) “Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions, it will be a very big Hurricane, perhaps one of the biggest!”The hurricane center advised that heavy rains from the storm were expected to occur over portions of the Bahamas, Florida, and elsewhere in the southeastern United States “later this week and into early next week”.With tens of thousands of Puerto Rican residents still living in temporary shelters after the devastation in 2017 from Hurricane Maria, which killed about 3,000 people and destroyed key infrastructure, the island had feared another devastating blow as Dorian bore down.But a calm day dawned on Thursday. “We’re happy because there are no damages to report,” Culebra Mayor William Solís told The Associated Press.Power outages and flooding hit the US Virgin Islands to Puerto Rico’s east, but officials there likewise breathed a sigh of relief.“We are grateful that it wasn’t a stronger storm,” government spokesman Richard Motta told AP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49e1f7de8265c75b4ff48b4216865c3706f9de56/0_56_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81134b0d84b021ef1805f8d416289475","title":"italy president gives giuseppe conte mandate form new government m5s pd","story":"PM to lead coalition of ruling Five Star Movement and opposition Democratic partyThe Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said now is the time to “turn a crisis into an opportunity” after accepting a fresh mandate to try to form a new government that could mark a turning point in Italy’s fractured relations with the EU.President Sergio Mattarella has tasked Conte with securing a pact between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic party (PD) in a move that would oust the far-right League from government and stave off early elections.“It’s a delicate period for the country and we need to exit the political uncertainty soon,” Conte said after a meeting with Mattarella on Thursday. “This will be a new season, a time for relaunch … it won’t be a government ‘against’, but one that is for the citizens and modernises the country.”He also said Italy, one of the founders of the EU, must return to being a “protagonist” in the bloc.This could be Conte’s second chance at leading Italy after he resigned last week, ending a turbulent alliance between M5S and the League. Conte, a law professor, has a few days to ensure M5S and the PD set aside their myriad differences to create a strong and lasting government.The two parties still need to draft a programme and pick a cabinet. One of the hurdles is the role of Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader. The PD insisted he step down as deputy prime minister in return for them accepting Conte as prime minister.The other potential threat is the plan by M5S to ask its members to vote on any agreement with the PD on Rousseau, the online network it often uses to make policy decisions. It is unclear how many subscribers the site has or how votes are counted, but many M5S activists oppose the alliance.If they manage to form a government, the first challenges will be to draft Italy’s budget for 2020 and freeze a hike in VAT. The parties are poised to ask the EU for flexibility with the budget, the first draft of which must be ready by the end of September, in order to “reinforce social cohesion” in the country.“We need to get to work immediately to come up with a budget that avoids an increase in VAT,” Conte said.There were fierce clashes between Italy and the EU over this year’s budget and the country’s huge public debt. Conte, who has repeatedly said Italy would respect EU budgetary rules, has twice managed to avert threats of sanctions.Italy was plunged into chaos this month after Matteo Salvini withdrew his League party from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.The dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. The pair are longstanding enemies but also the two largest parties in parliament.Salvini had also not expected Conte to emerge as his rival. Talks between the PD and M5S progressed after Nicola Zingaretti, the PD leader, succumbed to demands from Di Maio to reinstate Conte.Conte, who was repeatedly dismissed as a “puppet” when governing the M5S-League alliance, has come into his own in recent weeks. He already had a high approval rating, but gained many more fans with an  attack on Salvini in the Senate last week. Conte had previously defended Salvini, but on this occasion accused him of being an “opportunist” only out to pursue his own interests. Conte is also respected in the EU, particularly for his diplomacy skills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f31c16236be2dea6cd9554c711a3d214ae838e23/0_355_5320_3192/master/5320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5db98fcfd7b33d5b29b2e16e179f6b","title":"turkish beekeeper finds thieving bears prefer premium honey","story":"Ibrahim Sedef discovers to his cost that they don’t just settle for the bear necessitiesA beekeeper in Turkey who was harassed by a particularly persistent group of bears has discovered a profound truth: the animals have very expensive tastes when it comes to honey.Ibrahim Sedef, an engineer from Trabzon, north-east of Ankara on the Turkey’s Black Sea coast, struggled to keep his bee hives out of the hands of local bears, despite building storage houses and metal cages.Over three years he estimates he may have lost more than $10,000 worth of honey.Food decoys, including apples, failed to ert the intruders.So he decided to set up recording equipment to track the bears and inadvertently embarked on animal testing of a different kind.Sedef set up four bowls three contained different types of honey – flower, chestnut and Anzer – and one had cherry jam. He wanted to see which one the bears preferred.The footage revealed they had very expensive taste. Their favourite, Anzer honey, is believed to be the most expensive honey in the world. It is produced from the nectar of 90 flowers that grow only in the mountains of the Anzer plateau.In addition to being delicious to bears, some believe Anzer honey has healing qualities for a long list of ailments, including stomach pains, hair loss and wound treatment. It can sell for as much as $300 (£250) a kilogram.Despite his losses, Ibrahim Sedef is philosophical about his hungry visitors. “Despite all this, when I see the footage, I forget all the harm they have done to me, and love them,” he said.Brown bears are the largest carnivores in Turkey and mainly live near the Black Sea and Eastern Anatolian regions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14214f576a018675eb995afaf3922816ce4d14e/0_146_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e7d3773418f248a5c56162d074aa82f","title":"why is china hiding its oil tankers from us trackers","story":"Signs Beijing may be importing Iranian oil as Trump’s two biggest foreign policy headaches convergeIn early June, a Chinese-owned supertanker abruptly went dark in the Indian Ocean, the tracking system signalling its course apparently deactivated.It was not the first ship to vanish from the monitors. The deactivation of transponders that generate a unique ID issued to ships by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has become increasingly familiar in recent weeks to the companies that track tankers.The Trump administration has stepped up its efforts to track tankers linked to China’s biggest state-run oil company in response to signs that the vessels are helping to transport Iranian crude in defiance of US sanctions against Tehran.“They are hiding their activity,” Samir Madani, the co-founder of TankerTrackers, told the New York Times in July. “They don’t want to broadcast the fact that they have been in Iran, evading sanctions. It’s that simple.”The case of the Pacific Bravo, which the US had flagged up as a suspected sanctions breaker, is doubly intriguing. After its unique tracker identifying number disappeared, it reappeared more than a month later attached to a ship listed with a different name, changed in an apparently clumsy effort to disguise it.Other Chinese-owned tankers, several of which are owned by the Bank of Kunlun according to media reports and evidence from tracking companies, have used different tactics. Some have been captured on satellite images interacting with Iranian ships.The events unfolding on the maritime trade routes point to a wider story, of the increasingly complex convergence of two of the Trump administration’s most pressing foreign policy concerns. While Washington seeks to block Iranian oil exports as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force Tehran to negotiate over its nuclear and security policies, China – which is locked in its own escalating trade war with the US – appears to be throwing Iran a significant lifeline.Iran for its part has encouraged China. The country’s first vice-president, Eshaq Jahangiri, told a visiting Chinese official recently that Tehran expected Beijing to be more active in buying Iranian oil.“I think the two issues have been converging for a while,” Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst with the thinktank Crisis Group said.. . “The main reason that China initially complied with the US … policy and significantly reduced oil imports from Iran was because it hoped it could be a card that bore some idends in the trade negotiations. As soon as those talks ran into dead lock, China turned around and resumed oil imports from Iran.”Efforts to evade the sanctions have so far been limited, Vaez and other analysts watching the issue closely say the messaging is clear: China “can make or break the US maximum pressure policy”.Vaez notes, however, that access to Iranian oil is not simply a question of leverage for China, but reflects its long-term strategic aim not to be complicit in US moves it fears may lead to regime change in Iran.“China has a complex calculation regarding Iran. It is the only oil-rich country where the US does not have a foothold. From the point of view of China’s energy needs, Iran is very important,” he said. “But on the other hand China has bigger fish to fry with the US with trade negotiations and it needs to balance relations with other oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia.”Sanam Vakil, a senior researcher at Chatham House, believes the subterfuges currently involved reflect a desire by both China and Iran to avoid an overt confrontation over the issue, as Tehran becomes ever more “creative” about its oil exports.For Vakil, one of the key takeaways has been the Trump administration’s inability to manage the overlapping crises it has fuelled. “It’s unfortunate for US foreign policy that it has so many interconnected crises. It’s impossible for the US government to meet all of of its objectives,” he said.Vaez echoes the sentiment, adding that Chinese imports of Iranian oil may also have discreet support in European capitals still committed to keeping the Iran nuclear deal alive despite Washington’s unilateral withdrawal.“I’m not sure the Trump administration has the bandwidth or the strategic understanding to connect all these dots. That’s why its been own worst enemy. Too many of its main files, including North Korea and Iran, are dependent on how the Trump administration treats China.“In practice, however, this is an administration which, when offered the opportunity to fight too many fires at same time, will jump at it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4000421.1567021807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"council sought garda assistance for sandwich board blitz","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom September 1st, city businesses will have to pay an annual licence fee of €630 to erect sandwich boards outside their premises. Photograph: Nick BradshawGardaí agreed to support a Dublin City Council “blitz” on unauthorised sandwich boards on the city’s streets, minutes of an internal council meeting show.From September 1st, city businesses will have to pay an annual licence fee of €630 to erect sandwich boards outside their premises. However, the advertising boards will be banned completely outside protected structures, such as Georgian buildings, and in 23 architectural conservation areas (ACAs).O’Connell Street, Grafton Street, Capel Street, Dawson Street and the area between Grafton Street and South Great George’s Street are all within ACAs. Suburban areas including Phibsborough, Sandymount and Ranelagh are also covered by the designation.Cafes and restaurants are already liable for licence fees for putting tables and chairs outside their premises, but to date there has been no licensing system for sandwich boards, also known as “A-frame signage”.Council chief executive Owen Keegan previously said he planned a crackdown on businesses that “carpet” the public footpath with unlicensed advertising placards as the public realm in the city centre had become increasingly “littered” with sandwich boards which had no permission to be on the street.Approach to gardaíSince then the council has been developing a policy for dealing with sandwich boards. Minutes of a meeting between its transformation unit and planning enforcement section, at which licensing procedures for sandwich boards were being devised last summer, show an approach had been made to gardaí to support the enforcement of the new rules.Restaurants Association of Ireland chief executive Adrian Cummins said the idea that gardaí would ever have been involved was ridiculous.“To even contemplate using scarce Garda resources for this cosmetic exercise, when there is open drug dealing on our streets, is outrageous,” he said.“The whole way this licensing system has been approached has been in very poor form, the RAI has not been consulted in any of this, when we are members of the council’s business forum. This is not the way to do businesses, it causes animosity and bad blood.”A spokeswoman for the council said the “newly-formed ad-boards unit” which will be enforcing the licensing system has had “no conversations with the gardaí”, and there were currently no plans to seek Garda assistance in enforcement."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"European Affairs Minster calls on Johsnson to put forward alternative backstopApology comes day after 300 Irish employees had contracts ended in tech giant\u0026rsquos Cork facilitySunday will see family tradition passed on to Cabra man\u0026rsquos 11-year-old grandsonRain over the weekend will be \u0026lsquothundery\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoextended\u0026rsquo at times before easing on SundayKeep Ireland Open makes complaint to Wicklow Co Council over erection of new fencing at estateAdams and McGuinness met IRA army council three times to discuss cessationPriest from Mount Merrion raised \u0026euro600,000 for motor neurone causes in a walk last yearFarmers say they have to protest over beef prices as they \u0026lsquocan\u0026rsquot pay their co-op bills\u0026rsquoMan continues to be detained at Garda station following 34-year-old\u0026rsquos death on MondayCiar\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoBoyle\u0026rsquos injuries \u0026lsquoconsistent with falling from elevated height\u0026rsquo, US police sayIt is understood woman suffered a heart attack while swimming at Las Gaviotas beachCrackdown on unlicensed advertising boards begins next weekDr David McKeown, assistant professor UCD school of mechanical and materials engineeringGarda hopeful second vehicle used by Keith Branigan killer yields forensic evidenceOne universe with different determinations of its rate of expansion which do not agreeDepartment has not yet decided what level of qualifications minders must haveCabinet set to approve funding for project next month, says Michael CreedCoroner says inquest will hear about \u0026lsquooffload delay\u0026rsquo at hospital which led to the delay"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4001124.1567074380!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wet weather for electric picnic but gaa final to be cool and bright","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Brendan White   puts up bunting on Clonliffe Road to support Dublin in advance of the All Ireland Football Final at Croke Park on Sunday.Photograph: Alan BetsonThe With half of Croke Park’s 83,000\u0026nbspcapacity set to be disappointed on Sunday, as either Kerry or Dublin lose the All-Ireland Football Final, at least the weather\u0026nbspwill be cool and bright.However, those attending Electric Picnic are set to feel the full vagaries of a late Irish summer with campers facing the possibility of thunderstorms on Friday, followed by constant showers, strong winds, and\u0026nbspoccasional spells of sunshine.According to Met Éireann, the local forecast for the Electric Picnic venue in Stradbally, Co Laois, is for possible thunder and periods of rain throughout Friday, with heavier spells as the day goes on and into the night.The rain is set to become persistent on Saturday with 9mm of rainfall forecast between 1am and 7am.

Photograph: Press EyeAs things stand, the 30,938 people in North Antrim who voted to leave the European Union will see that aspiration become a reality in two months’ time.North Antrim was the Northern Ireland parliamentary constituency most in favour of exiting Europe, with 62.2 per cent of those who voted in the June 2016 referendum supporting Leave compared to the 44.2 per cent average across the North as a whole.The constituency also had a slightly higher percentage of pro-Brexit voters than Blaenau Gwent, statistically the most anti-EU area in Wales, in which 62 per cent backed exiting. Meanwhile, in Moray – the voting area in Scotland most in favour of getting out of Europe – only 49.9 per cent of voters supported Leave.In England, the port town of Dover had the same proportion of Leave voters as North Antrim while in Boston, the UK’s most pro-Brexit place, 75.6 per cent of voters backed the Leave campaign.Three years on from the referendum, for many in North Antrim – the DUP’s heartland – the desire to leave has not diminished, despite the likelihood of a no-deal departure on October 31st.In a 2019 UK-wide online petition calling for the article 50 process (which triggered Britain’s formal EU exit) to be revoked, North Antrim was the constituency in Northern Ireland which had the fewest number of signatories.“They voted to leave. It wasn’t as if we will half leave, we will partly leave, we will leave bits of it. It was very clear, we wished to leave the EU, every aspect of it,” North Antrim’s MP Ian Paisley Jnr said.But why did almost two-thirds of voters in this rural Northern Ireland constituency support Brexit?North Antrim has only ever been represented at Westminster by unionist MPs and, from 1970 onwards, the seat has been held exclusively by members of the Paisley family. As the founder of both the Free Presbyterian Church and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the late Rev Ian Paisley’s fire and brimstone language translated seamlessly from the pulpit to politics.His forceful opposition to the civil rights movement and republicanism in the 1960s represented a fresh, defiant style of unionism that threatened the Tory-affiliated brand – the stance that, since the creation of the Northern Irish state in 1921, had dominated the country’s politics in every practical sense.Revd Paisley first ran for the UK parliament in 1970, winning 41.2 per cent of the vote in North Antrim. When Ian Paisley Jnr took over the reins from his father in 2010, he won 46.4 per cent of the vote.His share dropped marginally to 43.2 per cent at the 2015 general election, just over a year before the Brexit vote, but this increased in 2017, a year after the EU referendum, to 58.9 per cent.The success of the DUP in the 2017 general election – when it won 10 parliamentary seats – put the pro-Brexit party in a position to establish a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative Party which, under Theresa May’s leadership, needed DUP support in order to establish a working majority in the House of Commons.In return for enabling May to form a government, the DUP secured an additional £1 billion for Northern Ireland to be spent over the course of five years. This resulted in the development of an intimate working relationship between the parties.Boris Johnson attended the DUP party conference last year and in July, soon after he became prime minister, he held a private dinner with senior figures in the party. Meanwhile, leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg attended a fundraising event for the DUP earlier this year in Ballymena, the town where Paisley’s constituency office is located.Two-thirds of Ballymena’s residents identify as Protestant, according to the 2011 census, and territory is marked out with Union flags, loyalist paramilitary murals and flags in support of Soldier F, who faces charges over the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings in Derry. There are also republican areas in Ballymena where posters commemorating the 1981 hunger strikers can be found on display.Asked what drove support for Brexit in his constituency, Paisley says: “I’d say about 60 per cent of the reason people voted leave was economic and about 40 per cent of it was emotional.”He said it is a unionist constituency and the people are proud of their Britishness, but that the Leave campaign was also about establishing trade relationships.“I’ve worked in this constituency for over 20 years now and there isn’t a week goes by that I haven’t had a complaint from farmers about the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy,” he added. “After 40 years of experience of working the policy, most farmers said, ‘we’ve had enough of this, this is our chance to say yay or nay to this policy’ and they voted against it.”Robert Hanna (42) is a pro-Brexit farmer from North Antrim. His father bought the land about 30 years ago and he currently has 70 cows and about 60 sheep.“The EU want you to jump through so many hoops in order to do the job that I felt, and still feel, we would be better off doing without the hoops,” he says. “The red tape which they impose is silly and it makes farming difficult. You have people who know nothing about farming telling you what you should be doing and I don’t agree with it.”Earlier this year, Ulster Farmers Union (UFU) president Ivor Ferguson said he feared 50 per cent of sheep farmers could go out of business because of Brexit. He had previously said that a no-deal Brexit would be “catastrophic” for the agricultural industry.Hanna does not agree.“I would take no-deal at this stage. At the end of the day, Germany are still going to want to sell John Deere tractors to the UK.“All of these other European countries too, they need to trade with us. Okay, it might be difficult for a year if there is no-deal but we’ll get there.“The farmers I talk to all voted leave and they still want it. I heard an UFU representative in the media recently saying he speaks for 11,000 farmers here who are against Brexit. I would like to get speaking to that man to tell him that he doesn’t speak for me.”North Antrim suffered some significant pre-Brexit economic hits with the loss of more than 1,600 jobs following the closures of Michelin tyre factory and JTI Gallaher’s cigarette factory – both in Ballymena.JTI Gallaher, which at its peak employed about 2,000 people, announced its withdrawal from Northern Ireland to eastern Europe in 2014. It finally closed its doors in October 2017.In November 2015, Michelin broke the news that it would cease production at its Ballymena site in April of last year, blaming high energy costs as a contributing factor with cheaper options available in Europe. The closure led to about 850 people losing their jobs.Ballymena man Rodney Quigley, who was elected as an independent unionist councillor this year, lost his job at Michelin.“Ballymena was a vibrant town. JTI Gallaher and Michelin were two of the top businesses in Northern Ireland and there was never any chat of either of them closing,” he said. “Some shops have left the town as well. If you said 10 years ago that those businesses would have disappeared from Ballymena, people would have laughed at you. Then, all of a sudden B\u0026ampQ, JTI Gallaher and Michelin all closed. The impact hasn’t really hit home yet.”When asked if he fears that a no-deal Brexit could further exacerbate economic problems in North Antrim, Quigley adds: “The decision had already been made to close Michelin in 2015, JTI Gallaher before that, so there’s no point in people scaremongering. Maybe after Brexit we might be in a better position in that regard.There have been concerns about the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on peace and stability in Northern Ireland.A former loyalist prisoner, who asked not to be named, says he voted Remain.He now helps to run a community project in Ballymena which he considers to be on the progressive wing of loyalism. It works with people who he said had “various roles in defence of unionism and the state” during the conflict.“There’s still a very strong, fundamental religious Protestant community here – the Free Presbyterian element. Those people, biblically, would see it that we shouldn’t be in the EU. That has been part of sermons over the years,” he said.“Certainly, within fundamental Protestant thinking, some people think the EU is the beast mentioned in the Book of Revelations.”Ian Paisley Snr once referred to the EU as a “beast ridden by the harlot Catholic Church”.“That mix of religion and politics is still very strong in North Antrim,” the ex-prisoner added. “We are very polarised, as many communities are, but I think absolutely, Brexit reflected the influence of identity politics here and in Northern Ireland more widely.The DUP opposed the Belfast Agreement in 1998. The party refused to enter into power-sharing with Sinn Féin until 2007.The former prisoner feels that the unionist leadership has failed to grasp how much the referendum result has unsettled the nationalist community in Northern Ireland – which could in turn weaken the union.“We shouldn’t be ramming a Union Jack down people’s throats. We want people to be comfortable to live in Northern Ireland in the years to come and vote to remain in the union,” he says.“The unionist mindset during the Troubles was about defending the Border. I remember in jail we used to say ‘if we get out, we should build a wall’ like Donald Trump. If somebody said to me 30 years ago, we would still be in the UK but there would be no Border I would have found it impossible.“I looked at the Free State as a hostile country. I looked at the gardaí and the Irish Army, big elements of them, as supporting the IRA’s aims. That was my mindset. But I now take a totally different view of where the Republic of Ireland stands.”The man said that Sinn Féin’s support for Remain, during the referendum, made it difficult for many loyalists to support staying in the EU. He also said that many people in North Antrim “absolutely” take their lead from the DUP on political issues.In the village of Ahoghill, local man John Kelly articulated the feelings of many throughout the UK and Ireland regarding Brexit. “Don’t mention that f***ing word to me. Jesus, don’t start. I’ve heard enough about it,” he said.Ahoghill is a 15-minute drive from Paisley’s constituency office in Ballymena. The North Antrim village hit the headlines in 2005 when a period of sustained anti-Catholic intimidation led to some people being forced to leave their homes.Ahoghill falls in Bannside, a local council District Electoral Area (DEA) where two Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) candidates – Stewart McDonald and Timothy Gaston – got the most, and second most, first preference votes respectively in the May council election. Jim Allister is the party’s leader and founder as well as its sole Assembly representative. He defected from the DUP in 2007 and established the TUV due to his former party’s decision to enter into a power-sharing executive with Sinn Féin.Allister remains a fierce critic of the Belfast Agreement and of the DUP and Sinn Féin. “Like the majority of my constituents I believe in national sovereignty and want to be part of a nation that can make its own laws, spend its own money and determine the interpretation of its own laws through its own courts – none of which you can achieve within the super state structures of the EU.”Adding that North Antrim’s people are “very wise,” Allister also feels the idea that the Brexit vote in his constituency was all about identity has been “a bit overplayed”.“It wasn’t only unionists who voted to leave but certainly, unionists are more attached to notions of British sovereignty than non-unionists,” he said.Allister was once a Member of European Parliament (MEP) for the DUP. He stood in the May 2019 European election for the TUV on a pro-Brexit ticket, imploring voters to “do their duty” and ensure two out of the three seats went to unionist candidates.Ending up with more than 60,000 first preference votes which placed him fifth in the overall, he didn’t get elected and, for the first time, just one unionist was returned to Europe from Northern Ireland – the DUP’s Diane Dodds.Dodds’s stance on Brexit mirrors that of her party. The other two Northern MEPs – Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson and Alliance’s Naomi Long–- are anti-Brexit.Valerie Quinn is a senior project manager at a computer software company.Rooted in the North Antrim marching band scene, Quinn became a member of a band from Clough, outside Ballymena, when she was 13 before later joining Dunloy Accordion Band, which she played with for 17 years. She also played in the Portglenone based Killycoogan Accordion Band for six years.The 48-year-old now has a 13-year-old son with her partner of 20 years. She is the chairwoman of a Facebook group called the Ulster Bands Forum, which has more than 16,000 likes. Quinn runs the group on a voluntary basis.More than 80 bands are expected to take part in a parade in the North Antrim town of Ballymoney for Saturday’s Royal Black Institution demonstration.When asked about how she thinks loyalist band members in North Antrim view Brexit, Quinn says: “The band scene is a really broad church. You have university lecturers, graduates, company owners, ministers and people who are unemployed. It has a broad range of views.“I think it’s fair to say that the vast majority of members of the band scene, and its supporters, would be in favour of Brexit. But I know many within the scene who would be Remain as opposed to Leave.“I voted Leave and all my family voted Leave. I don’t regret voting that. If it happened tomorrow again, I would vote the same.”Quinn also says that many people she knows are generally supportive of the DUP’s approach to Brexit. “I know a lot of the politicians in the DUP. Maurice Bradley would be a good friend. I know Mervyn Storey as well. I know Arlene Foster too, through the band scene.”However, she added: “It wasn’t just about identity and it wasn’t just about whether Northern Ireland remains part of the UK or not. I don’t think it’s as simple as that.“We have heard that people didn’t know what they were voting for. My experience is, particularly bandsmen and women, that people became informed.”Quinn believes that many people in bands from North Antrim mistrust Sinn Féin’s position in relation to Brexit.“It’s only natural to have those fears about a united Ireland vote,” she says.“The parallel that I always draw is that if there was a Border poll tomorrow and the result wasn’t for a united Ireland there is a constant ability for re-voting until the decision suits a united Ireland. However, if it went the other way, there is never any opportunity to change that.”The Detail (www.thedetail.tv) is an investigative news website based in Belfast and reports on issues of public interest including Brexit.

Photograph:  Jeff KowalskyAFPGetty ImagesNew opinion polls show Joe Biden with a significant national lead in the Democratic presidential race as the contest heads into the intense autumn campaign season, with senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders rounding out a trio that seems to have separated from the rest of the primary field.The new data, which shows Mr Biden earning the support of about one in three Democratic voters, stands in contrast to a poll published on Monday that showed a virtual three-way tie between Mr Biden, Ms Warren and Mr Sanders at about 20 per cent support each. On Wednesday, the director of that poll called those results an outlier.The latest round of polling suggests that Mr Biden’s national lead – at this early stage in the campaign – has been relatively durable throughout the summer. It has been fuelled in part by the former vice-president’s strong name recognition, calculations about general election viability and goodwill from rank-and-file Democratic voters, even as there are signs of greater volatility on the ground for Mr Biden in the early-voting presidential primary states.Still, national polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate’s mood and of the extent to which various controversies have caught the attention of voters. One of the polls published on Wednesday, conducted by Quinnipiac University, showed Mr Biden as the top choice of 32 per cent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. Ms Warren came in at 19 per cent, and Mr Sanders was at 15 per cent.Those numbers were close to the figures Quinnipiac found at the beginning of the month, with Mr Biden’s standing unchanged despite several weeks of scrutiny over a series of verbal gaffes. Separately, a poll from USA Today and Suffolk University also found Mr Biden at 32 per cent, followed by Ms Warren at 14 per cent and Sanders at 12 per cent. Those numbers stand in contrast to a Monmouth University Poll that drew attention earlier in the week. It showed Mr Biden plummeting 13 percentage points from June, putting him at 19 per cent, with Ms Warren and Mr Sanders at 20 per cent each. On Wednesday, Patrick Murray, director of that poll, said in a statement that it was clear the results had erged from the polling consensus.“It occurs very infrequently, but every pollster who has been in this business a while recognises that outliers happen,” Mr Murray said. “This appears to be one of those instances.” Because there is no national primary, the standing of the candidates in the early-voting primary states may matter far more than nationwide snapshots. Some surveys this summer have shown Mr Biden’s lead in Iowa and New Hampshire ebb since he entered the race in April, and conversations with voters in Iowa have revealed signs of an enthusiasm challenge for the front-runner.Ms Warren and Mr Sanders, meanwhile, have established themselves in a tier above the rest of the Democratic field. No other candidate has consistently reached double-digit support in recent surveys in the Quinnipiac and Suffolk polls, the only other candidates with 5 per cent or better were Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. More than a dozen of the Democrats got just 1 per cent – or less.The Democratic candidates will now have only one presidential debate next month, after two rounds of two-night debates earlier this summer. As of Wednesday’s deadline to qualify for the September debate, only 10 candidates had done so, meaning they can all fit on one stage under the rules set by the Democratic National Committee. The 10 candidates are:Senator Cory Booker of New JerseyMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, IndianaSenator Kamala Harris of CaliforniaSenator Amy Klobuchar of MinnesotaFormer representative Beto O’Rourke of TexasSenator Bernie Sanders of VermontSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: It is hysterically inaccurate to suggest that Boris Johnson has just staged a coupBrexit news latest: MPs who opposed suspending Parliament during Tory leadership campaign need to \u0026#39look into their own consciences\u0026#39Comment: Ruth Davidson\u0026#39s parting speech revealed the only possible route to stopping no dealComment: Have Remainer MPs just been shocked into actually stopping a no-deal Brexit?Britain\u0026#39s first plastic-free nursery swaps artificial toys with wooden ones and bans food in plastic wrapping Ruth Davidson resigns with plea to Boris Johnson to fight for Brexit deal and no-deal opponents to back itAndrew Neil to be given his own Brexit show, BBC announcesComment: No 10\u0026#39s ingenious prorogation move has all the hallmarks of Dominic CummingsStanding Order 24: What is it?

It’s going to be fine.” He went on to slice his finger three times during filming, requiring large plasters.The weekly showstopper challenge saw contestants asked to create the cake of their childhood dreams, with fairy gardens, toadstool houses, pirate islands and purple carousels from the younger bakers and a “retro” rocket from veteran of the group Phil, 56. Despite their difficulties, the bakers appeared to have impressed the judges. Hollywood said: “Every year of Bake Off, the standard has got better and better and better, and I expect this year to be just the same.”Evicted from the tent was 33-year-old support worker Dan, who said his wife had helped him practice along with his “amazing” parents.  “I am not going to miss the baking under pressure,” he said. “I’m just going to miss everyone in that tent.”The Great British Bake Off will be on Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesdays.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Stop hitting your brother! Alexa - put it down, you’re going to break it!These are phrases which, official figures predict, are now more likely to be answered by a technology system than a human. On Thursday morning the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released its annual baby name data revealing the most popular names for boys and girls in England and Wales. Researchers found that the number of baby girls named Alexa has more than halved last year compared with 2017 because of the increased use of the Amazon technology assistant.Last year there were 118 baby Alexas born, meaning that the name was ranked number 380 out of the most popular baby girl names.However in 2017, there were far more baby Alexas, with 301 born that year and leaving it ranked 181 out of the most popular girls namesPopularity of the name Alexa over timeNick Stripe, of the vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names in 2018, although there are the first signs that Oliver’s six-year reign as the number one name for boys is under threat. “Arthur surged into the top 10 boys’ names for the first time since the 1920s, and Ada jumped into the girls’ top 100 for the first time in a century too, both perhaps inspired by characters in the BBC TV drama Peaky Blinders.“On the flipside, the growth in the use of technology assistants in our homes may help to explain why the number of baby girls named Alexa has more than halved compared with 2017. Communicating with young children can be hard enough at the best of times.”The name Alexa had remained relatively stable for a number of years until 2018 when it began to increase. In 2018, there were 657,076 live births in England and Wales. Of these live births, there were 62,729 different names registered in 2018.The influence of the popular BBC drama Peaky Blinders was also apparent in the latest baby name data.Arthur - the name of the character played by Paul Anderson in the TV show - was the only new entry into the top 10 names for boys in 2018, replacing Jacob.There were  3,644 baby Arthurs in 2018, compared to 2,795 in 2017.In the girls\u0027 list, Sophia and Grace replaced Poppy and Lily in the top 10 names for girls.But Ada made a re-entry into the top 100 baby names for the first time since 1924. There were 811 baby Adas in 2018 compared to just 470 in 2017. The character of Ada Shelby is played by the actress Sophie Rundle in the show. The names Ada, Delilah, Ayla, Zoe, Margot and Felicity entered the top 100 names for girls in 2018. However, other more traditional names - such as Delilah, Ayla and Margot made their first ever appearances in the rankings.While some names, such as George, William, Edward and Elizabeth have consistently featured in the top 100 since the early 20th century, most fluctuate in popularity over time.Peaky Blinders-inspired names are on the riseNames which were popular in the 1940s and 1950s tend to feature much lower in the 2018 rankings, while some names which ranked highly in the early 1900s are starting to increase in popularity again.However, while some names for girls are making a return, other names that were popular at the start of the 1900s are now considerably less popular.In 2018, there were fewer than three girls named Gladys, or Marjorie – names that had been in the top 20 in the early decades of the 1900s. However, these names were still in the top 100 in the 1930s and 1940s respectively, which means they are still likely to be within living memory.Researchers also found that the percentage of babies given a name in the top 100 has fallen every year since 1996.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry \u0027s son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor may not yet be a year old, but despite not being born last year, his name has already seen mounting popularity. Although not reaching the highs of the 3,265 baby Archies from 2013, the 2,950 named Archie last year is the highest number since 2014.The new young Shortened names for boys such as Archie, Alfie and Freddie were all in the top 10 for mothers aged under 25 years but were less popular among mothers aged over 35 years.Whereas the full spellings, such as Alfred and Frederick were more popular with older mothers.Comment: It is hysterically inaccurate to suggest that Boris Johnson has just staged a coupBrexit news latest: MPs who opposed suspending Parliament during Tory leadership campaign need to \u0026#39look into their own consciences\u0026#39Comment: Ruth Davidson\u0026#39s parting speech revealed the only possible route to stopping no dealComment: Have Remainer MPs just been shocked into actually stopping a no-deal Brexit?Britain\u0026#39s first plastic-free nursery swaps artificial toys with wooden ones and bans food in plastic wrapping Ruth Davidson resigns with plea to Boris Johnson to fight for Brexit deal and no-deal opponents to back itAndrew Neil to be given his own Brexit show, BBC announcesComment: No 10\u0026#39s ingenious prorogation move has all the hallmarks of Dominic CummingsStanding Order 24: What is it?

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2018 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except Wales where Ava was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. For the second year in a row Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire \u0026amp the Humber, and the West Midlands, while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the third year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Sophia and Grace replaced Poppy and Lily in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Arthur replaced Jacob in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2018, compared with 2017.Ten most popular baby names in 2018The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

But joining up has been expensive and complicated.Now it says the new scheme will allow more people to sign up, allowing the third-party shops that currently offer\u0026nbspout-of-warranty iPhone repairs to do so in a way that is encouraged by Apple.Shops that sign up will get the same parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostic tools as those AASPs, and will still have the option to use third-party parts if they wish. But they will do so without having to pay, which the company hopes will encourage many more people to sign up.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Apple hopes to roll it out to other regions soon.Both big and small companies took part in the trial, and the same is expected to happen as it rolls out more wideley.Apple releases strange new iPhone update“To better meet our customers’ needs, we’re making it easier for independent providers across the US to tap into the same resources as our Apple\u0026nbspAuthorized\u0026nbspService Provider network,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a statement.“When a repair is needed, a customer should have confidence the repair is done right. We believe the safest and most reliable repair is one handled by a trained technician using genuine parts that have been properly engineered and rigorously tested.”The new programme comes amid questions about the right to repair technology products made by companies like Apple. Activists argue that technology companies do not do enough to let people fix their own devices, but the new scheme will not offer any way for normal iPhone owners to do repairs on their own.Instead, Apple aims to make it easier for customers to have their out-of-warranty iPhone repairs done by verified people, which could allow phones to live on for longer.Companies will not pay to join the new independent repair program, and they will be able to buy the parts and tools used to fix the phone at the same cost as AASPs. Anyone who tries to join it will need to\u0026nbsphave a member of staff go through a 40-hour Apple training programme, which is also free, giving them certification.They will also have to commit to return the parts that are fixed to Apple. The company will then attempt to recycle them – and, if that isn\u0027t possible, will send them through the intensive process that allows Apple to pull out the re-usable materials from old parts.Apple will continue the run the AASP programme, and expects those companies that are currently a part of it to stay. Shops that are part of that older scheme will still get access to extra benefits, including the ability to do repairs that are part of a warranty, in addition to those that are outside of it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found multiple “suspicious offers” in all of them apart from Sainsbury’s.Among the “misleading” discounts it discovered was an offer at Iceland to buy two packs of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut for £4, which works out as £2 each. However, the pack price was just £1.49 a week earlier.Morrisons promoted Cathedral City Mature Cheddar Cheese as “was £3.50 now £2” for a week in September, even though the product was available for £2 the month before.Meanwhile, Asda labelled Wall’s Carte D’Or Strawberry Ice Cream “was £3.50 now £2”. But the 1l tub was sold at £2 for longer, with the so-called special offer running only for 12 weeks.Created with Sketch.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAccording to the Which? High Street survey 201929 8. House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesFollowing a Which? complaint in 2015, the government published new guidance to make sure retailers’ pricing practices comply with consumer law. The rules state that information presented to consumers must be fair, must not waste time or cause disappointment, and should not lead buyers to overspend.“Four years on from our super-complaint on misleading pricing practices, many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?.“These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals and spurious special offers.”Which? will report its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and Ms Hitchins urged the CMA to intervene if necessary.Only two of the supermarkets responded to Which? when presented with the findings. Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good. And I didn’t want to do something that I – that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up – and didn\u0027t want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn’t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: It’s weird kind of representing something you don\u0027t particularly like. A few weeks later, he added how he would have “mindlessly hated the series had he not appeared in it.While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a dex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. I hated it. I really hated, she told Elle. I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, \u0027It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica\u0027.Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool – who he later played – shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch.Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. Every single scene, I\u0027m like \u0027really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God’. Even my American accent, I can\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s awful, she told the . Hopefully it\u0027s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, \u0027Oh God, I want to do that again.\u0027“I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,” Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better. Thankfully, Pfeiffer\u0027s nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma\u0027s cult classic Scarface. Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,” she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit. Meeeeeow. 1434 Christopher Plummer – The Sound of MusicThe Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. “I think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.”Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. Daredevil didn\u0027t work at all, the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. “If I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of ‘put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque’.”1634 Sylvester Stallone – Stop, or Mom Will ShootOne of Hollywood’s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it “maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.”1734 Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City 2Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she’s not open to criticising the second film. I can see where we fell short,” she told an audience at Vulture festival. “I understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin’ money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.” Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it “the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s.Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: Miami Vice? I didn\u0027t like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.”There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil’s Own. He called the film a disaster and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I\u0027ve ever seen.Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. “I did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote on Twitter. “My apologies”.Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. “I step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy’s ass sometimes, he told Men\u0027s Fitness. He’s done some kind of cool things with some cool people – he did that one thing that was funny – but, I mean, he’s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.2334 Shia LaBeouf – Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullCharlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. “Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,” she told Esquire in 2007. “But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself – that’s why I did it.”The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,” she told Howard Stern of playing the character, “and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West – some of Hollywood’s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. “Let me just say that I’d actually thought I’d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,” he said of the role. “I thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn’t.”2734 Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter and the Half Blood PrinceDirector David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. Your Highness? That movie sucks, Franco told GQ. You can\u0027t get around that.Matt Damon’s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent’s “Films to watch before you die” list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position, Damon told GQ. I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.“It\u0027s the worst film I have ever made,” the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. “When my kids get out of line, they\u0027re sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.3234 Alec Baldwin – Rock of AgesThere are some actors who know they’re making a disaster midway through production. “It was a complete disaster,” Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. “A week in you go, ‘Oh God, what have I done?\u0027”Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, \u0027Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we\u0027re dealing with,\u0027 he told GQ. So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, \u0027Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?\u0027 And then they explained it to me: it wasn\u0027t written by that Joel Coen.Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by , What is the worst job you\u0027ve done? What has been your biggest disappointment? and If you could edit your past, what would you change? the actor had only one answer: Super Mario Brothers.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films.

The funniest lines from the ‘seismically stupid’ SerenityMatthew McConaughey ‘furious’ after new film becomes his biggest flop Matthew McConaughey explains why he stopped making rom-coms“He has a passion for teaching, and for all things cinematic, that is palpable, even infectious,” said Noah Isenberg, chair of the Department of Radio-Television-Film.McConaughey previously graduated from the Film Studies programme at the University in 1993, the same year he made his star-making film debut in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused.McConaughey’s first semester of classes will see him once again teach about the making of The Gentlemen, along with the making of his 2012 film Mud, with its director Jeff Nichols scheduled to visit for one seminar. A reading list includes script drafts, shot lists and storyboards, while students will be taught about pitching and workshopping their own scripts.“We are proud to welcome Professor McConaughey to officially join our world-class faculty,” said Moody College Dean Jay Bernhardt. “Matthew cares deeply for our school and our students, and we are thrilled that he shares his time and talent to help prepare the next generation of media leaders and innovators.”University of Texas\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once it arrives to Mars it will use its own onboard engines to navigate its way safely to the Martian surface. One of the biggest breakthroughs of the Starhopper and Starship is that they run on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, which can both be found and manufactured on Mars.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.He was also asked whether his boyfriend, model Jacob Bixenman, would give him a “hall pass” so Sivan could sleep with fellow artist Shawn Mendes, who in the past has denied rumours that he is gay.“Next time I’ll just do a Twitter q\u0026ampa,” he added.Sivan’s latest studio album Bloom was released in 2018 to critical praise, and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 chart.Troye Sivan\u0027s calibre of pop deserves to be heard in arenas – reviewTroye Sivan\u0027s album \u0027Bloom\u0027 is a harmonious and vital pop recordOften designed to replicate the twinkling, tinny echo of vintage synths in a stadium setting – the work of producers like Haim favourite Ariel Rechtshaid, who makes his mark on the heart-swelling ballads “The Good Side” and “Animal”, and Oscar Holter, the man behind the surefire future single “Plum” – the whole record rejects modern pop tropes to bask in a rare kind of Eighties sonic glory.\u0026nbspLast year Sivan\u0026nbspreceived a Best Original Song nomination at the Golden Globes for “Revelation” from the film Boy Erased, in which he also had a supporting actor role.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What those people need is genuinely affordable social homes.”While the 20 per cent reduction was not included in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government’s (MHCLG) statement, a spokesperson confirmed ministers were considering the proposals and said it would offer further details “in due course”.The proposals that were officially announced by the government on Wednesday morning were met with mixed reactions.More than 210,000 children homeless in England, finds reportCurrently, those using the shared ownership scheme can only purchase their home in increments of 10 per cent, which can be prohibitively expensive, costing up to £45,000 each.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailUnder new plans, pending consultation, people would be allowed to buy shares of\u0026nbsptheir house one per cent at a time.But critics warned administrative costs involved in purchasing further shares\u0026nbsp– such as legal, mortgage arrangement and\u0026nbspvaluation fees\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspcould render\u0026nbspthe proposal\u0026nbsp”unworkable”.The\u0026nbspMHCLG\u0026nbspsaid it wants to make buying smaller chunks a simple, quick process that bypasses the current costly and sometimes lengthy valuations system and will explore the best way to achieve this.Pedzai fears deportation back to Zimbabwe after almost five year waitMr Jenrick\u0027s department\u0026nbspalso announced it had closed a loophole allowing those using the Help to Buy scheme to take on a 35-year mortgage, which until ths week had been capped at 25 years.This would make mortgage payments more affordable but leave people with greater interest to pay off in the long run.Ms\u0026nbspNeate\u0026nbspinstead urged the government to “get building”.“Pinning his hopes on yet another complicated housing scheme is a worrying start for the new housing secretary,” she said.\u0026nbsp“The government must realise that unworkable schemes, laden down with admin costs, are the wrong priority at any time – and are woefully inadequate when this country is facing the current housing emergency.Homeless people denied access to basic healthcare, finds study“If the new government is serious about getting to grips with our housing crisis then it must follow through on its commitment to get building. That’s why we’re calling for 3 million more social homes over the next 20 years, to give more families the sort of step-up they actually need in life.”The MHCLG also plans to increase\u0026nbspthe number of homes sold at discounted prices to people trying to get onto the property ladder\u0026nbspand help\u0026nbspbuild local support for new developments, Wednesday’s statement said.But homeless\u0026nbspcharity\u0026nbspCentrepoint\u0026nbspsaid the proposed changes would “have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing”.The number of people sleeping rough in England has\u0026nbspskyrocketed by 165 per cent in the last eight years, with a homeless person dying every 19 hours\u0026nbspin the UK, data from the Museum of Homelessness suggests.Centrepoint’s head of\u0026nbspmedia and\u0026nbsppublic\u0026nbspaffairs Paul Noblet said in light of increases in debt and the cost of rent, he welcomed any move by government to make home ownership more affordable.“However, for the homeless young people Centrepoint supports, home ownership is not always a realistic or practical option – so the proposed changes will have little impact on the most vulnerable people in need of housing,” he said.“To ensure that everyone can have a place to call home the government must ensure it focuses financial resources as much on increasing the supply of social housing as it does on home ownership.”Mr Jenrick, 37, described his first major policy announcement as “radical”, saying: “Building the houses this country needs is a central priority of this government.“We know that most people still want to own their own home, but for many the dream seems a remote one.\u0026nbspMy mission is to increase the number of homes that are being delivered and to get more young people and families onto the housing ladder, particularly those on lower incomes.“That’s why I am announcing radical changes to shared ownership so we can make it simpler and easier for tens of thousands trying to buy own their own home.”Homeless man dies and second fighting for life after ‘arson attack’Building more homes won’t solve UK housing crisis, new report arguesWhy has Brexit sparked a mini boom in the housing market? But Ms Neate suggested the government could learn from other countries to address the crisis.She referred to schemes in Norway, in which people pay into a housing cooperative rather than making payments on their inidual home to a housing association. This scheme negates some of the costs associated with purchasing new shares.The MHCLG proposals underline Mr\u0026nbspJohnson’s\u0026nbspdesire to shift from Theresa May’s focus on improving renters rights, to increase home ownership and give young people “a\u0026nbspstake in society, the ability to own at least a share of their home”.While Mr\u0026nbspJohnson has stated an intention to build 300,000 new homes a year and make use of brownfield sites – former industrial or commercial lots – none of Wednesday’s\u0026nbsppolicy proposals referred to the building of new\u0026nbsphouses.A spokesperson for Labour’s shadow minister for housing said if homes aren’t being built, it doesn’t matter how large\u0026nbspa proposed discount is.Shadow housing minister Sarah Jones said: “Tinkering with the details of shared ownership is meaningless when lack of investment from government means low cost homes for ownership simply aren’t getting built.\u0026nbspThe Tories have failed to deliver the low-cost homes we need to get people on the housing ladder.”Just one\u0026nbspper cent\u0026nbspof all homeowners have accessed shared ownership, while the number\u0026nbspof these and other low-cost homes being built each year has almost halved since its peak in 20078, when 200,000 new homes were built.However, director of policy and research at the National Housing Federation, Catherine Ryder, said: “We very much welcome the news that the government is looking at ways to make staircasing in shared ownership easier.\u0026nbsp“Shared ownership is the best route into home ownership for people who can’t afford to buy outright and housing associations, who built 14,000 shared ownership homes last year, are committed to working with the government to continue improving it.”The MHCLG has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesFollowing a Which? complaint in 2015, the government published new guidance to make sure retailers’ pricing practices comply with consumer law. The rules state that information presented to consumers must be fair, must not waste time or cause disappointment, and should not lead buyers to overspend.“Four years on from our super-complaint on misleading pricing practices, many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers,” said Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?.“These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals and spurious special offers.”Which? will report its findings to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and Ms Hitchins urged the CMA to intervene if necessary.Only two of the supermarkets responded to Which? when presented with the findings. Iceland said it will review its promotional calendar, while Asda disagreed with the suggestion that its offers are misleading.“While most of the deals we monitored did represent good value, we spotted 65 instances across the year of supermarkets using misleading discounts that didn’t represent the bargains they claimed.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.What other election pledge would save nearly every British household £. a year No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public deserve to hear from him, too.

But binning the toxic Irish backstop might not be enough eventhe EU agrees.There is plenty in Theresa May’s deal to bind our hands even after we have left.The Sun would still prefer a deal. But Farage will capitalise, understandably so,Boris signs away any sovereign powers in haste to get Brexit over the line. That could yet cost him power.This may all be moot. We do not see Brussels nor the Irish PM scrapping the backstop they have treated as holy writ.But when his own allies like Iain Duncan Smith warn him not to be satisfied solely with that, Boris must listen.WHO’S up for more years of bitter Brexit ision and political paralysis Not Leavers, who were sick of it long ago and are furious their vote hasn’t been fulfilled. Not the EU, either. Its leaders, Boris says, just want it done now too.But others ARE bent on prolonging the agony indefinitely.

As Boris was arguing, the real barriers to trade are not practical ones — they are taxes and regulations.Remainers continually lecture us on the benefits of free trade with the EU — and they are right to do so. Hardly anyone really wants to leave without a deal. If we do have to take that route it will surely not be long before discussions on a free trade deal recommence.Yet those same Remainers bizarrely retreat in horror when anyone suggests we do a free trade deal with the US. “But we’ll have to eat chlorinated chicken,” they complain, as well as GM “Frankenstein” food.As shown by their failure yesterday to agree on a common course of action to thwart Brexit, Remainers are bumbling along in a state of confusion.But nothing demonstrates this better than their contradictory approach to free trade. They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Thanks to the Remain lobby’s endless infighting and self-indulgent argument over who it would like as a caretaker Prime Minister, that is exactly what is overwhelmingly likely to happen on October . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I thought the police would know that [theyd broken into my car] and we’d be on way home.But instead, she was locked up in a rat-infested prison and forced to live next to a cruel mother who had doused her baby in bleach.Every year  Brits are arrested abroad and find themselves in terrying situations, holed up in cells, without lawyers, at the whim of a foreign police force and scared for their lives.In tonights episode of Channel  series Young, Dumb and Locked up in the Sun, Kaylee and two other young Brits tell their stories. Kaylee Carson’s decision to go on a short break to France was completely spontaneous and great fun – at the start. “My cousin said she needed tobacco and I said, ‘Let’s go to France and get you some – it’s cheaper,’” recalls Kaylee, who lives in Peterborough. “It was a four-hour drive to Dover. We got on the ferry straight away.It was boiling hot weather and we were standing at the front, breeze blowing in our hair, re-enacting Titanic! It was really nice.”After a lovely day spent sightseeing in Calais and buying cigarettes, they missed their ferry back but bought aticket from Dunkirk for am the following morning, booking a night in a hotel.When they went through security at the docks the next morning, a guard asked Kaylee to open her boot. She thought nothing of it - but under when she lted the lid she was horried.“My face dropped,” says Kaylee. “There was a family of three in there with a blanket wrapped around them and bags and bags of clothes. I guess they were trying to escape. I said, Get them out of my car, why are you in my car ”Kaylee was in shock and presumed they’d jumped into the boot when they were sleeping at the hotel.“I tried not to panic. I thought the police would know that and that soon we’d be on our way home,” says Kaylee.But it wasnt that easy.The pair were handcuffed and taken to a cell at the ferry port for questioning. “They said you’re lying to us,” says Kaylee. “They thought we’d set it up or real smugglers had asked us to do this. They were telling us we’re going to jail.”The penalty for human trafficking in France is up to  years in prison and a fine of up to £.million.“We begged them and pleaded and cried,” says Kaylee. “We told them we’ve got babies at home and jobs to go to.”But it made no dference. After a week spent in custody, Kaylee and her cousin were summonsed to court. They were told they were going to be kept on remand in prison while the investigation continued and the pair were transferred to a French jail in Lille. “It was quite scary, there was a lot of shouting,” says Kaylee. “The screw wasn’t soft, she was quite pushy and pushed you here, pushed you there. I wanted to turn around and smack her - it was surreal. They told us we were the only English girls in jail and we could stay together. It was really dirty. There were rats running around everywhere.”For  hours a day the pair were kept locked up in the cell, only allowed a half an hour break in the exercise yard in the morning and afternoon.Their fellow inmates were a nightmare. “We didn’t feel safe at all,” says Kaylee. “One of our glasses smashed and we kept a bit in our bra as it felt a bit safer.In one room one woman was screaming and shouting because she was in a bad mood and it went on all day, all night - it was awful.Then they put a girl next to us who had a baby with a black guy and she’d thrown bleach on the baby to try and turn the baby white. I was just disgusted that they put her near us and we banged on her wall all night and they moved her away.“I lost three stone, most of my baby weight,” says Kaylee. “But my cousin drove me crazy – anyone wouldyou were with them  hours a day.”Kaylee and her cousin were were convinced the “screws” were anti-British and messed with their heads, often banging on their doors in the middle of the night just to wake them up and once even turning off the water for  hours in their cell.Every day they woke up in hope and finally, after three months, they were asked to sign some paperwork and told to pack their stuff. They were released without charge and deported from France. “There was such excitement to see my daughter and to see my family and friends,” says Kaylee. “It was surreal, going onto the plane. I said, “give me a beer!” It felt like forever but it could have been so much worse. No more tobacco runs.”Huddersfield painter and decorator Robert Kaskovich had been on holiday to Thailand over a dozen times and loved it.“Going so many times over the years, I’d heard the stories of people being locked up but I’d never had one bit of trouble before this trip,” says Robert.Robert met James, his old mate from home, and the pair went south to the idyllic holiday island of Phuket with one plan: to drink and meet girls.“I’d come out of a relationship, he was single. It was just two lads going out, trying to pull women, having a laugh with them and meeting lots of people,” says Robert.They went to the infamous Bangla Road area of Phuket where the roads were lined with strip clubs, go go bars and nightclubs. Robert met an English girl who was living out there and he took her to get some food. When he saw someone’s scooter blocking in another scooter he made the fateful decision of going over to move it.“The next thing I know police are tapping me on the shoulder asking me what I was doing,” says Robert, describing the moment his evening – and his holiday – went pear-shaped.The Thai police asked him to breathe into a breathalyser and being way over the limit they put him in the back of their car. Thailand has a zero tolerance policy on drink driving andconvicted the penalty is up to  years in jail and a £, fine.Robert was driven back to the station, where the police told him he’d spend a night in the cell then go to court the following morning. “They took my belt and phone off me and nothing was said whatsoever,” says Robert. “One minute I’m partying and the next I’m in a police cell with  other Thai people. I’d done nothing wrong. I was terried.  The cell was three by four metres long, there was one toilet in it, ants were running across the floor, stinking of s*** and p***, with no pillows.”A fellow Dutch inmate told him he’d either be moved to another prison or would have to pay to get out.Three days later, an officer starting talking to him about money, saying it would cost Robert , Baht - about £ - to get an early release.But Robert said no and he was transferred to another prison, this time caged with hard-nosed criminals.“One had a ball and chain on his ankles which told me he was a killer or a big drug dealer,” says Robert. “He was very intimidating to look at and I stayed in the opposite corner to him. No one offered you water. There was two meals a day, rice with the driest egg ever and I couldn’t eat it. I was starving in a cell, everyone’s p***ing and s****ing in front of each other and I didn’t know how I was going to get out.”After seven days banged up, Robert received a visit from the tourist police who negotiated his release for , Baht  - £ - with the commissioner. After signing  Thai documents, Robert was released on condition he ed to court the next day.“I drank, and drank and had the best night. It was the most drunk I’ve ever been in Thailand and I didn’t get in till am,” says Robert.Welsh builder Aaron Hughes was an adrenaline junkie who was banged up in Las Vegas after swimming across a dangerous dam.Away on a stag do, Aaron and his mates  started drinking on the plane over there and had been drinking  for  hours straight by the time they went to visit the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam – a concrete  metre tall dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River.“I’d never heard it before,’ says Arron. “ We had a case of beer in the back of the car and it was roasting -  degrees. We were waving at everyone on the highway. We were buzzing.”When they got to the Dam, Arron made a decision which he didn’t realise was both illegal and le-threatening.“I looked at the sheer size of the wall and I made a split second decision I was going to swim the dam,” he recalls. “I was looking up at the wall - it was crazy. I hadn’t a care in the world and was wonderingI could get to the other side. I was doing a bit of backstroke, everything, trying to get across. My friends were looking down, taking pictures.” Arron was in the water for over half an hour and was exhausted when he came out.“I didn’t think anything of the legality of it,” he says. “It was only when I saw the police. I thought it wasn’t that bad – all I did was have a little swim.”But it’s against the law to swim within  yards of dams in the USA - and doing so carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.When he climbed out – still in his shoes and shorts – Arron was arrested. “I thought, “S*** here we go, we’re getting arrested in Vegas  - not a good start to the holiday.”They took him to a holding cell there where he started to panic about what was going to happen. Then eventually, two officers walked in and said to Arron, “That was f***ing awesome” and shook his hand.  “I couldn’t get my head around it,” says Arron. “ people had died doing what I’d done and they’d never seen anyone survive doing that.”Incredibly for Arron, it was a beautul, cloudless day and only one turbine in the dam was on out of . Any cloud cover over the solar dishes and up to  turbines would have been on and the swirl of the water would have swallowed him whole. “Someone was looking after me that day,” says Arron.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to reports, the Prime Minister and his team at Number  were determined to keep their plans a secret until everything was done and dusted - but things didnapost quite go as they hoped. Three of Johnsonaposs ministers - Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg , Lords Leader Baroness Natalie Evans and Chief Whip Mark Spencer - were sent to Balmoral to ask the Queen to suspend Parliament. However a leak, believed to have come from within Whitehall, meant word of their plans got out much earlier than planned.    According to the Times, this means Johnson had to bring his phone call with the Queen forward to tell her what he was planning so she didnapost read it in the news first.  The Times states: To the embarrassment of Downing Street, Boris Johnson had to bring forward a phone call to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue Parliament so that she would know about it before the rest of the nation heard it on the news. However Number  has refused to confirm what time the phone call happened. The Monarch signed off the shock bid - which has prompted outrage among MPs and plunged Britain into a constitutional crisis - in the meeting at her summer retreat Balmoral.    It means Parliament will be suspended or aposproroguedapos for more than a month from September , sabotaging MPsapos efforts to block no-deal Brexit or vote no confidence in the government. According to Jacob Rees-Mogg , the Queen did not question Johnsonaposs request to shut down Parliament - and realistically would not have been able to. He said there was no chat, no debate after he flew to Balmoral to make the request, saying: The Queen says aposapprovedapos. That’s it. Some suggested the Queen should have blocked the aposprorogationapos, however she isnapost technically allowed to.  Royal expert Ingrid Seward, editor in chief of Majesty magazine, believes the Queen may not be happy about what she was forced to do , but knows she has to be above politics. She said: Her Majesty is in an uncomfortable position. As Head of State she acts for the Government of the day. That is her job. The constitution is working exactly as it should.  It is not a crisis as many people have said, but it is a very dficult chapter in the history of the constitution which was set by statue as a Bill of Rights in .  Having reigned for over  years, Her Majesty is sensitive to the wishes of her people and knows over this issue the nation is seriously ided.  She may not be happy and she may well be troubled by the latest turn of events. But she is above politics and always has been. Those close to Her Majesty say how much she dislikes being dragged into a potentially political minefield.  She has spent her time as Queen avoiding doing so.

Boris Johnson claimed the decision was so he could hold a Queenaposs Speech - and allies claim itaposs nothing to do with railroading through no-deal.But Mr Clarke said: We’re being told blatant lies. How on earth they can keep a straight face saying it isn’t designed to frustrate Brexit I don’t know. Remain-backing ex-minister Mr Clarke also vowed to join opposition MPs, who plan to rush legislation through Parliament to block no-deal. Urging Parliament to “act quickly and promptly next week”, he said of the governmentaposs behaviour: “It is totally outrageous.    “It should have the effect of getting the majority of the House of Commons who think a no-deal Brexit would be a calamity actually to get together to agree some compromise between themselves. “Actually decide firmly what they’re going to provide a majority to do. “I hope they will do it in legislation and I hope we will get the time to pass that legislation properly.” Mr Clarke accused the Prime Minster of preparing for a people versus foreigners election and a people versus parliament election. It was Donald Trump-type stuff, he added. “I think nobody expected such outrageous conduct. It’s plainly unconstitutional.    The Queen granted Boris Johnsonaposs request yesterday to prorogue Parliament - suspend it between sessions - from September  to October . It will allow the Prime Minister to lay out a new plan for government in a Queenaposs Speech. But the long break means Parliament will sit for just seven or fewer days from next Tuesday.Despite the tight timescale Labour and other opposition MPs will try to force laws against no-deal through Parliament from next week.And they look set to be joined by Tory Remainers.

But it was DJ Alex Clarke’s first teenage love of mixing tunes in nightclubs which inspired him to create a product range that would overhaul the industry years later. The fully trained joiner set up Fonik Audio Innovations in  after spotting a market gap for well-designed and affordable furniture stands for music production equipment. Now, with orders as far afield as Germany, France and the USA, the future is looking bright for the Bradford-born music producer. He was recently shortlisted in the Top  businesses to be in with a chance of receiving £, Yorkshire Bank prize as part of a Heart competition, giving inspirational small businesses a well-deserved pat on the back.  Alex, , couldn’t believe his ears when he heard the news. “I was amazed,” he says. “It fills me with confidence to know what I’m doing is right and it’s a bit of recognition too.” Alex, who used to DJ in clubs, decided to mody his own mixing desk five years ago after growing weary at having to constantly shuffle his turntable, mixers, keyboard and drum machines around a tiny desk every time he wanted to produce a new sound.  “The stands I make offer an ergonomic solution and make things more practical,” he says.  “I know what it’s like when you’ve been mixing music for hours, leaning over tables and moving equipment around to make space. After a while, you just give up because you’re uncomfortable and your back is aching.  “It makes such a big dferenceyou’re comfortable, with things at the right height, set out in logical order - and that really shows in the music you produce.” In the  months Fonik has been trading, it has already grown from strength to strength, taking on a young apprentice and teaming up with a city centre music tech shop to showcase its designs and grow its customer base.  “The stands have proved really popular, and we’re even manufacturing for distributors in Europe and the USA,” says Alex. “It means long days as I have to stay up late to communicate with them due to the time dference, but nothing good comes easy. I know I’m so lucky being able to combine my passion for music with my  years of joinery skills, but I think it’s because I’ve experienced what it’s like, and I recognise how I can make a dference.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple who spent four years","story":"NewsCouple who spent four years trying for a baby devastated after son dies at  days oldWARNING - UPSETTING IMAGES: Ria Constable and partner Aaron Marks were told their newborn son had two extremely rare heart defects which meant were unable to hold him before he was rushed emergency treatmentShareCommentsByKieran Murray:,  AUG NewsParents Ria Constable and Aaron Marks with their baby boy Leo at the Freeman Hospital \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Ria Constable and partner Aaron Marks were over the moon when they finally discovered that they were expecting a new arrival. The young couple couldnapost wait to meet their baby boy and were excited to start a new chapter of their lives.But their world was turned upside down during the pregnancy after discovering their son was going to be born with an extremely rare condition.Doctors confirmed their first child had both hypoplastic left heart syndrome- a birth defect that affects normal blood flow through the heart - and an a trial septal defect , a hole between the two small chambers of the heart.    Ria, , said: Everything was fine from the private -week scan and at the scan at  weeks we were told he was growing great. Then to be told that Leo had these conditions which were so rare we were just in shock. That day our world broke. It was hard to think that we werenapost going to be able to hold Leo when he was born. We just kept being positive and hoping everything would be fine. Requiring immediate surgery at birth, Leo was one of the only babies to be born at the Freeman Hospital via c-section on August  with a full team travelling from the Royal Victoria Infirmary to deliver him. It meant the Newbiggin Hall parents were unable to hold their baby before being whisked off for emergency treatment. It was like he wasnapost actually born, said Ria. It just didnapost feel right. We had to wait seven and a half hours before we got to see him. Despite the surgery being a success, just six days later doctors suspected Leoaposs condition was more uncommon than anticipated with him also believed to have had a lung condition called congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia.    This, however, was not able to be confirmed due to a Leo not being strong enough for a biopsy to be taken. Ria said: This made Leoaposs case even rarer and our perfect little boy was one of  cases in the world from what we saw online. We read that both conditions are not usually compatible in le. It was on August  when they were told the devastating news that no parent wants to hear - that there was no more doctors could do to save their son. We didnapost speak much in the meeting because I donapost think we knew how to react, said Ria. It wasnapost until we were left alone when we broke down in tears. By that moment it hit us and we knew we werenapost going to be taking our baby boy home. This was heartbreaking news for us as parents and as people who had fought for so long through infertility and IVF to bring our boy into the world and to have to let him go so soon. Tesco workers Ria and Aaron spent the day making special memories with Leo, including holding him for the very first time, before saying their final goodbyes. Ria said: We washed him, dressed him and held him - the things you take for granted. It was the first time that we felt like parents. It was the best and the worst day at the same time.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids George, Charlotte and Louis, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the York sisters all pop in to stay with the Queen and Philip during their holidays - making it a very busy time for them.But what exactly do the royals get up to during their Scottish break   Speaking on ITVaposs documentary Our Queen at  Eugenie said: Itaposs the most beautul place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there, I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, thereaposs always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise weaposre all there, so itaposs a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run. But according to an insider, itaposs not almost the most relaxing break and things can be pretty hectic. They told Vanity Fair: “It can get quite busy at what they call ‘the big house’ and it’s not especially relaxing even though it’s a holiday.    “There’s a daily routine which evolves around meal times, several outfit changes every day, sometimes five, and the Queen likes everything to run like clockwork. The focus is on being outdoors and in the countryside walking, grousing, fishing and hunting.” Balmoral is a working estate with highlights including grouse moors, the lush green forests and farmland, as well as plenty of animals from the herds of deer to Highland cattle and ponies. The Royals love grouse hunting, and go out regularly during their time at the castle.    Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch.But itaposs bad news for the family this year as the Queen has been forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season as there has been a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather . Photographer Milton Gendel said he was invited to Balmoral back in  , and opened up about the experience to  Vanity Fair  .   He wrote: On some days there were excursions into the country. The Queen had been taught to drive by auxiliary army officers during World War II, and she handled a Land Rover with intrepid skill on the hilly and winding roads. When we went riding, she saddled her horse, and afterward carried the saddle back to the stable herself. At a shoot on the grounds a truck delivered a sumptuous buffet lunch.

When flooding ruined Margaret Loveaposs kitchen she decided to take the plunge and splash out on a new one at a Magnet showroom in Gosforth. Margaret, of Denton Burn, in Newcastle says she was told it would take  days for the work to be carried out.But almost two weeks after when it should have been completed sheaposs been left with a half finished kitchen, report ChronicleLive.   And the stress has been so much sheaposs collapsed - and had to be revived by her first-aider daughter. Magnet say the issues are not directly linked to them - and lie with an independent contractor. She said: I have got parts of the kitchen units installed, but not completed. I went to Magnet because they had a good reputation for bespoke kitchens. The fitter walked off the job and this is how it has been left by Magnet.  It was supposed to be completed by a set deadline within a two weeks period, work started on July  and there is still no finalised date for it to be completed. Until last Friday, I had no facilities and had nowhere to wash our dishes and cups. I have had to rinse them in the bath. I have had to have appliances redelivered more than once because I was told theyaposd be able to be installed.  As a result, Margaret says she has had to live with boxes of kitchen items throughout her house. She said: I had  items delivered for the kitchen. All my living things, such pots and pans are living room and bedroom areas and there is no space to live in. I canapost get in my garage, which is packed with items for the kitchen items. The floor had to be re-levelled but it wasnapost done right, so I have had to pay thousands of pounds for an independent builder to do the work.  I paid for a breakfast bar - they donapost know where that is. I have the legs for it, but not the bar. I had to buy a picnic table because I was having friends over and didnapost have anywhere to eat. New items that have been fitted have also been ruined, she said. My new sink unit has been damaged, I had a new boiler cabinet made but that was blocked in so I had to have that removed, she said.  I have no doors or toilet door and the toilet is filled with boxes. The fiasco has had a detrimental impact on Margaretaposs health, she said. Every time I speak to someone they are either away or holiday, she said. I collapsed on Sunday because of the stress because my heart rate went funny. I was out for a few minutes, luckily my daughter is trained first aider.  A spokesperson from Magnet said it was a complex case because a lot of the customer concerns raised involve additional works contracted independently and aren’t related to Magnet. They added: The list supplied by the customer isn’t an indication of poor work, it shows a list of what’s not been completed “Having said that, we want to make sure all our customers receive the highest level of service, which is partly how we were awarded the number one spot within the recent Which  guide to kitchens.

Leo the dog scuffles across the floor, maybe wondering when the normal Tuesday evening bustle of cooking tea, and watching Love Island, will begin. It’ll be an hour or so. Dave Bush, we Sue, and daughter Jess, have suspended family le, as they do once or twice a week, to simultaneously chat, via text messages, to complete strangers. Beneath the hush, there’s a lot of noise – fraught words tumbling out in -character snippets strung together in anxious streams, which need every ounce of their attention. As we sit here drinking tea, two of those strangers texting Sue and Jess are revealing they are suicidal.  Sue is chatting to a school-age teenager. “They are struggling, they have been self-harming, they’ve mentioned bullying, and they’ve said they feel suicidal,” she relays, hurriedly looking up for a second as she waits for a reply. Sitting next to her, Jess explains: “My person’s introductory message said they were suicidal. They have a plan, they say they also have the means, but an idea of timeframe isn’t clear yet.” She’s waiting for a reply to tell herit’s tonight. They tell me this situation is far from rare. “It’s a reasonably common conversation to have,” Sue says. “Especially in the evening.” This is Shout, the UK’s first free   text service open to anyone in crisis, run by Mental Health Innovations, and launched in May by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a means to tackle Britain’s mental health crisis. And crisis it is, according to the figures. In its pilot year, Shout, which has , UK volunteers answering texts, handled , conversations. Today, they’re fielding around  a day. Since its official launch in May, it has held more than ,. Of those, % have mentioned suicide, % depression and % self-harm.  While almost half of texters are aged -, disturbingly, % are aged -. Figures from the annual Good Childhood report this week revealed more children aged - saying they are unhappy than at any point in the last  years. The Bushes, from Cheddington, Bucks, are Shout’s only volunteer family. It helps that they can hold conversations side by side, because it’s heavy going. Sue and Dave joined up in December, and Jess in March, and when we meet, they have held over  conversations. I join them at pm on a weekday. Shout’s busiest time is between pm and am but even in this moment there are  conversations unfolding, plus a queue of four people waiting. When users first text, a complex algorithm assessesthey are high risk. Shout’s volunteers, who have undergone  to  hours of training, are monitored by remote supervisors. Sue, , who works in business development, plucks her school-age teen from the queue, but they take a while to respond to her.  Because they’ve mentioned suicide, she needs to risk assess them, and the wait for a reply is an anxious one. At the sound of a ping she snaps back to her screen. “We have the volume set loud,” she apologises. Meanwhile, Dave, , an actuary, has started chatting. His text is from a young woman struggling as counselling she has been having has ended. But it’s accountant Jess, , who’s found herself confronted with the most immediately challenging situation. Her texter has said they are suicidal right now. The risk assessment has stages, including discovering whether the texter has a plan for suicide, and the means, such as pills or razor blades, whether they have that means with them, and how soon they plan to act. They eventually reply they want to talk to someone about their feelings – a service Shout doesn’t provide. “I have suggested the Samaritans,” says Jess, now waiting anxiously to hearthe texter has called them.

Daniel Williams was not a regular drinker and he usually the one helping others to find their way home whenthey had drunk a bit too much, the coroner heard. Tragically there was nobody to take the -year-old home on a night when he appeared like a zombie, having consumed two-and-half times the drink-drive limit at the University of Readingaposs student bar. Mr Williams, known to friends as Dan, attempted to make his way home alone through five inches of fresh snow in the early hours of January . He had become separated from his friends but in his drunken state he accidentally plunged into the icy waters of the Whiteknights lake in Reading, Berks, the coroner ruled.  He was found following an extensive police search, in which boat crews and dog units were sent out. Scores of officers struggled to break the thick ice on top of the lake, just hundreds of yards away from the student union block, so they could enter the chest-high water. The inquest heard that ironically, Daniel was a leguard. The temperature was -C when they waded through treacle-like silt, searching for the missing student. The search ended days later - on February  - when Danaposs body was found, face down with his lower body submerged in the water and his mobile phone and wallet still in his pockets, the inquest in Reading, Berks, heard.  Heidi Connor, Senior Coroner for Berkshire, told the inquest: It seems to me that the circumstances of Danaposs death are tragic but very clear. On the night of January , he went out with friends, doing what students do around the world: he was enjoying himself, drinking alcohol at the student club. He came late in le to alcohol. Drinking alcohol when you are not used to drinking alcohol can have a more dramatic effect, she said. The inquest heard evidence from William Collins, who was one of three other young men who lived with Daniel in their student lodgings near to the university. Mr Collins told the inquest how the four housemates had decided on a night out together on January  and had left their home at pm. He said Daniel, who was wearing a dark-coloured hooded top, had been with him in the Cheese Room, the main dance floor in the newly-refurbished sixty nightclub and bar during the weekly Wednesday Union night. Daniel had ordered four Jagerbombs, a mixture of Jagermeister and an energy drink, for himself, the inquest heard, before he disappeared.  Mr Collins said, in an interview given to police before Daniel was found: It is normal behaviour for Daniel to just go off and leave us during a night and he had done this several times before. We did not see him again. The second year computer sciences student, rom Sutton, Surrey, was later seen by another student, Rebecca Jones. She saw him standing near to the front of the dance floor in the Cheese Room and clinging onto a railing in front of the DJ. Ms Jones said: I saw he was very blank in his face, ashe was staring at us. It appeared ashe was a zombie andyou jumped at him he would not have moved. Nobody saw Daniel leave the student bar and by the evening of January , his housemates had become so concerned they contacted the police and reported him as missing. Detective Constable Andy Matheson, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest police had upgraded Mr Williams to a high-risk missing person after failing to find him during an overnight search. He told the inquest police had established Mr Williams had left the student bar at .am, as his phone had disconnected from the unionaposs Wi-Fi network and his phone had stopped receiving any signal at .am.  Det. Con. Matheson said: I donapost think anything can be read into that as to when Dan entered the lake.The phone still ed when it came out of the lake. It is possible it [the phone] could still have been connected to the network while it was submerged in the water. Danielaposs parents organised a huge leaflet drop around the university area, appealing for any information about the whereabouts of the blond-haired, blue-eyed student. Volunteers from the local Lowland Search Team also took part in picking through bushes and undergrowth in the hope of finding Daniel and crews from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service used their fire boat and waders to search in the lake, three times without success. Police Constable Al Mathieson, leading the search on the ground, said the conditions at the lake, which was not especially deep but was frozen solid and surrounded by a thick layer of silt, meant the focus of the search was on the bank of the lake. Mr Williams was found just shy of an island, which is about  metres from the bank of the lake and the inquest heard the joint investigations of the police and the coroneraposs office discovered there was no sign of any third party involvement, nor any indication that Daniel had been planning to take his own le.  Mrs Connor told his family, who attended the inquest, the young student had no drugs in his system but did have mg of alcohol per ml of blood, two-and-a-half times the drink-driving limit. The coroner said: He did have a relatively high blood alcohol level. In this line of work, I have seen worse than this, but it is undoubtedly high. A post mortem examination gave the cause of death as drowning while under the influence of alcohol and Mrs Connor suggested to the family Mr Williamsapos death should be ruled as an accident. In response, a woman believed to be Danielaposs mother, told the coroner: Contrary to the findings that he had the alcohol, ironically Dan wasnapost a drinker and I feel he was possibly rather naive. Two-and-a-half times the legal limit for driving is a lot, but as you say, there are people who drink a lot more. He did not drink at all until he was  years old. He was a wonderful son. He was genuine, principled, universally loved and liked by everyone who knew him.Ironically, he worked as a le guard. I feel it is tragic because I do not feel that his death should define him, because we are heartbroken.I just hope he did not suffer. Mrs Connor responded: I doubt there is one person in this room who has not been under the influence of alcohol at some point in their le. It certainly does not define Daniel in any way, shape or form.It is just so very sad that this was the outcome in Danaposs case.

Marine ecologist Charlotte Young, from Pembrokeshire and boyfriend George Chislett, spotted the giant female turtle struggling to make her way back from laying eggs. And as they went closer, they found the sea creature was completely trapped in between two giant rocks just inches away from the sea. Charlotte recalled the incident, which happened on July , and said: We got up bright and early and we wandered down to the beach.    And George is filming all of the ghost crabs that are crawling about on the beach. As Iaposm scanning the horizon, I realise something odd. I realise that this turtle is kind of up on its side. We notice that her flipper is bloodied because she has been trying, obviously to free herself. They spent a fruitless -minute rescue attempt and were thinking to give up at one point. George explained: Those sort of jaggedy edges of the rock were dug into both sides of her shell. We tried for the best part of  minutes, to lt her. Footage posted onto Facebook shows the turtle desperately moving its flippers while the couple tries to lt her up - but its bottom is firmly stuck no matter how hard they try.Luckily Charlotte found a wooden plank and suggested using it to lever the giant turtle to the safety area of the sea in the Ras Al-Jinz area. We were able to get the plank under her, and with the first push, we moved her those couple of first centimetres, which was the first progress that we had made, Charlotte said. And that was the moment that we knew we were gonna get her out!    As Charlotte pushes with the wooden plank, George is seen lting her up to the sand. The turtle is also seen moving its flippers forward in hopes to break free from the rocks. The dedicated couple smiled in relief as the turtle makes her way back into the sea. Charlotte cheered: We did it, oh my God! Go on baby! Go be free!

Rachel de Rond, , from Haarlem, The Netherlands, was born with natural curls that lost their bounce over time as she became older. In her early twenties she would use shampoo every two days, but when the quality of her hair deteriorated, she dropped that to once a week. This improved her hair slightly, so in August  she discovered the aposno pooapos method, washing hair with a gentle alternative to shampoo, such as apple cider vinegar or water only. Since abandoning the shampoo and other synthetic hair products, she has noticed a considerable dference in the quality of her hair, which has become curlier and more volumized.    She now uses a solution made up of ground nuts and leaves from trees and plants called ayurvedic herbs which she leaves in her hair for  minutes, then rinses out with tap water.Four days later she refreshes her curls with rainwater, which she collects and adds a tiny bit of flaxseed gel on her wet curls. A year after discarding her shampoo bottles, her boyfriend Max van Kessel, , followed her lead hasnapost used shampoo or any product since either.He is now following the water only method.  Rachel says while she was initially worried she would be accused of being aposdirtyapos, she has received a positive response.Strangers love her new hair and they even questionshe has styled her hair with curlers. She said: My scalp didnapost like shampoo and was telling me to stop. Shampoo contains sulphates, which clean everythingand they are very strong and can dry out your skin and hair. I learned about the no-shampoo method because I read an article about a girl who didnapost wash her hair for six to eight weeks when she was on a holiday.  First her hair became quite greasy, but after a few weeks it normalised and in the end her hair was so soft and bouncy. It didnapost look greasy at all. If you saw her, you wouldnapost know that she didnapost washed her hair with shampoo.So, I started reading about the no-shampoo method and I talked about it with my colleague.    Following her advice I started with washing with Aleppo soap and rinsing with apple cider vinegar.My hair and scalp loved it. The dry white flakes disappeared, and my curls came back. I stopped using shampoo in August . After three weeks my hair was through the transition period.At that time, I washed with Aleppo soap. After a few weeks I tried the ayurvedic herbs, and I loved the results even more. Despite her new routine taking longer than when she washed her hair with shampoo, she insists that the results are worth it. She has even stopped rinsing her hair with tap water and regularly collects water from the rain due to its softer texture.  Rachel says that on a good washday her hair maintains its curls and she doesnapost have to style her hair for four days at a time. She has since encouraged her boyfriend to try the no shampoo method and he now loves his hair too. I wash my hair once a week with the ayurvedic herbs when I wash my hair, I take my time. I let the Ayurveda herbs settle on my hair for about thirty minutes, she said. After a good washday I donapost have to style my hair for about four days. Then I refresh my curls with rainwater, which I collect, and put a little flaxseed gel on my wet curls. Rainwater is much softer than tap water.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

He was somebody I wanted to be.“As I grew up, it was Ronaldo, then the likes of Gareth Bale.“It’s been a great learning curve when I do go away. I take anything I can from that type of player and try to better myself.”Hedges says it was initially quite surreal to meet someone he’d idolised like Giggs, who was appointed after Chris Coleman departed the Welsh hotseat.With his supreme pedigree as a winger – Giggs won the Premier League  times with the Red Devils, as well as two European Cups over close to  appearances – the boss has gone out of his way to pass on guidance for Hedges to improve his game.Hedges said: “I met him when I first made the squad.“It was quite a surreal experience to meet Ryan Giggs, and to be called into his first squad was a huge honour.“I really like him.“He knows what he wants from his players, especially wingers, and can help you wherever he can and does, which is good.”The Red Army will hope some of Giggs’ knowledge can help Hedges continue to star for both his country and Aberdeen.Hedges scored his first Aberdeen goal – a thumping late winner – in the Premiership-opening - win over Hearts on August .He has made nine appearances for the Dons so far this term and will likely start against Ross County at Pittodrie on Saturday before leaving for Wales duty the next day.In the international squad, he will be joined by the likes of Real Madrid star Gareth Bale, although Juventus and former Arsenal playmaker Aaron Ramsey has withdrawn as he continues his comeback from a hamstring injury.Hedges – who started his senior career at Flint Town United before four years at Swansea City which saw him loaned out to Leyton Orient, Stevenage and Yeovil – is among world-famous names.Bale’s summer on-then-off-again departure from the Bernabeu was global news, while Hedges’ arrival at Pittodrie would’ve barely registered outside of Scotland.However, Hedges says he cannot afford to let himself get “starstruck” by these players when he joins up with Wales, because it would be a distraction from the main aim – turning round a qualying campaign which has brought one win and two losses thus far.The winger said: “Obviously theyare huge names.“But they’re your team-mates, so you can’t be too starstruck by them.“You need to share a pitch with them at the end of the day.“Wales have got a very good group on the whole.“There are no egos and it doesn’t matter who you’re playing for domestically, everyone’s pulling the same weight internationally to try to achieve the same thing.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41448202-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41448202-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41448202-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.41448202-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"taylor impresses reds star","story":"Ryan Hedges says he was impressed with Aberdonian Terry Taylor at Wales’ Algarve training camp in the summer.Taylor, , left the Pittodrie youth set-up for Wolverhampton Wanderers in .The midfielder is skipper of the Under-s at Molineux.He played in the first team’s win over Manchester City in the Premier League Asia Trophy in July.Despite previously featuring at youth level for Scotland, Taylor qualies for Wales through his mother.And winger Hedges says he was impressed by the teen’s ability – ability which has seen him called into the Welsh U contingent for upcoming matches against Belgium and Germany.Hedges said: “In the summer we had a training camp and I met up with Terry.“I just spoke to him about Aberdeen before I moved.

However, it previously had a prime-time slot on BBC.A petition launched urging the BBC to put the -year-old show back on BBC and has been signed by more than , people.The show was a staple of BBC and has been described as a “national treasure” by West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie. The politician said owners of gardens showcased across the region will now miss out on their chance to be in the spotlight.He claims the work of people taking part in projects such as the Voyage of Le garden at Inverbervie Church will no longer be recognised.He said: “Beechgrove is a national treasure which was a milestone in Scottish broadcasting when it began.“It’s still the best window on an important part of our culture. So it is deeply unfortunate the coverage is not what it once was.“Brighter Bervie and lots of other green-fingered community groups across the north-east do wonders for their towns and villages – all volunteer-led.“I agree with the gardeners here that Scottish gardening needs sunlight to develop. It’s a fun, outdoor activity which promotes physical and mental health.“So it’s a shame that places like Bervie won’t have the exposure they deserve. Some of the BBC’s best and most watched original programming comes from normal people and their stories.And lots of it stems from this area – the Mart, Trawlermen, lots of Countryfile specials – it’s a fair list.”Veteran TV gardening guru Jim McColl, who first appeared in Beechgrove Garden in  and retired in April, accused the BBC of betraying fans of the show in July. A spokeswoman for BBC Scotland said: “Beechgrove is enjoyed by viewers throughout the UK, who can watch the series when it goes out on network BBC Two on Sundays, and it is also available across the UK on BBC iPlayer.“This series, which features gardens from across Scotland, is one of a number on the BBC Scotland channel featuring people’s stories from the north-east including Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, which is currently on air, and Fish Town, set in Peterhead, which has been available to view across the UK on BBC iplayer.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"produce celebrated at tayvallich flower show","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowProduce and home industries were celebrated at Tayvallich Flower Show where tables groaned under the weight of fruit, flowers, vegetables, preserves and home baking.The natural bounty around Tayvallich Village Hall on Wednesday August  was complemented by walls adorned with photographs and artwork.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows. I#ll talk to anyone about this.#But what can ordinary people do Ruth is quite clear. #Get out there and talk to each other, spread the word on social media, speak to politicians.#But most of all support our local farmers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"ardbeg bullock winner at islay cattle sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual show and sale of autumn-born suckled calves at Islay Auction Mart on Friday August .A good show of calves was presented to show judge J Taylor, Easter Octhtermuthil.Winners were: Bullock class:  Ardbeg,  Kilchiaran,  Ardbeg Heer class:  and  Ardbeg Champion calf: Ardbeg bullock which takes the William A Low Trophy Reserve champion: Kilchiaran bullock.Overall, the bullocks sold to an average of £ per head or .p per kilo while the heers levelled out at £ per head or p per kilo.Principal lots and prices: Bullocks: AAx: £ and £– Ballimartin.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"princess-charlotte-start-school-september","story":"Princess Charlotte will start school next month ndash following in the footsteps of big brother Prince George.Charlotte, who celebrated her fourth birthday on May , will become a pupil at Thomasrsquos Battersea in south London, where it is taught that kindness is as important as academic success.The young princess will be joined by her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, as well as George when she begins her school career on Thursday September , Kensington Palace said.Thomasrsquos Battersea, which describes itself as a Christian school, open to children of all faiths, believes in ldquopraise as the greatest motivator.--vw,vw,px, px\"Charlotte will join brother George at the south London school --Parents are told their children will be in an atmosphere which seeks positive relationships between pupils, teachers and parents.George, who is six, started at the school in September .Art, ballet, drama, ICT, French, music and physical education are all taught by specialist teachers from a childrsquos first day.The school is housed in a Grade II listed building, the former Sir Walter St Johnrsquos Grammar School which dates back to .--vw,vw,px, px\"George holding hands with William and Helen Haslem, head of the lower school, on his first day at Thomasrsquos Battersea in  --American TV presenter Lara Spencer had to apologise after comments she made about George taking ballet lessons sparked a social media backlash.

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"archbishop-justin-welby-financiers-39-moral-duty-39-consider-climate-change-making-investment-decisions","story":"The Most Reverend Justin Welby, recorded a video to appeal directly to fund managers and other investors to help avert the climate crisis ahead of a global summit on ethical finance.He said they could all do something to make a dference.Archbishop Welby said he was concerned that the investment community has lsquonot sufficiently stepped up to the platersquo, and insisted it was within their power to help avert the disastrous consequencesrsquo of failing to achieve the Paris climate change goals.He recorded a video address for the Global Ethical Finance Initiativebefore bringing his message to Scotland at this autumnrsquos world summit on ethical finance in Edinburgh which will see global leaders in business, politics, banking and investment gather to shape a fairer finance system.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Archbishop Justin Welby\",\"description\": \"video by Herald and Times group\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs nIPmonj-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests nIPmonj.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The summit on October th and th is supported by the Scottish Government, and bodies represented will include the United Nations, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, RBS, Baillie Gford and HSBC.

Formally, prorogation is a matter for the Queen but she iniably acts on the advice of her Prime Minister and it would have been unprecedented in modern times for the monarch to decline the Prime Ministerrsquos request. The consequence is that Parliament has no constitutional authority, during the prorogation, to make laws or to hold debates.As with everything Brexit-related, context is all. While prorogation is ordinarily uncontroversial, this suspension of Parliament signicantly reduces the number of parliamentary sitting days available prior to  October, limiting the potential for parliamentary action against a no-deal Brexit. It remains to be seen how MPs respond during next weekrsquos sitting of Parliament, including whether that response includes a vote of no confidence in the Government. It also remains to be seen whether the Court of Session judicial review being pursued by a number of MPs in an attempt to prevent prorogation will now go ahead on  September as planned, whether it will be expedited or indeed, abandoned.House of Commons Speaker John Bercow called the Governmentrsquos plans a ldquoconstitutional outrage and there has been talk of forming an lsquoalternative parliamentrsquo in the case of prorogation.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Mr Leonard last night said that he and Mr Corbyn had reached an accord on the issue. He said: “Jeremy and I have agreed that, during the formative years of an incoming Labour government, we would not sanction a Section  order to allow a further referendum on Scottish independence to take place.”He added: “It would also only be acceptable to a Labour government to allow a second referendum to proceedit could be demonstrated that there was a fresh mandate for such a vote to be held. “This would require a democratic mandate from the people of Scotland, which clearly signals the majority of people are in favour of a new vote.“I do not believe that the conditions exist for such a move today, nor will they for the foreseeable future. Instead I challenge the current Scottish Government to focus on the powers they already have and the ones that could readily be provided to the Parliament at Holyrood, to enable more decisions for Scotland to be made in Scotland.”The deal was revealed in a day which was notable for the constitutional crisis surrounding the suspension of the House of Commons by Boris Johnson and as Mr Corbyn prepared for a visit to Dunfermline today.Mr Leonard said that the priorities for an incoming Labour government would be to deal “first and foremost with the chaos of Brexit” and “to turn round a failing economy rather than usher in a second independence referendum. The current constitutional settlement should be respected and the issues that affect people across Scotland should be the focus of the Labour government at Westminster. “I would hope that Nicola Sturgeon, or any future SNP leader, would recognise that investing in Scotland and repairing a decade of Tory damage would and must be the priority of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Prime Minister, and that the SNP’s obsession with separation would be well down the list of priorities.”Mr Corbyn said independence was not the answer to a Johnson government as it would “prolong and intensy austerity”.

He is being represented by Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston.BBC Radio Shetland#s John Johnston is hosting the event, with all eight candidates being given a minute to introduce themselves and their policies before moving on to audience questions.Independent candidate Ian Scott provided an impassioned speech, saying that he has #stood specically steadfastly against the cuts, the Tories, the Liberal Democrats” before. He also reacted angrily to the news that Mr Goodlad could not be in attendance, shaking his head as Mr Halcro Johnston explained his absence.SNP candidate Tom Wills began by saying that #Shetland is ready for a change# and asked for  months to show what he can achieve in Holyrood, while Lib Dem competitor Beatrice Wishart opened her speech with a defiant message: #If you want an MSP who will speak up for Shetland, I’m your woman#.The first question of the night revolved around transport, with Ms Wishart and Mr Wills clashing immediately, interrupting each other#s answers as Mr Johnston appealed for both candidates to let the other finish.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to Mr Wills# five-point transport plan by saying that #Tom Wills has a load of great ideas but they won’t be delivered#, while independent candidate Ryan Thomson added that #nothing gets done” because “Shetland is the pawn” in mainland politics.Councillor George Smith directed a question at Mr Wills, asking him how he expected the SIC to afford one of his election pledges, free foot passengers on inter-island ferries.Mr Wills responded to say that this could be paid for #, and when# the Scottish government provided additional funding to the council.Mr Thomson criticised the NorthLink ferries in response to a question about increased capacity on the ferries. He focused his attack on the much-maligned sleeping pods, not for the first time, saying that we had been #lumbered# with these pods and said he was reticent to even call them pods, instead saying #it#s a chair#.#Bigger ships# and #daytime sailings# were potential solutions that Mr Thomson suggested as alternatives.On the subject of Brexit, only Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that he was in favour of Brexit, although he admitted that he voted to remain in the EU.Mr Scott and Mr Wills attacked the coalition of the Tories and the Lib Dems, with Mr Scott saying that the #Tories and Liberals approved austerity and that they had #turned to the racists and the fascists# which garnered wide applause.Mr Halcro Johnston responded to say it was #always very amusing listening to Ian but I’m afraid he’s wrong#, which was met negatively by the audience.Mr Wills said that the SNP #could stop Brexit#, and added thatthey were pulled out of the EU by Westminster then a vote for independence could put Scotland back into the European Union.He expanded on Mr Scott#s point by saying the #reason why people voted for Brexit is because of the coalition of Lib Dems and Tories which approved austerity# to a rapturous reception. Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder. The SNP promote an inclusive civic nationalism which can#t seriously be compared to that of the far right.##and the peril of getting too friendly with the EU is being dictated to and bled dry by a Union of Socialist Republics ruled by a Germanic Franco dictator, aided an abetted by a random collection of Belgians.Best off going it alone and not being shackled up to some #superpower#, either actual or wannabe.John M Scott#s remark reminds me of something a reviewer wrote in the Shetland News in : #The depths of ignorance are surely plumbed here#.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence. Thanks guysYou#ll have to listen tonight folks, there isnt even any mention of VE which was discussedLabour has a position on Brexit!Where did you find out about this Johan @Brian Hill, It is you who fantasise, not I. I did not mention #national debt#. So let#s set aside the #smoke and mirrors#. I am talking about the £. billion gap between Scottish tax revenue raised last year and money received from Westminster. We have been running similar, sometimes larger deficits for many years. Unless something changes this will become our annual budget deficit on obtaining independence as Westminster will no longer fund the shortfall.Don#t take it from me. A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of £. billion equates to around £ per head of population, per year. With independence that money will have to be found where # borrowing or tax hikes # or cut from public services.#John, as Scotland is not yet independent then it cant have been running a deficit for any#, what utter nonsense. Since when did you have to be independent to go broke  Try telling that one to your bank manager. Dr Craig Dalzell! who  wings over Scotland! still based in England, hard to make it up but you manage it Brian.John, I#m sorryit appeared pernickety, but my fundamental point was that you cant predict the future finances of any putative future independent Scotland based on the notionalaccounts of a devolved Scotland within the current UK state. No amount of repetition of thosefigures alters the arguments.Brian,You#re putting words in my mouth. I#m not attempting to predict future finances. Merely, observing that we would start from a very bad place, losing the £. billion annual UK funding.But please, don#t take it from me.The SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission propose a multi-year programme of deficit reduction and Oxford University Professor Gallacher has studied the most recent figures. He concludes: #Any more realistic look……. starting from Scotland’s actual fiscal position, swtly shows…….would quickly amass unsustainable levels of debt, and the cost of servicing it would require large cuts in public services. #….today’s relatively high spending is supported by large UK fiscal transfers, and to avoid cutting it large borrowing would be needed. #That swtly adds up to very large debt, which cannot be afforded. #All this strategy would achieve is to delay the inevitable big cuts in spending until Scotland is heavily indebted and so has to make even more cuts.#Paraphrasing your own words, Brian, #No amount of SNP preication can alter the facts.#I#m no economist by any stretch of the imagination. But could we not use the £bn+ that Westminster uses in defence, HS , bribing the DUP , or building a #national# stadiumon our behalf, to subsidise the #deficit# Those are the more optimistic contentions which I take from the Commission#s report, as to what can be done when an independent Scotland takes full control of its own resourcesAye, Brian, as you say, #those are the more optimistic contentions#from the Commission’s report,…#Here is the summary of the Growth Commission#s analysis for kicking off Indy:Also, they recognise the need for a multi-year deficit reduction plan .#Creating a credible and sustainable fiscal framework  policy:.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College.

no-deal Brexit as “absolutely outrageous”, “extraordinary” and “ridiculous”.She did not comment on the matter when asked about it by the PA news agency on Thursday after she visited a jobs and benefits office in east Belfast.The idea of leaving the EU to take back more control into Parliament and to consider the idea of closing Parliament to do that is the most extraordinary idea Ive ever heardAmber Rudds comments in JuneMs Rudd insisted she was focused on her role.“I’m going to continue to do my job as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,” she said in response to one of a number of questions about the suspension move.In June, Ms Rudd told Sky News: “The idea of leaving the EU to take back more control into Parliament and to consider the idea of closing Parliament to do that is the most extraordinary idea I’ve ever heard.”Ms Rudd’s visit to Northern Ireland was focused on the progress of welfare reforms in the region.It comes ahead of another looming political row over the measures.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An extension of a Stormont mitigation scheme would require the sign-off of ministers A £ million package of Stormont mitigation designed to absorb some of the impact of UK-wide changes to the benefits system is due to expire in March next year.The support payments were introduced as part of the  Stormont House Agreement, ending months of political deadlock over the introduction of welfare reforms in Northern Ireland.Reforms including the benefits cap and so-called bedroom tax were eventually implemented in the region after local politicians agreed those worst impacted would receive additional financial support from Stormont.Any extension of the mitigation scheme from April  onwards would require the sign-off of ministers.With no imminent prospect of aof devolution, the Government is already facing calls to step in to ensure support is protected going forward.After her visit to the Benefits Service Centre, Ms Rudd said: “What I’ve seen today is some really great work being done by the work coaches in Northern Ireland helping people who are vulnerable and helping other people into work, it’s been some really excellent work being done here to help people.“I am here on a visit to work out what’s going on in my department, how people are helping people into work, and what I’ve seen today has been really reassuring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nearly 79000 irish passports issued to uk residents in first six months","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

blocking right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini’s grab for power..pushMr Conte said after meeting with Italian president Sergio Mattarella that he would meet with the parties immediately in a bid to establish political stability as quickly as possible after the crisis triggered by Mr Salvini’s power play that collapsed the -month-old populist government.“This is a very delicate phase for the country,” said Mr Conte, who was forced to resign on August  after Mr Salvini pulled support for his government.“We need to exit political uncertainty as quickly as possible.”Mr Conte said he will work hard to give the country a solid government, adding: “We need to make up for the time we’ve lost to allow Italy to recover its central role in Europe.”This is a very delicate phase for the countryGiuseppe ConteMr Salvini’s move created political instability that once again focused investor attention on Italy, raising borrowing costs on its stubbornly high debt.Italy also faces a critical fall deadline for drafting a budget for the European Union, with the looming prospect of raising the value-added tax to cover shortfalls.The populist -Star Movement and Democrats have banded together in an unlikely alliance together to thwart Mr Salvini’s bungled attempt to grab power when he unexpectedly withdrew support for the foundering League--Star government to seek early elections.The new alliance appears to forestall elections — for now.But evenMr Conte manages to form a government, wins the support of Mr Mattarella and a vote of confidence in parliament, political analysts warn it is unlikely to last.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Designate premier Giuseppe Conte delivers his speech after a meeting with President Sergio Mattarella The Democratic Party refused to even consider talks with the -Stars after the inconclusive March  national elections eventually led to the coalition with the League, and the two parties have long traded barbed insults.Mr Salvini was emboldened to pull the plug on the government by his strong showing in this spring’s European elections, local votes and political surveys that showed that the League had nearly doubled its support since the  elections, while that of the -Stars had essentially fallen by half.But Mr Salvini, whose popularity soared with on his anti-migrant policies, did not count on the former political foes closing ranks to block his bid for power.Mr Conte, , is seen as an ally of the -Stars, even though the law professor had no party affiliation when he became premier in June .He kept a relatively low profile during the -month -Star-League government, but, before handing in his resignation to Mr Mattarella, he lashed out at Mr Salvini for forcing his government to collapse."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles. It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University’s CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure “a new, more broadly based agreement” which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin. A basis had been laid for future discussions.The CAIN website, whose workers are based at the Magee campus in Derry, provides an extensive range of information and source material on the conflict and politics from  to the present day.The site is used by a worldwide audience and has received more than  million visits since it was launched in March .Earlier this year, the Derry News revealed that it was under threat of closure but thanks to a staunch defence of the site mounted by academics and researchers, Ulster University announced a nine-month reprieve while funding options are explored.Around  documents relating to the years  and  have been added to the CAIN website as part of ongoing work involving the Ulster University and the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland .The latest additions will bring to more than , the number of PRONI records available on CAIN.Dr Brendan Lynn, CAIN Deputy Director, said the archive is delighted to have been able to continue its cooperation with PRONI and to update the existing section with material dealing with the years  and .Mr Lynn commented: “CAIN has always sought to work with and iniduals, groups and organisations with relevant information relating to the Northern Ireland ‘troubles’ in order to make it available on-line.“An obvious example of this has been the partnership that CAIN has developed with The Public Record Office of Northern Ireland . As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time. It is an invaluable resource for anyone studying our recent past.”To access the documents you can visit: https:cain.ulster.ac.uk proni googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all. Wersquove called on the Housing Executive numerous times and used up all the repair forms at the back of our rent book, but still no-one had it fixed.Mrs Mildred Terry was equally unhappy. ldquoThe last time they came to fix the fireplace three years ago, they simply pushed it back against the wall and plastered it over the wallpaper which we had just put on, she said.ldquoIt became a big nuisance having to hope that friendly neighbours would help us wash our clothes and provide us with baths, because we were unable to heat our water by the use of the fire.BISHOPSCOURT mdash Police are investigating the circumstances leading to the death of an RAF sergeant at Bishopscourt last Tuesday evening.

I hope that by implementing this action plan we can make a real dference to the residents of our district.Last year, there was across-the-board political support for a motion calling for a major housing conference to take place to address the social housing crisis.At the time, it was revealed that Newcastle was a social housing need hot spot with  people on the waiting list for new homes classed in the urgent need category.Politicians were told that a lack of available land to build new homes was exacerbating the crisis in a resort where rented properties were at a premium, with houses that do come on the market snapped up by people for use as holiday homes.Councillors say they are keen for all ious stakeholders collaborating to provide short, medium and long term solutions to tackle the crisis.In addition, they are keen to see a focus on building appropriate housing for the changing needs of the district, including the increasing demand for single occupancy dwellings and housing that meets the needs of vulnerable people.Politicians say more affordable housing is also required as house price growth is higher in Newry, Mourne and Down than the average growth experienced across Northern Ireland.They say there is a need to plan for long term needs, tackle homelessness and the poverty gap, social housing development and accessible homes provision.Politicians say they hope that by working with partners across the statutory, community, voluntary and private sectors, they can come up with solutions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Special film of Canon’s Excursion brings back memories  ","story":"THE screening of a special short film on the old Canonrsquos Excursion in Downpatrick took place at the townrsquos Ballymote Centre last weekend.Every summer, over  buses packed with local families would head off from the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic but thoroughly enjoyable day.The last excursion is believed to have been held in the s, but local people last weekend had a unique opportunity to relive those halcyon days, thanks to a new initiative being spearheaded by the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association.It helped put together the short film which captures some of the the sights and sounds of the Canonrsquos Excursion which was one of the key events in Downpatrickrsquos social calendar.The film was screened last Friday night in front of a number of Stream Street residents and Housing Executive representatives when all those involved in the project were publicly thanked for their support.John Gordon, a member of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which played a key role in getting the film project off the ground, was delighted to many people attended last weekendrsquos screening.ldquoIt was great to see some of the original Stream Street residents attend the screening which also provided people with an opportunity to reminisce about the old days, particularly the Canonrsquos Excursion which was a big event, he explained.John said the project to produce a film depicting the annual event was launched around two years ago and is pleased those who attended Friday nightrsquos event enjoyed themselves.ldquoA number of old photographs were also on display which brought back many memories for some, he

sparked calls for action to be taken against teenagers terrorising the community in the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable. The perpetrators must be dealt with.Mr McGrath said police and other statutory agencies require information to challenge the anti-social behaviour and apprehend those responsible.He added: ldquoInformation can be provided confidentially and is needed to help break this cycle of behaviour at this part of Downpatrick.Police have asked anyone who believes they can assist them with their enquiries to make contact using the non-emergency  number or the confidential Crimestoppers number,  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10236703.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"derrygonnelly man s burgled","story":"Detectives are appealing for information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Lough Shore Road area of Derrygonnelly.Detective Constable McCabe stated that it wasreported that the burglary took place at some stage between Saturday afternoonand Monday morning .ldquoA sum of money was stolen from the home of a man in his eighties.Enquiries are continuing and we are appealing to anyone with any information, or who saw anything suspicious in the area over the weekend, to contact us on , quoting reference number  of   ,\" Detective Constable McCabe explained.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Boris Johnson to reverse plans to suspend parliament before Brexit has commenced at the High Court in Belfast.Victims campaigner Raymond McCord is seeking an urgent injunction aimed at forcing the Prime Minister to change his advice to the Queen to prorogue the House of Commons.Mr McCord’s lawyers claim he received assurances that no such suspension would take place ahead of the October  deadline for the UK to leave the EU.They argued that the Government’s move to put parliament on hold for up to five weeks represents an unlawful attempt to thwart MPs from debating a potential no-deal Brexit..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default

.desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Ronan Lavery QC told the Court today: “My client watched the events which took place yesterday on television with some dismay.“There had been a response from the Prime Minister’s solicitors saying there’s no basis for an undertaking to be given... in relation to his request that parliament not be prorogued in advance of EU Brexit day.“Then yesterday happened, which seemed to be at odds with not an undertaking, but an assurance there was nothing to worry about.”Mr McCord, whose son Raymond Jr was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in , is mounting a wider legal challenge against any withdrawal from the EU without an agreement.The Belfast man claims a departure on those terms would breach the Good Friday Agreement.According to his legal team the use of prorogation is also unconstitutional, with the policy posing a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process.With the Prime Minister pledging the UK will leave the EU on October  “do or die”, the judicial review challenge is listed for hearing next month.However, the application for an injunction was lodged after Mr Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament.“It’s an unprecedented prorogation,” Mr Lavery contended.Stolen car involved in Kettering crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Pressed by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan to identy an unlawful use of the power, counsel alleged an ulterior purpose.“It’s to impede the amount of parliamentary time that is available to debate,” he said.Adjourning the application until Friday, Sir Declan requested amendments to the papers.Outside court Mr McCord claimed a no deal Brexit could have dire consequences.“This could wreck the peace process,” he predicted.“I want the court to clearly state this is unlawful, and that what Boris Johnson is doing isn’t for the good of the country, it’s for his own agenda and to try and sideline parliament.”His solicitor, Ciaran O’Hare of McIvor Farrell, added: “As has been predicted by police, politicians and commentators, such a policy is likely to lead to economic turmoil,not long term recession, and medicine and food shortages. “Indeed, the likelihood of civil unrest in the circumstances must be high, as well as a raising of sectarian tensions between groups in Northern Ireland. “The delicate constitutional balance which has thus far been achieved, will be destroyed.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has been identiedMan arrested on suspicion of child cruelty after baby found deadDean Harrison ruled out of Classic TT after

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis said that the settlement “was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens”.Sir Jonathan remains as the NIO’s permanent secretary, its most senior official.A month ago the News Letter revealed that all images of the Queen – even one of her shaking hands with Martin McGuinness – were then banned from the walls of Stormont House. NIO minister Lord Duncan said at the time that the department “takes steps to ensure no such images are displayed in Stormont House”.Reacting to widespread criticism of the move, new Secretary of State Julian Smith then tweeted a small image of the Queen on the mantel piece of his private office within the building, but the NIO declined to say whether it had only been placed there in response to criticism of the initial decision.Mr Smith ordered a civil service review of the initial decisions. Despite having begun at the height of the holiday season, that review has now been completed in an unusually brisk time frame for the slow-turning wheels of bureaucracy.The News Letter understands that a photo of the Queen on her own has been placed in the main entrance corridor of Stormont House - the first place where guests go when visiting the property - along with another image of the Queen with Irish President Michael D Higgins and an image of Prince Charles in a church with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh.The images are part of a wider series of photos, one of which is of commemorations at the Ulster Tower for the fallen at the Somme. Officials believe the images as a whole represent a balanced range.A source close to Secretary of State Julian Smith said: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.” pictured outside the High Court in Belfast where he was seeking an emergency injunction stopping Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament.

At the time of Lord Maginnis’s remarks, all that the NIO would say was: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”The NIO said: “A portrait of the Queen – our head of state – is on display in the public area of Stormont House alongside a balanced set of images celebrating and reflecting the work of the Northern Ireland Office.”try catch  TrendingWoman whose body was found in NI town has

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
