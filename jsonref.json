Evans, 21, and Alfie’s mother Kate James, 20, want to take Alfie to the Vatican’s Bambino Gesu Pediatric Hospital.An air ambulance was ready on stand-by to transfer him to Italy, it was reported.Lawyers for Alfie’s parents had secured Tuesday’s hearing a day after the toddler’s life support was withdrawn after a series of court rulings blocked further medical treatment.Alfie’s parents Tom Evans and Kate James (Picture: PA)Alfie’s father Tom Evans said earlier Tuesday that Alfie survived for six hours with no assistance, and that doctors had subsequently resumed providing oxygen and hydration.In court, the family’s lawyer, Paul Diamond, read a statement from Tom Evans saying his son was doing ‘significantly better’ than previously believed.Doctors say it is hard to estimate how long Alfie will live without life support, but that there is no chance his condition will improve.At Tuesday’s emergency court hearing in Manchester, the judge asked whether there might be ‘other options’ that involved Alfie’s parents taking their son home.Emotions have run high over the case, which has seen Alfie’s parents supported by a Christian charity and a band of supporters known as ‘Alfie’s Army’ protesting regularly outside the hospital. They have blocked roads and on Monday tried to storm a door of the hospital before being pushed back by police.Pope Francis has met Alfie’s father and made appeals for the boy’s parents’ wishes to be heeded, saying only God can decide who dies.The head of the Bambino Gesu Hospital said the Italian defense ministry had a plane ready to transport Alfie to Italy if he were allowed.In an interview with Italian Radio 24, Mariella Enoc, who travelled to Liverpool to personally try to intervene on behalf of the parents, said she spoke to the Italian ambassador in London who said the plane could leave with him in a matter of minutes.On Monday, the Italian foreign ministry announced it had granted Alfie Italian citizenship to facilitate his arrival and transport.MORE: Jacob Rees-Mogg accuses House of Lords of ‘playing with fire’ over BrexitMORE: Jeremy Hunt has asked Tories if they’ve got any idea how to fix the NHS"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7769637.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"rent mel 615 month room newington green","story":"Mel lives with three other people in Newington Green. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Welcome back to What I Rent, our new weekly series that’s getting rid of the confusion and mystery around renting in London.We’re hoping that by taking everyone inside a different person’s home each week and showing you all the details, we’ll help to answer a bunch of questions everyone has about finding a place to live.How much is a normal amount to pay? How much space should you expect to get in return? Is that level of mould acceptable?This week we’re inside the rented home of Mel Evans, an ex-Aussie who moved to London last year.She’s been there for around nine months. (Picture: Alexander Crawleymetro)Hey Mel! How much rent are you paying?£615 a month, bills not included.How much do you have to pay in bills?Everything is pre-paid, so we’ll whack £40 on electricity every month or so split between four of us, same on gas (which should be drastically reduced now we won’t be using the heaters), council tax is £98 odd a month split again, and then internet is about £16 each a month.And where are you living?Newington Green – that delightful patch of wonder below Stoke Newington, to the left of Dalston, above Canonbury and De Beauvoir and depending on who I’m talking to I have said I’ve lived in each one of these at any given time.What are you actually getting for your money?Four bedrooms and two-ish bathrooms. One has a shower, toilet, sink etc – the other is just a tiny hole that has a shower.(Picture: Alexander Crawley)How long have you been there?I moved in August, 2017. So charging towards nine months. Everyone else lived here another year before that.Do you like it?I LOVE the greater area – Canonbury, the actually green bit of Newington Green.Now the sunshine is out everyone plonks themselves on their patch of green and loves life – and if you’re feeling extra fruity, Clissold Park is only a 15 min walk away where ALL THE DOGS hang out.There are also amazing cafes nearby – with some good Aussie coffee, may I add – and it’s generally a lovely, leafy part of the city with a neighbourhood vibe and lots of Gen Y and hipster families that give the place a little je ne sais quoi.I love how it’s also walking distance to Highbury and Islington, because transport links aren’t that hot around here with no tube, but I am 10 minutes either way to DalstonCanonbury Overground and a six min walk from about 783 buses. You make it work. With a smile.Do you feel like you have enough space?In my bedroom? PAH!Luckily I moved over from Australia with a suitcase and carry on and nothing else, so I didn’t need much space. However, as I continue to build a life here and accumulate more I definitely need more space.(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Also, I’d like to not have to shimmy past my bed, knocking my knees on the bedhead, to get to my miniscule wardrobe, to have the door open and knock over the glass of water teetering on a random, non-moveable concrete block in the middle of my room. *Exhales*In the general house? Love it – luckily I’ve never been one to just hang out in my room, so majority of the time I’m only sleeping in my room and you don’t care about how small your room is when you’re unconscious.How did you find this place?Facebook! Some page along the lines of ‘East London rent’ – so much shoddy stuff, but this place was advertised by an Aussie (with two more in the house) and we had mutual friends back in Sydney, so I assumed they weren’t COMPLETELY bonkers.Do you live with people you knew beforehand?No! This is the first time I’ve lived with randoms (now friends, though, phew, the world is balanced again).Are there any major issues with the house you have to put up with?It’s in an old council block that has a working lift only part of the time (first world issues, I know, but when you’re three flights up carrying heavy shit, the lift would really come in handy) and I sense the sewerage system for the building is on the fritz due to the delightful smells that emanate through our windows.Can you tell she’s an Aussie? (Picture: Alexander CrawleyMwetro)I can also hear my neighbour snoring, so the walls are evidently very, VERY thin. Or he has some serious sinus issues. Apart from that, we’ve managed to turn an old flat into a very homely space for us.Any plans to move again?In the next few months I’ll be looking to move on. The two Aussies are planning to head back home from July, and I’m keen to live in another area of the city taste test another borough.Fancy living in this converted watermill in Hertfordshire?As much as I love the northeast, work is in the west and if I can cut my commute down in any way, even just down to two tubes, I’d be pretty chuffed. But that costs money. Sweet, sweet money.Have you considered buying a place?I mean, I consider it all the time! Will it happen? Not on your nelly!I’m a pretty keen saver, but there’s no way I’d be buying in London.I’d probably look at somewhere out of town as an investment and work my way in…what am I even talking about, this is years off. And several pay rises. And much, much less happy hour cocktails and said-expensive-Australian-coffee.Sounds like a struggle. Now, let’s take a look around Mel’s humble abode…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying. If you fancy taking part, please email whatirent@metro. You\u0027ll need to have pictures taken of your kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a few photos of you in your room. Make sure you get permission for your housemates!You\u0027ll also need to be okay with sharing how much you\u0027re paying for rent, as that\u0027s pretty important.

Around 4 p.m., after Madonna had given her small household staff the rest of the day off, he scaled the fence encircling the estate, broke into the house and confronted a terrified Madonna. \u0027After slapping her around, he bound and gagged her, then strapped her to a chair with twine. He berated and beat her for two hours, then stormed out of the house.\u0027 Maddona was eventually able to convince Penn to untie her according to the report, which stated: \u0027Once free, she dashed out of the house, jumped into the coral-colored 1957 Thunderbird Penn had bought her for her 28th birthday, locked the doors and called the police on her car phone. She then sped off to the Malibu sheriff\u0027s station to swear out a complaint against her husband.\u0027  Troubled times: Penn was briefly accused of assaulting then-wife Madonna in 1989, but the actress later denied he ever hit or abused her (couple on left in 1988) Allen was accused of molesting his adopted daughter Dylan (pair above in 1989) when she was a child, an allegation he deniesA week after filing that police report, Madonna changed her tune, however, and said the abuse never occurred reported the Times. She asked the district attorney to withdraw the charges, and a few hours later  filed for orce.The exes are now close friends, and Madonna even submitted a filing in support of Penn when he sued director Lee Daniels for $10 million back in 2015.That lawsuit was filed after Daniels was asked to comment on domestic abuse allegations that were being made against the star of his show Empire in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\u0027He ain\u0027t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn,\u0027 responded Daniels.Madonna did her best to aid Penn\u0027s complaint by submitting a court filing in which she stated:  \u0027I am also aware of allegations concerning an incident that occurred in December, 1989, which purportedly resulted in Sean’s arrest for domestic assault and battery against me. I know those allegations to be false. \u0027While we certainly had more than one heated argument during our marriage, Sean has never struck me, tied me up, or physically assaulted me, and any report to the contrary is completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.\u0027Penn and Daniels eventually settled that lawsuit with the director apologizing and making a charitable donation.  \u0027Empire\u0027s\u0027 \u0026quotBatshit Crazy\u0026quot Behind-the-Scenes Drama: On the Set of TV¿s Hottest Show | Hollywood ReporterEntertainment \u0026amp the Arts | A Marriage Filled With Abuse | Seattle Times NewspaperCharlie Rose spotted dining out with Sean Penn | Page SixDylan Farrow Describes Woody Allen¿s Alleged Sexual Abuse in Open Letter | Vanity Fair"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/23/4B77C16200000578-0-image-m-6_1524521947530.jpg","title":"Royal Baby resembles siblings George Charlotte","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/19/4B77B35800000578-0-image-m-181_1524507867432.jpg","title":"ARTHUR favourite newborn prince bookies paying Royal nod legendary king","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

But then, why should we be surprised?The Silicon Valley giants Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — known by the vampirish acronym FANGs —steadfastly refuse to be bound by moral scruples. They can’t be doing with the rules and conventions to tame the wildest extremes of capitalism which, for decades, have been accepted by enterprises across the globe.In the name of progress and freedom of access to their global community of users, the digital behemoths demand the right to flout every rule.

And police believe car thefts have soared — up 30 per cent in three years.Almost as shocking is another story that emerged this week of how Martin Lewis — founder of the advice website MoneySavingExpert and one of the country’s top finance advisers — claims Facebook published fake adverts seeking to cash in on his good name.          Facebook handed over private data of 87 million of its users to UK-based Cambridge AnalyticaIn his case the social media company may have made an enemy it could do without. The pugnacious entrepreneur has helped consumers in Britain and across the world save millions of pounds in excessive charges on financial products and household utilities.He is now suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams designed, he says, to ‘rip off vulnerable people’.He discovered iniduals were targeted with commercials for bogus get-rich-quick schemes which he supposedly endorsed. Lewis says he knows of one woman who lost £100,000 in a scam which temporarily had attached his name to the product to give it credibility.Facebook’s failure to banish such adverts highlights its ‘unending greed’, he says.He repeatedly asked Facebook to remove the adverts, he claims, but they were left online for days or weeks. And when they were taken down, another one, almost identical, would appear in its place.And this, surely is the point. Time and again, iniduals, politicians, business leaders and the police have asked the web giants to mend their ways. But they are ignored.          Martin Lewis, pictured, is suing Facebook for defamation after it published adverts which used his image on commercials for bogus get-rich-quick schemeDavid Jamieson, police and crime commissioner of the West Midlands, where car theft has soared by 80 per cent, wrote to eBay and Amazon asking them to remove the sale of car-hacking devices from their websites. Nothing happened.‘The fact that they have yet to respond or take them down means they’re helping criminals,’ he surmised.The trouble is that, at every turn, the web giants seem to prefer to help criminals rather than inconvenience themselves by limiting untrammelled access on the web.It required years of enormous media and political pressure to persuade the digital giants and computer manufacturers to make even the slightest concessions towards blocking access to the most vile forms of online child pornography.Despite incessant demands from the police and politicians to prevent terrorist recruitment online, Islamic State and other militant groups around the world are still connecting with each other, accessing bomb-making advice or buying detonators and other equipment to commit acts of violence.And, of course, the abuse is not confined to crime.Many of us have suspected it for years, but the Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how cynically and blatantly our personal data is harvested for commercial purposes without permission.Facebook and other social media sites such as WhatsApp (bought by Facebook for £11 billion in 2014) ruthlessly pillage our communications with friends and family to understand our likes and dislikes and pass data to advertisers.What is so amoral about the behaviour of the web giants is that, despite their endless protestations that they cannot control activity on the web, the reverse is the case.The same technological brainpower the FANGs use to take personal data and make us fodder for their greed could be directed towards curbing the criminal and intrusive behaviour they facilitate. The trouble is that these Silicon Valley giants are now so unimaginably wealthy, have such clout and so much job-creating capacity, that they can ignore the demands of politicians and policy-makers all over the world.Twenty North American cities — from Toronto in Canada to Austin, Texas — are currently engaged, for example, in a tawdry battle to be home to a second vast technological headquarters for Amazon.With the promise of $5 billion of investment to create 50,000 jobs, local politicians are falling over themselves to woo the web giant — and in such circumstances, who would dare raise the issues of tighter regulation or stricter taxation rules? Likewise, in Britain an open-door policy for Google at No 10 when David Cameron was Prime Minister almost certainly helped persuade the company to build magnificent European offices at King’s Cross in London which will eventually employ up to 9,000 people.Is it any wonder, therefore, that it has taken HMRC so long to get its teeth into alleged tax avoidance by the company and others like it?The extraordinary economic firepower which makes each of the digital giants unassailable has just been quantified by the International Monetary Fund. In 2017, sales of smartphones, the device of choice for online access, reached 1.5 billion units or one for every fifth person on Earth. Indeed, smartphones accounted for one-sixth of total world trade last year.Amazingly in Ireland, where Apple houses its intellectual property (the patents and know-how behind the iPhone), exports related to the phone accounted for one-quarter of the country’s economic expansion last year.That is why the Irish government objected when the European Commission — one of the few institutions trying to take on the web giants — gave Apple a £11.2 billion tax bill.So far, American politicians, like our own, have failed to show steel in the face of companies which, in their search for profits, have gone rogue, abandoning any pretence at ethical business practices.But there is a precedent for doing so.In the late 19th century, there was a giant company which the whole world thought was unassailable, so big and powerful was its size, scope and virtual monopoly. At the time, J. D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled 90 per cent of the U.S. oil market.Critics accused Rockefeller of engaging in unethical practices, such as predatory pricing and colluding with railroads to eliminate his competitors.But the U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt had the resolve to take it on. He used legislation to break it up into 34 separate companies and reduce its monopoly power.If only today’s policy-makers had the same gumption. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/21/4B7873C500000578-0-image-m-52_1524514421607.jpg","title":"Todays Mac Cartoon","story":"    ‘Really?

We won Wales In Bloom last year, but I don’t think we’ll be winning it again this year.’ An additional problem is that the shaggy goats carry parasites. ‘Last year we had twenty instances of children with ticks,’ he said.‘This summer we’re going to have many more because the goats have been on the school field – sunbathing and lounging among the plants.’In February, the Royal Welch Fusiliers tried to capture a kid from the herd to use as a mascot.

He said there were no legal grounds for blocking the deal.But a string of MPs urged him to change the law to prevent further ‘predators’ snapping up key British firms.Hedge funds bought up 25 per cent of GKN’s shares in a few weeks to help force through the takeover, helping seal a deal that was approved by a margin of 52 to 48.Tory MP Lucy Allan said the future of GKN was ‘determined by speculators who came on to the share register in the final weeks of the bid process to make a quick profit’.She said this was ‘no way to determine the future of a great British manufacturing company’ and called for a review of takeover rules.Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chairman of the Commons business committee, asked the Government to ‘look again at the takeover code, particularly for businesses so integral to our industrial strategy and for businesses that have received a lot of taxpayer funding’.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the role of hedge funds had been ‘highly destabilising’. He suggested shareholders should be forced to wait a certain period before qualifying for a vote.Mr Clark said he was open to looking at takeover rules again, but suggested he thought they were working well. He also suggested hedge funds would have been unable to snap up shares if long-term investors had had more confidence in GKN’s management.Melrose has previously said it was willing to make a ‘legally-binding’ commitment not to sell GKN’s aerospace ision before April 2023.For a period of five years, Melrose will keep its headquarters in the UK and its shares listed on the stock market in London. It will also ensure the majority of its directors live in the UK.Melrose will also ensure that spending on research and development at GKN will equal at least 2.2 per cent of GKN sales every year up to 2023.Comment – Page 16 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/02/1701902100000514-5654003-image-a-65_1524618193381.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament","story":"    Labour MP Mary Creagh, pictured, is the head of the nannyish environment audit select committeeAfter that hot weekend, MPs discussed heatwaves. The session was arranged by the environmental audit select committee. This nannyish group is chaired by Labour’s Mary Creagh, who first made her name at Westminster by worrying about the temperature of bath water.Pleasant but fretful Ms Creagh has a brow default-set to frowns. She thinks ill-fate can be neutered by a risk-assessing, intervening political class.Little fun on a skiing trip, I suspect. Before her committee yesterday sat a chap from the Met Office, Peter Stott, and a duo from the state-paid, non-governmental Committee on Climate Change. They were Kathryn Brown and Michael Davies, though he should have been called Michael Mrphhh, he was such a mumbler. Sister Brown began almost every reply with ‘so’. You know the type.The Met Office’s Stott was asked for the official definition of a heatwave. He didn’t really have one. Instead he gave a very British answer: a heatwave was when it was hot for two consecutive nights. South of Suez, they would snort at such wimpishness. Two nights? Two years, surely. But here in Blighty if the mercury rises above 30 degrees celsius (86F) for a couple of nights, a hosepipe ban cannot be long delayed.Ms Creagh: ‘Was it a heatwave last weekend?’ Mr Stott: ‘We’re calling that a hot spell.’ Sometimes science can sound awfully like a hairdresser’s smalltalk. Ms Creagh was in anguish.          Zac Goldsmith, pictured,  asked if hotter weather would bring benefits from tourismShe feared that ‘the lack of a formal definition of a heatwave could be an obstacle to public understanding. There’s no narrative about when to look after your old people.’At the word ‘narrative’, my bluster-antennae always tingle.Ms Creagh said a 2003 heatwave killed 15,000 in France. She pressed her witnesses for ‘gender analysis’ of heatwave deaths. They seemed to know of little, though Prof Mrphhh did utter a few indistinct words still being deciphered by my analysts. Mr Stott, filling the gap with statements of the obvious, disclosed that the South-East of England tended to be hotter than northern parts of Britain.The Good Ship Rudd juddered... but did not sink: QUENTIN LETTS sees the humbling of the Home SecretaryQUENTIN LETTS: Take it from a father of three, William – you’re about to learn the plate-spinning horror of being OUTNUMBERED The star who’s SIMPLY THE BEST as Tina Turner…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina musical Radiating grandeur, Lord Patten of Barnes milked his adoring audience as the unelected House threw what it intends to be a ner in the Brexit works… QUENTIN LETTS on yesterday in ParliamentPowerful tale of Tina that’s simply the best…QUENTIN LETTS reviews the Tina Turner musicalAs Labour MPs round on their leader QUENTIN LETTS watches as Corbyn muttered like a bulldog chomping on nettlesQUENTIN LETTS watches the PM defend sending in the RAF in Parliament as Labour MPs shook their heads in disagreement with Jeremy CorbynLusty revival has two waggy stars: QUENTIN LETTS reviews The Fantastic Follies Of Mrs Rich QUENTIN LETTS: Its timing may bounce around like a pinball over two months, but I pray Easter never becomes a fixed date No! Was human activity to blame for heatwaves? ‘Even without human activity there would still have been heatwaves,’ he said, but ‘the likelihood of heatwaves was at least doubled by humans.’Ms Creagh nodded with glum satisfaction. ‘Have you got any more granular breakdown on that?’ she asked. ‘Granular’ is another word that sets off hooters in my ear.Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) broke through the pessimism to ask if hotter weather might bring benefits (eg, from tourism). Ms Brown cautiously agreed that we could do ‘comparatively favourably’ from ‘thermal comfort’ modelling.Translation: hotter weather would be good. The mumbling professor indicated that 40,000 oldies currently die from cold weather but deaths from heat are only 2,000. Ms Creagh glowered. Good news wasn’t what she was after at all.Caroline Lucas (Brighton Pavilion) sloped off after just 41 minutes. She may be Parliament’s only Green but that was enough environmental auditing for her, thank ye. What an important person she is.Headline-seeker Geraint Davies (Lab, Swansea W) asked if roads would have to be closed in heatwaves and marathon runners told to stop.Should doctors be told to take their holidays in summertime. The witnesses did not supply him with a usable soundbite. Maddening for him.The usual grindings of politics were on display: MPs seeking publicity and craving alarmism, a public-sector bureaucracy roboting management-speak. Endless baloney about ‘sophisticated modelling’, which always makes me think of Brigitte Bardot in her prime.Prof Mumbler said it was ‘very challenging to set thresholds for comfort in the built environment’ – ie you can’t generalise about how warm a building should be. Ms Brown spoke of ‘the mortality burden’ (ie deaths) and ‘complicated decision trees’ (dithering hospital bosses).

The lack of supply is pushing up prices, leaving young families struggling to get on the ladder.The Government believes that building 300,000 homes a year in England by 2025 is the answer and has ordered local authorities to outline suitable locations.Last month Prime Minister Theresa May warned that if councils don\u0027t build enough houses they will lose their right to determine where they are placed. Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, told them he\u0027d be \u0027breathing down their neck\u0027.But Britain\u0027s latest housebuilding drive has led to fierce debates within communities about where these properties should go. At one extreme are the Nimbys (Not In My Back Yard) who don\u0027t want any housebuilding in their neighbourhood for fear the construction would ruin their views and be too noisy.At the other you have a new breed of campaigners nicknamed \u0027Yimbys\u0027 (Yes In My Back Yard) who want housing to help their children and grandchildren raise families.The majority sit somewhere between, pushed and pulled by these factions.          Against: Anna Martin, pictured with daughters Iona (centre) and Annabel, walks and jogs in the woods most days of the weekEastleigh, which must build 14,580 new homes by 2036, is a prime example of the new dynamic. It was one of 15 councils shamed last year for being too slow to put a plan in place. Now the council has revealed a proposal to build nearly 2,000 more homes than required.It has sparked uproar among the residents guiding me around the area. They\u0027re concerned that one in three houses is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood, and the idea of a road through the middle appals them.They tell me one Yimby is pushing this development more than anyone else — Keith House. The Liberal Democrat leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, who has held that role for more than 20 years, claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxes.\u0027It has been known and accepted for years that we need to build more homes in the right places,\u0027 he says. \u0027While this shift from buying to renting is fine in London and other big cities, there isn\u0027t the stock in the suburbs and on the South coast.\u0027There is a change of tone in the housing debate as people realise that it\u0027s their sons and daughters who can\u0027t afford homes.\u0027It\u0027s clear why families would want to live in a location such as this. You\u0027d have rural Hampshire on your doorstep while being a 30-minute drive from Southampton and within commuting distance of London.And Mr House is adamant he can deliver the schools, roads and other facilities that will be needed here.\u0027All too often councils put the houses up first and then fail to deliver on the infrastructure,\u0027 he says. \u0027We\u0027re committed to putting that in — it\u0027s in the plans.\u0027          Lib Dem councillor Keith House claims the development will create jobs and bring in extra council taxesBut resident Bruce Mitchell, 55, a civil servant, accuses Mr House of ignoring overwhelming opposition. More than 30 people, including environmental experts and charities, spoke against the proposals at a meeting in December that ran on until after 1am, he says.The mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors have quit the Lib Dems over the plans, to run as independents. Even Eastleigh\u0027s Tory MP, Mims Davies, says the move was \u0027panicked and rushed\u0027.Helen Kerris Shaw, 39, who runs an animal charity where the development will be, says: \u0027I\u0027ve volunteered at the charity since I was nine and it\u0027s quite shocking to think it might all be bulldozed over.\u0027Anne Martin, 46, who walks and jogs in the woods most days of the week, says Mr House isn\u0027t thinking about the quality of life in the area.\u0027There are very few places you can go and have such quietness,\u0027 she says. \u0027It is just so short-sighted.\u0027Anne\u0027s daughter Iona, 11, who was highly commended in the British Wildlife Photography Awards, says the road will be like a \u0027Berlin Wall\u0027 for animals which live in the woods.According to the Woodland Trust, just 2 per cent of the UK is ancient woodland which has existed since records began in 1600 in England and Wales, and 1750 in Scotland.Jack Taylor, of the Woodland Trust, says light and road pollution are major threats to wildlife that rarely get mentioned. \u0027These woodlands could be saved with thoughtful design, and people in Eastleigh are right to be alarmed,\u0027 he says.Environmentalists are also concerned that the new road will damage the nearby Itchen river, which has European Special Area of Conservation status. TV naturalist Chris Packham, who grew up in nearby Southampton, has described the plan as \u0027eco-vandalism\u0027.Kate Beal-Blyth, 40, is a member of local action group Action Against Destructive Development.She\u0027s lived in Eastleigh most of her life, running a television production company, and says the group recognises the need to build but says that, with a new railway station and motorway junction, these could be nearer the centre of the borough.          Green belt: One in three houses in the Eastleigh development is earmarked for greenfield land around Stoke Park Wood\u0027We desperately need new homes — they are just being built in the wrong place,\u0027 she says. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, there is space on brownfield land — which has previously been developed — to build one million homes around the country. Many sites already have planning permission so homes can go up straight away, the group says.But PricedOut, which aims to help young people get on the housing ladder, says that won\u0027t be enough. It claims much of the green belt isn\u0027t as beautiful as people think — and banning new-builds prevents people from living near work.Mr House agrees. \u0027Every time we have had major development there is inevitable local opposition,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in this case, there is no alternative solution closer to the town centre with the right infrastructure.\u0027Mr House insists he wants to protect the woodland and says the council is not building more homes than Eastleigh needs, as the plan takes into account long-term trends. He says 35 per cent will be affordable housing, with a mix of different property types.          Kate Beal-Blyth is a member of Action Against Destructive DevelopmentSome communities may be able to avoid the sort of disputes that are splitting opinion in Eastleigh.One idea gaining popularity is to fill empty homes before building new ones. More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for at least ten years, according to the Liberal Democrats. About 216,000 have been empty for six months. The Government announced last November that it would allow councils to charge double tax on properties that have been unoccupied and unfurnished for two years or more.The Intergenerational Foundation think tank says the Government should focus on filling empty rooms in homes. There are 25 million spare bedrooms in England, it says, adding that many houses are owned by empty-nest pensioners in family-sized houses.For many the costs of downsizing — estimated by Money Mail last year at £29,000 on average — are too off-putting. Experts such as John Godfrey, Theresa May\u0027s former head of policy, say a stamp duty tax break for downsizers could free up these properties for growing families.Mrs May has also suggested former shops could be turned into homes as more people buy online. She says Britain should look to build up as well as out — which could mean using spaces above shops, too.The Prime Minister plans to relax planning rules so people can add two more floors to many properties.Some experts have even suggested building above car parks. Property agency JLL says it has identified 868 car parks within a mile of a station in London that could support an average of 90 homes each. Another concept gaining popularity is the prefab home. These houses are fabricated in factories in as little as 20 days.           Picturesque: The River Itchen which borders the proposed development is one of the world\u0027s most exclusive fishing areasThey are then transported to the necessary location where they take just a few hours to erect. The benefit would be building more homes more quickly, limiting the disruption and noise that cause concern to many Nimbys.The Government hopes that garden towns — whole towns and villages built in commuter belt territory — will also provide room for thousands more homes. Some 14 developments were approved last year from Cornwall to Cumbria. Five in the corridor between Oxford and Cambridge are in the pipeline.Mrs May says she\u0027s working to speed up the planning process to boost housebuilding. Plus there will be a crackdown on developers who sit on land and wait for its value to rise to maximise profits.Yet for residents in areas such as Eastleigh, where councils are under pressure to build thousands of homes right now, these alternatives are emerging too late.Unless enough people back an affordable, sustainable alternative — and win over councillors whose reputations are on the line — campaigners may be fighting a losing battle.It could mean some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful rural areas, whether the locals like it or not, change irrevocably. And as Eastleigh\u0027s 11-year-old photography star Iona Martin is at pains to tell me, that\u0027s causing a great deal of heartache.v.bischoff@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/07/4B7BAB0B00000578-0-image-m-34_1524549935724.jpg","title":"Petition calling Queen help save Alfie Evans reaches 110 000 signatures two days","story":"    Supporters shared this photo of mother Kate James cradling her son at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, where doctors have withdrawn life supportJudge REJECTS Alfie Evans parents\u0027 bid to fly their...We have air ambulances waiting to take him to Italy, says...Share this articleBut this was refused by the judge and doctors turned off Alfie\u0027s systems 24-hours agoThis evening Alfie\u0027s father told reporters outside the hospital that his mother \u0027was giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep him alive\u0027 after his lips began to turn blue.The petition, started by Kayleigh Price on Change.org, begins: \u0027We the undersigned humbly petition Your Majesty for protection of life and liberty of your 23-month-old subject Alfie Evans.\u0027          The petition had gathered an astonishing 112,000 names at the time of writing          An intervention by the Queen would mark an extraordinary turn in the tale - but would likely trigger a constitutional crisisIt continues, making a number of claims about the treatment of the child.\u0027The judges in Your Majesty\u0027s Court have given orders: to kill Alfie on an appointed hour at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool by withdrawing his life support.\u0027For the day and hour of that killing to be kept secret from the public to avoid any protest or hindrance For Alfie to be detained in Alder Hey until his death – any attempt to release him to be resisted by force, and punished by imprisonment.\u0027The petition also attacks the judges who have ruled on Alfie\u0027s case including from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European Court of Human Rights.

He said there were no legal grounds for blocking the deal.But a string of MPs urged him to change the law to prevent further ‘predators’ snapping up key British firms.Hedge funds bought up 25 per cent of GKN’s shares in a few weeks to help force through the takeover, helping seal a deal that was approved by a margin of 52 to 48.Tory MP Lucy Allan said the future of GKN was ‘determined by speculators who came on to the share register in the final weeks of the bid process to make a quick profit’.She said this was ‘no way to determine the future of a great British manufacturing company’ and called for a review of takeover rules.Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chairman of the Commons business committee, asked the Government to ‘look again at the takeover code, particularly for businesses so integral to our industrial strategy and for businesses that have received a lot of taxpayer funding’.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the role of hedge funds had been ‘highly destabilising’. He suggested shareholders should be forced to wait a certain period before qualifying for a vote.Mr Clark said he was open to looking at takeover rules again, but suggested he thought they were working well. He also suggested hedge funds would have been unable to snap up shares if long-term investors had had more confidence in GKN’s management.Melrose has previously said it was willing to make a ‘legally-binding’ commitment not to sell GKN’s aerospace ision before April 2023.For a period of five years, Melrose will keep its headquarters in the UK and its shares listed on the stock market in London.

The painting is one of 22 reclining nudes completed by Modigliani, many of them exhibited at a scandalising exhibition in Paris in 1917. “Together these pictures signal a watershed in perhaps the greatest tradition in art,” said Shaw. “There is nude before Modigliani, and there is nude after Modigliani.”Modigliani is one of only three artists whose work has broken the $150m barrier at auction. Another of his reclining nudes sold for $170.4m at Christie’s New York in 2015. It was bought by the Chinese billionaire Liu Yiqian and his wife, Wang Wei, described by the Financial Times as “one of the world’s flashiest art collectors”.At the time, that sale represented the second highest amount paid at auction behind Pablo Picasso’s Women of Algiers (version O), which sold at Christie’s in 2015 for nearly $180m. They were both overtaken by the $450m paid last year for Leonardo da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi by the Louvre Abu Dhabi.It would be a huge surprise if the Modigliani got anywhere near to that figure but even so, anywhere close to its estimate represents an eye-catching profit for its present owner who is, according to Bloomberg, the Irish racing tycoon and Coolmore Stud owner, John Magnier. He reportedly bought it for $26.9m in 2003.At 147cm wide, it is the largest work Modigliani painted. The majority of his reclining nudes are in museums, particularly in the US. The Guggenheim, MoMa and the Met in New York own one each. The only one in the UK is in the Courtauld Gallery in London.Shaw said Modigliani was assimilating a world of visual cultures across centuries in the reclining nudes series. “From Egyptian, Japanese, African, Indian and Iberian sculpture, from Renaissance frescoes through Romanticism to the cutting-edge of Cubism.”When the nudes went on display at the Paris gallery of the dealer Berthe Weill there was huge interest. It was closed after a day with one police officer incredulous at the inclusion of pubic hair.Modigliani is the archetypal starving-in-a-garret bohemian artist. He was a womaniser who enjoyed rum, absinthe, opium, hashish and cocaine before expiring as a result of alcohol-aggravated tuberculosis in 1920, aged 35.Nu couché was included in a roomful of nudes at Tate Modern show for the largest Modigliani show ever staged in the UK, and featured on the cover of the catalogue. The painting will be sold in New York in May, part of Sotheby’s big evening sale of impressionist and modern art. The expectation is that, like the previous Modigliani, the buyer will come from Asia.The Modigliani Wang and Liu bought in 2015 was for their art museum in Shanghai. In an interview with the FT (£), Wang said: “We need to collect foreign art so that our museums can be on a par with their foreign peers. Foreign countries have really a lot of museums, big and small, public or private. But we think China is lacking something when it comes to art … Even if we have enough food, we will be empty inside if we don’t have spiritual fulfilment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34982ebdfd5c7e028ed3d2308554376d3733498c/0_35_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27513bfe03d44a5bbc017391076af7a0","title":"blue palace blenheim to celebrate colour visionary yves klein","story":"Work by artist – famed for his intense ultramarine hue – to feature in ancestral home of the ChurchillsThere will be no naked women rolling in searingly blue paint at Blenheim Palace this summer, but the stupendously grand rooms will hold some of the most famous paintings by the French artist Yves Klein – the Anthropometry series created at live events for which he used volunteers as human paint brushes.More than half a century after his death in 1962, aged just 34, his trademark intense ultramarine blue – a pigment he saw as bridging the gap between the real world and the sublime through pure colour – is still officially known as International Klein Blue.This summer the palace will house the most comprehensive UK exhibition of Klein’s work, in what would have been his 90th year. It will include paintings and installation pieces, and classically inspired sculptures such as a version of the Venus de Milo, challenging the antique marbles filling many of the state rooms.“His attitude to life was that everything was possible as long as you set your mind to it – a very positive outlook on the world which is perhaps something we need more than ever now,” said the curator Michael Frahm. “He died too young, but he was hugely hard working, and his work remains highly influential, one of the most original and influential artists of the 20th century.”Frahm is the director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, founded in 2014 by Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill to bring annual exhibitions of contemporary art into the bewilderingly grand formal rooms of his family home. The series has formerly featured living artists and launched with a major exhibition from Ai Weiwei. The Chinese artist was then under house arrest in Beijing but toured the the space to plan the installation through a specially created 3D computer model. The exhibition proved so popular its run had to be extended twice.The 18th-century Oxfordshire palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and set in a landscape designed by the famed gardener Capability Brown, has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 1987. Blenheim was conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough for his victories in war, but as the costs escalated dizzyingly funds stopped with £220,000 spent and the 28,330-sq-metre (seven-acre) house only half completed.

Thursday’s Commons debate on borders and customs regimes after Brexit is a crucial opportunity for MPs to fire a very clear shot across the government’s bows in favour of the softest possible Brexit. The Commons will be debating a motion on Thursday, not a piece of legislation – the latter opportunity will come when the trade bill and the EU withdrawal bill are again discussed by MPs next month. Yet this week’s motion is anything but trivial. It supports frictionless post-Brexit trade borders for manufacturers and it insists on continuing alignments across the Irish border. It is moved by the backbench liaison committee of select committee chairs, so it has backing from senior parliamentarians from Labour, the Conservatives, the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. The\u0026nbspoutcome must send an unequivocal message that we\u0026nbsphave reached make your mind up time.As so often in the Brexit process, the government’s approach is to continue to kick the can down the proverbial road. But the end of the road is in sight. With local elections due next week, the Conservatives have imposed a light whip on their MPs. Some select committees, including the Brexit committee, are scheduled to be on overseas visits. It is important, nevertheless, that as many pro-European MPs as possible attend this debate and vote for the motion. Most businesses in Britain, especially in manufacturing, want to remain in the customs union or to join one that is effectively the same thing after Brexit. Crucially, the government has also made a solemn agreement with the EU to maintain a frictionless border in Ireland. Both are essential. This motion must be carried.The aim on Thursday and next month must be to maximise the pressure on the government to make the best possible compromise with the EU on customs and tariffs, for the sake of both industry and Britain’s commitments on Northern Ireland. Theresa May prefers indecision and brinkmanship. So, at present, does the EU, under strong pressure from France and Germany to make sure Brexit is not rewarded. But\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspprinciples at the heart of the argument – and the parliamentary numbers when the bills return – are\u0026nbspabout to become inescapable.One further large truth, too often ignored, is that the leavers’ trumpeted alternative of bilateral post-Brexit trade deals – which would not be possible if the UK embraced any version of the EU customs union – is a sham. These deals simply don’t exist. Liam\u0026nbspFox, the international trade secretary, has drawn an embarrassing blank as he tours the world touting for deregulatory deals. MPs face a choice between a fantasy future and a solid commercially secure future based on existing arrangements. It would be phenomenally irresponsible to opt for the former against the latter. It’s a no-brainer.Some ministers have floated the idea of making this issue a confidence vote. That shows how vulnerable they are. It is why Thursday’s initial skirmish matters. MPs need to increase the pressure on the government as the Lords amendments to the Brexit bill pile up. Sooner or later Mrs May is going to have to get real about the business case, the Northern Ireland case, and the parliamentary numbers. She also needs to get real about the compromises that will be required with the EU if this is to be made to work. Mrs May has got away for too long with promoting the pyrrhic freedom of a fantasy Brexit. That no longer washes. It is compromise time now. Mrs May can’t duck it. And MPs must ensure that she does not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a586fd9730debbff22ec05ed87b3a138fcee2f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aca97122a65e021c1f8c7f95e700f426","title":"tory windrush brexiters theresa may black votes","story":"By pandering to Brexiters, Theresa May has trashed her party’s progress in attracting black and ethnic minority votesA faraway scene comes to mind when I think about the Conservatives and black Britain – and it should trouble Theresa May as she surveys the wreckage of the Windrush fiasco. It\u0026nbspis of a man who lives in my father’s Jamaican village, at the top of the hill, who each day has to come down to the village square to fill plastic barrels with standpipe water. Once I tried to help him carry just one of them and almost suffered a hernia. He is the epitome of what brought the Windrushers to Britain. The social services are minimal the communal provision is patchy. They are\u0026nbsppeople who know that, by and large, what they need\u0026nbspthey must eke out for themselves.Margaret Thatcher, had she not been gripped by irrational dread of “alien cultures”, would have liked their way of thinking. Certainly her party as we know it today should benefit from a younger generation whose political thinking has been inspired by can-do forebears, especially as they move into higher income and social demographic groups.The reason it does not is that, through words and deeds, the Conservative party presents to a critical mass of black people as racist. Think of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, custom-built to restrict black migration and condemned by Hugh Gaitskell as “cruel and brutal anti-colour legislation”. Think of the 1964 Smethwick election, with its unofficial Tory candidate slogan: “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” Think Enoch Powell. Think Thatcher’s Powellesque warnings about the country being “swamped by people with a different culture”.Give David Cameron his due. He may now be reasonably depicted as the most disastrous prime minister since Anthony Eden, but at least he understood how damaging it was that his party had made itself repellent to growing sections of the electorate. Goaded by research from former deputy party chairman Lord Ashcroft that showed the depth of\u0026nbspminority antipathy to the Tories, he sought to rewrite the narrative – and did so, with some success.In November last year, Paulette Wilson (left), who has lived in the UK for more than half a century, spoke to the \u0027s Amelia Gentleman about her treatment at the hands of the Home Office - and revealed that she had been held at Yarl’s Wood detention centre and threatened with deportation. It was the first of a series of stories that developed a picture of how many members of the Windrush generation were being mistreated by the government under the so-called ‘hostile environment’ policy. By February, with other examples mounting, the government had relented in Wilson’s case, but faced acute criticism from Caribbean diplomats who urged the Home Office to adopt a “more compassionate” approach.In March the story of Albert Thompson - who had lived in Britain for 44 years but was told to produce a passport or face a bill of £54,000 for cancer treatment - forced attention back to the growing crisis. After the  reported a string of additional cases matters came to a head when Theresa May refused to meet with Caribbean diplomats to discuss the issue, prompted fury among opposition MPs and a wider media backlash. After days of negative publicity Rudd and May were forced to change tack and issued apologies, promised reforms - and eventually gave the Windrush generation a fast-track to citizenship.And so we encounter a familiar sight: that of the prime minister and her lieutenants, shovel in hand, frantically digging themselves out of a hole. If you bow at all, bow low, says the Chinese proverb. On Monday the home secretary, Amber Rudd, followed that advice to its extremes. Guaranteed citizenship for any of the mistreated Windrush generation, compensation for their often “heartbreaking” treatment, fees waived, no requirement for applicants to take the obligatory knowledge test on language and life in the UK. A new customer support centre. After months of disdain and indifference to their plight, goodwill abounds.And suddenly the new mood, this government’s cultural glasnost, reaches into other areas. While Rudd bows low, May, fresh from the memorial service marking 25 years since the death of Stephen Lawrence, unveils an annual national day of commemoration for him. Within days, we have lurched from famine to feast.It doesn’t pay to be too cynical. The Windrushers deserve to be fairly treated. , through the reporting of Amelia Gentleman, has been seeking that outcome for months. Of course Stephen Lawrence deserves a day. The commemoration of what the Lawrences and their supporters did for equality and social justice in Britain deserves a slew of days.But what we see is not a government responsive to the public mood, agile in thought, decisive in action, sound in judgment. It’s a study in rush and chaos. There is no method. Its rallying cry is the alarm behind the broken glass. It resists, and when resistance becomes futile, it reacts. Neither position seems the result of much thought. There is no programme, no coherent philosophy, just responses to chatter and evasive action to fend off the impending calamity of the hour, whether by belatedly addressing it or by doing something else to ert attention.Plastic bags, Grenfell, modern slavery, social disparity, housing shortages, apprenticeships: the list of issues the May government has flapped at in a now characteristic half-hearted way grows daily. She promises to tackle racial inequalities. She makes a totem\u0026nbspof it. Next stop, Windrush scandal. Her government cannot buckle down and govern in any measured, coherent sense. It is giddy, confused, arrogant, afraid terrified of threats from a resurgent Labour without and careerist mutineers within – and buffeted throughout its flight by the wild turbulence of Brexit. How can it do anything other than stagger the length of the aircraft applying sticking plasters?Even a prime minister with the appropriate skillset of\u0026nbspvision, efficiency and empathy would struggle. Theresa May, lacking all three, doesn’t stand a chance. The result is what we have witnessed. Her government, until it was shamed by the media and the public, did not\u0026nbsphave the wit or ability to address the Windrush issue\u0026nbspuntil it raged around them – even though it had half a year to see it coming. That should worry us. And\u0026nbspthat failure has widened a chasm between the Tories and the voters they need and should be able to engage with, many of whom now live in Conservative suburban marginals. That really should worry them.• Hugh Muir is associate editor of  Opinion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f4d8d62e675cf49af1dd16f1194c3cd2b12488/0_12_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX29waW5pb25zLnBuZw\u0026amp;s=e362aaf53dd727a7e7211f1e2ca1fdab","title":"minister vows to focus laser like on vice chancellor pay university renumeration","story":"MPs told steps being taken to remove university leaders from renumeration committeesThe universities minister, Sam Gyimah, has pledged to focus “laser-like” on the issue of vice-chancellor pay during questioning from MPs.He was giving evidence to the education select committee as part of its inquiry into value for money in higher education amid mounting concern about the inflated salaries of university leaders and the growing debts burden on graduates.Gyimah told MPs that steps were being taken to remove university leaders from remuneration committees to prevent them setting their own pay.“What happened before was that vice-chancellors sat on the remuneration committee and they would obviously recuse themselves when their own pay was being discussed,” he said. “But even in FTSE 100 companies you can’t sit on a remuneration panel and say: ‘I wasn’t in the room so it’s nothing to do with me.’ They should not be allowed to set their own pay – and that’s action on pay.”The issue of vice-chancellor pay has been a source of growing irritation for the government, which has been accused of not doing enough to cap excessive salaries by many commentators including Labour’s former education minister Andrew Adonis. Last November, Dame Glynis Breakwell announced her resignation as vice-chancellor of the University of Bath after it emerged she earned £475,000 in salary and benefits last year. Gyimah told the committee on Tuesday: “I’m not going to defend vice-chancellor pay. What I have said is that personally I’m intensely relaxed about vice-chancellors earning more than I do as the universities minister. I understand that.“They run large complex organisations and we need people who are capable of doing that. But they are also public institutions. They are in receipt of tax payers’ funds and they should be mindful of that.” research shows that vice-chancellor pay far outstrips that of their peers in senior leadership roles in the public sector, including NHS hospital trusts and local authorities.The £185,000 pay of the chief executive of Birmingham city council – the largest local authority in Europe, with gross annual expenditure of £3bn – was found to be less than half that of the University of Birmingham’s vice-chancellor, Sir David Eastwood, on £378,000.The minister told the committee the newly established Office for Students had “a real focus” on top pay. He added that universities would in future be required to publish the number of staff earning a basic salary of more than £100,000 as part of their audited financial statements, with details of bonuses, pension contributions and taxable benefits of anyone earning more than £150,000. “It’s not just transparency in terms of sharing the numbers, we want to see a justification for the total remuneration package for the head of the provider and the provider’s most senior staff, so they’ve got to explain why that person deserves that pay package.”The committee, including its Conservative chair, Robert Halfon, pressed the minister on continuing deep-seated inequalities in the sector and low graduate salaries.Gyimah acknowledged there were problems within the system and that these were being looked at in the government’s post-18 review. But he defended the continuing value of a degree and claimed that new figures for graduate salaries show “the graduate premium is still strong and still holds”.He told MPs that Department for Education statistics published on Tuesday showed that graduate salaries were holding up, increasing by £1,000 to £33,000 over the course of last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8437dea61cdb7498c64281fb5ca7034241135580/0_136_4511_2707/master/4511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e3dcede59dbae8d8d12dd588edf6cc","title":"jupp heynckes bayern munich confident zidane real madrid","story":"Heynckes came out of retirement six months ago and has steered Bayern to the semi-final as he looks for a record-equalling third Champions League“Nobody had any intention of me being here,” Jupp Heynckes said, sitting at a desk at the Allianz Arena, a microphone tilted towards him, the board behind splattered with sponsors, a card in front saying: “Uefa Champions League”.It turned out he was not finished after all but at 72 this really will be the last time, one more European night in Munich. Six months after being pulled from retirement, called by his old friend Uli Hoeness and asked to coach Bayern for a fourth time, he leads his club into another semi-final. In front of him stands another club with which he has won this competition, Real Madrid.Returning was, Heynckes said then, “a question of the heart”. But if he was coming back, it was to compete. Bayern recovered: the league title is won, the cup awaits and another treble is possible,  as in 2013. “I adore football and, if I do a job, I do it 100 per cent,” he said here. “These are the games you work for and lots of coaches never get the chance to play one of these in their lives. I came back at a very old age and now I have the privilege of being successful again, reaching a semi-final and possibly going through to the final. I am confident.“Football has changed but my style of leadership, my approach, hasn’t. The game has progressed but in the end they are still people out on the pitch, people with different personalities and feelings.”The best example has been James Rodríguez, on loan from Madrid. Bayern will make the deal permanent at the end of the season. “He was a bit down, not in good physical shape either, but I have talked to him a lot and bit by bit his confidence came back. He is more free now and our fans love seeing him play: he has fantastic vision, he’s integrated into the team, happy in Munich. The team that wins the Champions League is the one that is most united.”Toni Kroos, who was part of Bayern’s 2013 Champions League winning team and plays for Madrid, said: “I have the feeling they are much better off with Heynckes. Physically they look to be in good shape, you can see there is a good atmosphere in the team and the whole club.“Heynckes is able to make the collective function the atmosphere within a team is very important. It’s not just about tactical issues it’s also good to keep everyone happy. We’re here to change that a bit.”And that is the thing. For all Heynckes’s confidence, for all that he responded to questions about how he could stop Cristiano Ronaldo by replying, “I might ask you how they can stop Robert Lewandowski,” he was quick to note Madrid are formidable.The chance to win this trophy a third time awaits, something achieved only by Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti. But the team standing before him are Real Madrid and, as Kroos put it, “the Champions League releases special powers” in them. The man occupying the other bench also has a special relationship with this competition and in which he has admitted to feeling he has some kind of guiding “star”.Zinedine Zidane, like Heynckes, is seeking his third European Cup as a manager. It took him 18 months to win two, the first manager in the Champions League era to win consecutive titles it is 20 years since Heynckes first won it, five since his last. In 1998 he won it with Madrid, ending the club’s 32-year wait to be European champions again – “a liberation,” Heynckes called it, although he insisted he had never watched the video. On the other side, playing for Juventus, was Zidane, 27 years his junior.“He is a coach I have maximum respect for, for what he had done at Bayern and at Madrid too,” Zidane said. “He has done great things, he’s admirable. I only have good words for this man. And Bayern is not just a good team, it’s a great club.”The feeling is mutual there was warmth in Heynckes’s words. “I have played against great players and coaches: Sacchi, Cruyff, Lippi, Happel and I have always been a great admirer of Zinedine Zidane as a player and a coach,” he said. “I love how Real Madrid play and his calmness on the touchline, not making a big fuss, not playing to the gallery or the TV cameras. For 90 minutes he follows what is happening on the pitch.”There is something more than finance, Heynckes noted, something deeper that has revived. And while he was clearly enjoying this, there was also a sense of vindication and his line sounded perhaps more pointed when it is considered these teams, though no paupers, faced Paris Saint-Germain this season and, unlike the French champions, are still there. “A team has to respect itself, have human qualities. You can’t buy the Champions League,” he said. You cannot buy moments like this either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c365a51f70b5dd39240ad42d2d776277df84349f/0_4_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa5e6cbdebc0873886dcb59f8b172610","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool roma mo salah di francesco barcelona","story":"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool will withstand another Roma recovery next week after seizing control of their Champions League semi-final with a brilliant performance illuminated by the “world class” Mohamed Salah.The Egypt forward haunted his former club with two exquisite goals, taking his tally for the season to 43, and two assists as Liverpool swept into a 5-0 lead over Roma before conceding two late goals.A 5-2 result means Roma must reprise their remarkable comeback against Barcelona in the quarter-finals to deny Liverpool a place in the Champions League final in Kiev on 26 May. But Klopp, his mood soured by the probable loss of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for the rest of the season through injury, insisted his prolific, devastating team will be ready for a backlash at the Stadio Olimpico next Wednesday.“Since I arrived Liverpool has always had to take the more difficult way but in the end Liverpool always succeeded and that’s what we have to do again,” Klopp said. “If one of my players doesn’t think Roma will try to come back, then he will not play.”Lucky to get away with pushing first-half Kolarov effort on to his bar otherwise relatively quiet\u0026nbsp6Another nerveless performance from the teenager, given space to push on\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspStrong defensively, struck Roma’s bar just before half-time.

We made one mistake and the ref made one mistake and that was two goals for them. We take the penalty.“We have to work again in Rome, that is no problem. There would have been work to do if we won 5-0 because Roma would do everything to strike back. What I learned tonight is that we can win the second leg too. Roma need to score against us and we are not Barcelona. Barcelona is one of the two or three best teams in the world and won so many things in the last few years.

The first goal is just a genius strike, he scored already a few like this which makes clear it is no coincidence. The second is brilliant play, Bobby Firmino between the lines and he makes the pass and then Mo makes the other two goals.“If anyone wants to say it is my mistake that we concede the two goals because I change the striker, I have no problem with that. Mo was running all the time and it would not have helped us if he gets an injury. What a player. If you think he is the best in the world, write it or say it. He is in outstandingly good shape, world-class shape, but to be the best in the world you need to do it over a longer period, I think. The other two are not bad.”Eusebio Di Francesco said memories of the three-goal comeback against Barcelona would give Roma hope for the second leg.“Let me remind you once again the tie is not over, and we have proved it,” the manager said. “We have shown we can come back.

If any of my players does not believe we can win, they can stay away from the second leg.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d67d6ad2842e0f8095cb7370ce77978e9054a62/289_53_3026_1816/master/3026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92ad1af432d2485d791f2d946e10bc1e","title":"liverpool roma champions league semi final first leg match report 5 2","story":"Of all the mesmerising nights Liverpool have experienced under Anfield’s floodlights in the European competitions, where does this one stand? Up there, surely, with Saint-Étienne in 1977, Olympiakos in 2005, the fightback against Borussia Dortmund in 2016 and all the other famous occasions. Liverpool have added another exhilarating one to an already extensive list and, barring an almost implausible feat of escapology from Roma, can start looking forward to the final in Ukraine on 26 May.The only possible note of caution is that Roma have already overcome a 4-1 first-leg deficit in the Stadio Olimpico against Barcelona in the quarter-finals. On that basis Jürgen Klopp was entitled to be dismayed by his team’s carelessness when they had a 5-0 lead. Yet perhaps the manager miscalculated by withdrawing Mohamed Salah, who had scored twice and set up two of the others. Roma promptly scored two of their own and, somehow, a hitherto rampant Liverpool side had to endure a nervous climax against reinvigorated opponents.Ultimately, though, it was another triumphant night for Liverpool – a scintillating performance, for the most part – and Klopp’s team will head to Italy for the return in a position of strength. True, it might not have been the position they anticipated when they led by five goals and were threatening to add even more. Yet it was a smile on Klopp’s face at the final whistle. Liverpool might have been disappointed not to inflict a quick kill but they have inflicted grievous damage and, on this evidence, they should be confident about adding more goals when the sides meet again on Wednesday week.Roma played well for the opening 20 minutes and found some new momentum in the final quarter of an hour. In between, however, Serie A’s third-placed side looked in need of smelling salts. Liverpool attacked from every angle. The din was extraordinary and Salah had such a hold on the match that it felt almost like a trick of the mind to realise that the fifth goal, when Roberto Firmino headed in James Milner’s corner, did not have the Egyptian’s fingerprints all over it.Lucky to get away with pushing first-half Kolarov effort on to his bar otherwise relatively quiet\u0026nbsp6Another nerveless performance from the teenager, given space to push on\u0026nbsp7\u0026nbspStrong defensively, struck Roma’s bar just before half-time.

Later provided good support to score the third goal\u0026nbsp7Ratings by Paul WilsonAt that stage, with 69 minutes gone, it would not have been a surprise if Liverpool had emulated, or even bettered, the seven goals that Manchester United scored past Roma in the 2007 quarter-finals. Instead there was a strange and unexpected end to a wild and eccentric evening. There has never been a semi-final in the Champions League with more goals and, if nothing else, at least Roma kept the tie alive with their late show of resistance. Yet the point remains that Liverpool ought to be enthralled with their night’s work.In the process Salah scored his 42nd and 43rd goals of the season. Sadio Mané added another to his personal collection and Roberto Firmino scored two of his own. Together, those three have accumulated 87 goals this season. Mané’s finishing might have been erratic sometimes but he quickly realised he had the beating of Federico Fazio, the former Tottenham Hotspur reserve. Firmino rarely disappoints on the big occasions and for long spells it was difficult not to pity Eusebio Di Francesco’s team. Roma were taking an almighty chasing.Encouraged by early save from Salah, but given little chance by the same player twice before half-time 6Former Tottenham player was solid in the air, adventurous on the ground when going forward\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspGreece international was caught out of position when Firmino slipped Salah through for second goal\u0026nbsp6Booked when surprised by Mané’s pace, not a success at stopping Salah, a night to forget\u0026nbsp5Not given time to\u0026nbspplay his usual game, the midfielder struggled to handle Liverpool’s pace\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspEarly shot saved but the Netherlands international possibly at fault for second Liverpool goal\u0026nbsp6Could have opened the scoring but rarely made it as far forward again\u0026nbsp6The 20-year-old\u0026nbspTurk was anonymous until being takenoff at half-time\u0026nbspfor Schick\u0026nbsp5Always willing to receive the ball, even under pressure. Some good touches and close control\u0026nbsp7Not his most impressive game, often stationed too wide to cause trouble, but took goal well\u0026nbsp7Ratings by Paul Wilson\u0026nbspMore than anyone, it was another night to savour the little guy with the magic in his feet and enough manners to hold up his palms in front of the away end to apologise for his first-half goals. Salah scored 34 times in 83 appearances for Roma but this performance was another reminder that he operates now at a different level.His first goal was a peach – a curling, diagonal shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar – but the second was not too shabby either. Firmino slipped the pass through the middle and once Salah reached the ball first there was a sense of inevitability about what would happen next – a touch to steady himself, a quick look up and then an impudent chip over Alisson, the Roma goalkeeper, almost in slow motion.When Manchester City came here in the quarter-finals Liverpool inflicted the damage with a blitz of three goals before half-time. This time they restricted themselves to Salah’s double but one of the more attractive traits of this side is that, when they are in a winning position, they always go looking for more goals. Another team might have prioritised a clean sheet in the second half. Liverpool, on the other hand, sensed a rout, attacking from every angle, with Salah at the hub of everything.Perhaps, in the end, that sense of adventure cost them but it was difficult to be too critical when they had scored five and could also reflect on the chances that Mané missed, the header that Dejan Lovren thudded against the crossbar and the times when Salah slalomed round his former team-mates. Salah left Juan Jesus for dead to set up Firmino’s first goal. Jesus, Roma’s left-sided centre-half, had to be substituted midway through the second half and Aleksandar Kolarov, the former Manchester City defender, did not have the speed or agility to keep up with the newly crowned Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year. Even by Salah’s standards, this was an exceptional performance of skill, sophistication and big-game expertise.All of which made it perplexing that Klopp removed his chief tormentor in the 75th minute. Liverpool lost their momentum and Lovren’s mistake let Edin Dzeko pull one back before the substitute Diego Perotti added another from the penalty spot, capitalising on Milner’s handball.The only other downside for Liverpool was the knee injury suffered by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in a challenge with Kolarov in the first half. The midfielder was taken off on a stretcher with his season hanging in the balance. Indeed, Oxlade-Chamberlain seemed so badly hurt there have to be serious concerns he would miss the Champions League final if his team-mates finish the job. Klopp, of course, did not want to be so presumptuous but surely Liverpool will not blow it from this position."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0946b6fa6ffdc7a14dd8e6152e5ca6d2ded288/194_412_5086_3051/master/5086.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=830495273cb7ecb318e9dd4672a34bdf","title":"majestic mohamed salah liverpool roma champions league semi final","story":"Ten minutes before half-time on a wild night of Champions League football Mohamed Salah did perhaps the best thing so far of the many wonderful things contained in his dreamy first Liverpool season.By that stage Anfield was in one of those periods of constant uproar, jiggled and tickled and dragged into a state of intoxication as Liverpool battered away at Roma without drawing breath. It is no secret this Liverpool team play in surges, moments when the day seems to turn a shade of deep red and when the front three become a whirl of malevolent action.But this was something new. Liverpool and Salah did not just accelerate away from Roma, they eviscerated them, almost but not quite killing a semi-final that remains, somehow, in the balance.Liverpool were relentless in those periods, shaking and ragging Roma in their jaws like a terrier with an old leather slipper.

Another 3-0 win would do the job this time too. But then, Roma will also have to face Salah again, with bruises still fresh from a beating that came in high-speed waves.Salah was that rare thing, an athlete at the top of his profession finding new heights, new levels. There may be a more breathtakingly brilliant attacking performance in Europe this season but, given the game and the stage, there has not been one yet.Encouraged by early save from Salah, but given little chance by the same player twice before half-time 6Former Tottenham player was solid in the air, adventurous on the ground when going forward\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspGreece international was caught out of position when Firmino slipped Salah through for second goal\u0026nbsp6Booked when surprised by Mané’s pace, not a success at stopping Salah, a night to forget\u0026nbsp5Not given time to\u0026nbspplay his usual game, the midfielder struggled to handle Liverpool’s pace\u0026nbsp6\u0026nbspEarly shot saved but the Netherlands international possibly at fault for second Liverpool goal\u0026nbsp6Could have opened the scoring but rarely made it as far forward again\u0026nbsp6The 20-year-old\u0026nbspTurk was anonymous until being takenoff at half-time\u0026nbspfor Schick\u0026nbsp5Always willing to receive the ball, even under pressure.

Salah took the ball inside the penalty area found himself with a tiny pocket of space. With a shift of feet he looked up and produced with no real backlift a shot that did something extraordinary, the ball seeming to hang under the lights, generating a strange moment of hush as it arced under the bar before crashing down over the line.It was the first cut in a sublime 15-minute spell for Salah. Best of all it came after a bitty, angsty start. For the opening quarter this had been a different kind of match as Roma’s calmness on the ball, their physical power and the loss of momentum caused by a serious injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took the crackle out of the air.Liverpool found their ignition in the 26th minute, sparked by a hacking foul on Mané. At which point: welcome to the Red Zone. It was Salah who provided the assassin’s eye but this was a team surge, a spell of pure, fast murder ball. First Mané missed a glorious chance after some lovely deft work by Firmino. And steadily Salah began to skate in from the left-hand side, playing now in his own clear pool of light, isolating Juan Jesus as Roma left their centre-half to face an unwinnable one on one.The goals were coming, hammering at the walls, moaning through the keyhole. If that thumping shot to make it 1-0 brought Anfield to its feet, the finish for Salah’s second before half-time was something different. Again it was Firmino with the sweet approach play, on a night that left Salah up there with Cristiano Ronaldo as the top scorer in the Champions League this season. But this time Salah’s finish was a caress, a dink over Alisson that drew coos and gurgles in among the roars.What to say about him now, in a season that just keeps on soaring up through the clouds? It is easy to forget this was a pointed occasion for Salah personally, newly crowned as the player of the year and now facing the biggest club game of his career against his former employers: unarguably the star, against an opponent forewarned and prepared.In the event the Salah Spring just keeps rolling, with 22 goals and nine assists in his past 19 starts since Boxing Day. More significant than the numbers is the spectacle, the basic joy in Salah’s free-running interpretation of the inside-forward role, a combination of preternatural quick feet, a computer of a creative brain and the rare ability in modern football simply to make the game up in front of him.Salah was too much for Roma as he has been for so many others this season. Defensive jitters may have let Roma back in towards the end but Liverpool will travel to Rome with confidence. Jürgen Klopp has spoken about the need for everyone to join “the train”, for the whole team to push it along together. The Olympic Stadium will be a moment to yank the throttle hard once again, to keep that machine driving on right to the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac641d828e9bc8df493beb5ad47e10ef105f87dd/358_241_2468_1481/master/2468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faed8ce7a2951a28723cba7d4aa172f5","title":"liverpool v roma champions league semi final first leg live","story":"Liverpool screamed into a five-goal lead in thrilling style, and then took Mo Salah off and wobbledAnd that’s all from me.

We were in trouble, and we lost our unity. We kept a good attitude until the end.”Here’s Jürgen Klopp – “The boys did fantastically well, and we go there and try to win again”:For a long time it was a perfect performance, for 80 minutes or so. We made defensively one mistake, and Dzeko can use the situation. That can happen. We knew they had quality. We could avoid most of that over the game, but in that position not. Then I think we agree the penalty is not a penalty, not even a handball*, and now it’s 5-2. I would be much more happy of course if we’d won 5-0 or 5-1, but it’s still a fantastic result, I couldn’t even imagine that it’s possible. The boys did fantastically well, and we go there and try to win again.You start the game, you always need to learn from the game. I thought how we played them, all these runs in behind, just brilliant. In the end, it changed the game completely. We scored these goals, we could have scored more. We missed a lot of chances. That’s all positive. In the moment it feels not that positive because they scored two goals. But it was brilliant, come on. We obviously have to go the hard way, no problem with that. At the end it’s hard. Oxlade-Chamberlain, it’s probably a really bad injury, if we can say that already. That means a massive blow for us. We have still a few massive games to go, and the squad doesn’t get bigger. We need to be creative in the next few games. It’s absolutely better than I thought before the game.Of all the mesmerising nights Liverpool have experienced under Anfield’s floodlights in European competition, where does this one stand? Up there, surely, with Saint-Étienne in 1977, the take-a-bow goal from Steven Gerrard against Olympiakos in 2005 and the fightback against Borussia Dortmund in 2016. Liverpool have put themselves in command and, barring an almost implausible feat of escapology, can start looking forward to the final in Ukraine on 26 May.Here’s the rest of Daniel Taylor’s match report:I think we’ll be disappointed with the two goals. It felt as though we were in full control and we basically gave them two goals. At the same time we’ve played well, we’ve won the game. We’ll go with a three-goal advantage but it’ll be difficult, as we saw in the last round. It’ll be a really tough challenge, but we’ve got to be confident. We’ve got to go there, put a solid display on and hopefully get to the final. We still had chances to score in the final 20 minutes. I feel as though we gave them the Dzeko goal, which caused a few nerves. The penalty I thought was very, very harsh. But we’ve got to stay confident. It was a good performance for 70 minutes. We’ve got to go there and put in a good performance.Some of the runs and some of the balls in behind were brilliant. We’re probably disappointed not to score more. Overall, we’ve got to stay positive. We know it won’t be easy over there. We need to be on our best, but I fancy us to go there and score as well, with the forward players we’ve got. That was a classic first leg, fascinating and often brutal. Liverpool end disappointed with a three-goal lead – it’ll be interesting to hear Klopp’s post-match take.“It is hard to be a Liverpool fan,” writes Richard McGahey. “Can we get Mourinho to be our coach for the last 15 minutes of games?”The final 15 minutes was poor from Liverpool. Salah, assuming there are no injury concerns, was taken off too early, they relaxed too soon and Roma punished them. Surely, though, they’ll score the goal they need in Rome?90+4 mins: The end of a remarkable game.90+2 mins: Liverpool’s final substitution sees Firmino slowly go off, and Klavan slowly come on.90+1 mins: Into the first of four minutes of stoppage time. Fazio heads the corner wide.90 mins: Nainggolan’s shot is deflected wide, and Roma have a corner.90 mins: That penalty decision was harsh. The ball was blasted at Milner, he had no chance to get his arm out of the way, and there was no movement towards the ball.88 mins: Fazio is booked for being angry and emotional. Henderson was also booked a couple of minutes ago, probably for similar reasons.87 mins: Dzeko now takes the ball down the left and fizzes the ball in, but Perotti turns it wide of the near post!86 mins: Now Dzeko’s long-range strike dips just over the bar! What’s going on out there?Perotti sends Karius the wrong way, and sends the ball into the top corner, and this tie is not over!85 min: A cross from the left is headed out to Nainggolan, whose first-time shot hits Milner. The referee says it hit his hand, and it was deliberate!84 mins: Dzeko has another shot, but it’s weak and easily saved. Liverpool, though, are having a bad spell, and another Roma goal would be bad news.82 mins: Wijnaldum should have scored a sixth! The ball is passes into him by Robertson, and he only needed to sidefoot goalwards – but he uses his right foot rather than his left, and misses it entirely.82 mins: That is very nicely taken.And there’s the away goal! Nainggolan lifts the ball into the area, Lovren totally misses his header and Dzeko chests down, and slams in.78 mins: Roma know that their only chance in this tie is to score at least one away goal, and that they might as well lose 6-0 as 5-0, and are thus pushing forward.77 mins: “I backed Liverpool 5-0 at 45-1. Can they stop now?” wonders Ian Bruce. Good call.76 mins: Ings is played in down the right, and tries to cut back onto his left foot. He’s been watching too much Mo Salah. A defender gets a foot in the way.75 mins: Strootman, victim of that Lovren tackle, is limping but has to play on, with Roma having used all their substitutions. “Luckily for Liverpool supporters like myself West Brom didn’t make it to the semi-finals of the Champions League,” notes Bryan Tisinger.75 mins: Lovren is booked, and Salah is hooked. Ings is on.74 mins: Wijnaldum has attempted the same clever 360-degree turn three times. It worked the first time, but not since.73 mins: Save! Perotti’s fine cross from the left is met by Schick, who comfortably beats Robertson in the air, but Karius saves the header.73 mins: Liverpool are going to bring on Danny Ings. Word is that Salah will be the one to go off.71 mins: Lovren’s clearance hits Schick and rebounds, to his very great relief, just wide of goal. “It’s partly the time of year, and the colours of the respective team’s kits, but this is reminiscent of a truly sociopathic 5-0 dissection of Nottingham Forest by the home team, back when both clubs were at the summit,” writes Paul Griffin. “Some great, physically and mentally resilient footballers getting the Patrick Bateman treatment out there.”70 mins: Roma send in a succession of crosses, without any of them quite falling their way inside the penalty area. Still, vaguely nervous moments for the home defence.69 mins: That’s two goals and* Actually it was Milner who took this cornerFrom the corner, Firmino’s headed bounces into the far corner!68 mins: Gonalons’ first touch is a massively overhit pass that gifts Liverpool a corner.66 mins: Roma make a double substitution: Gonalons comes on for De Rossi, and Perotti comes on for Jesus.66 mins: Milner arrives late to challenge Strootman, who in trying to get out of the way plants his studs on Milner. Whose foul was it? Milner’s says the referee.64 mins: Liverpool win a corner. It’s not a great delivery from Salah, but Alisson comes for it and, unchallenged, fumbles. Liverpool can’t take advantage of the mistake, though."},{"url":null,"title":"dog breed dna genome genetic testing","story":"A writer es into at-home dog DNA testing to learn all she can about her pooch – and so that know-it-alls will stop pestering her at the dog parkEveryone thinks my dog is a puppy. His large, wide-set eyes small, soft body and playful demeanor belie his maturity and emotional depth – attributes that become obvious once you get to know him. The truth is he’s about four, though the exact date of his birth, like that of many rescue dogs, is lost. He looks, to my eye, like some sort of a labrador-terrier mix, with a soulful amber gaze, spunky little foldy ears, and an itty-bitty little nosey. He is my friend and I love him.Until recently, though, his age and breed were up for debate. This was evidenced by an apparent dog expert at the local dog park on a recent morning. “No,” he said, shaking his head, after asking for the details of my dog. “My dog looked like that when she was a puppy, and now she looks like this.” He gestured to his large pit-bull-looking sweetie who, though beautiful, looked nothing like my little labrador-looking sweetie whom I love so much and for whom I would die. “Well … he’s about four,” I told him, hiding my annoyance well as I am extremely calm. “No. I don’t think so,” he said.The main reason I wanted to DNA test my dog was to shove the results in this rude man’s goddamn rude face, wherever he is. Probably hell!At-home dog DNA testing was made possible after the dog genome was sequenced in 2005 from the DNA of a female boxer named Tasha. Thank you, Tasha. This information provided a jumping-off point to map the genomes of other dog breeds and their markers of genetic diseases, as well as some stuff about human diseases that frankly I do not think I should be the one to explain to you you may read about it here.“Of the more than 5,500 mammals living today, dogs are arguably the most remarkable,” said Eric Lander, senior author of the dog genome sequencing study and professor of biology at MIT. Agree. “The incredible physical and behavioral ersity of dogs – from chihuahuas to great danes – is encoded in their genomes. It can uniquely help us understand embryonic development, neurobiology, human disease, and the basis of evolution.” Wild stuff.For my at-home dog DNA test I picked Embark, which puts to use “over 20 times more genetic information than any other test on the market”, says Embark. The company uses more than 200,000 genetic markers to establish your dog’s breed, or breed mix, and more than 175 genetic health and trait tests to establish whether your dog is at risk for or a carrier of genetic disease. I chose Embark because I was not paying for it and it was the most expensive option ($189). Of the many tests currently on the market, Embark’s main competitor is Wisdom Panel 4.0 ($84.99), which only uses 2,000 genetic markers. Yeah, right. DNA My Dog ($68.98), the next-most-popular according to lists, doesn’t even give you a number of genetic markers it uses. Please.Embark’s kit comes with a swab. You hold the swab to the inside of your dog’s cheek for a few seconds, which they dislike very much, and then you put it into the sample tube, and then you send it back. They get the results to you in about two months, which is so long.May I tell you more about my dog? I’d like to, if you have a few hours. No? OK, I’ll make it slightly quicker. His name is Peter. Typically the more soft-hearted of humanity will, upon learning that his name is Peter, grasp their chest in delicious agony, as “Peter” is such a sweet name for such a gentle dog. Peter. The name came from Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, where I adopted him they give all of their dogs celebrity or otherwise famous names and his given name was “Peter Parker”. The “Peter” just seemed right. Peter.Before he was at Badass, he was a stray in south-east Georgia. The stray dog population is very large there, so Badass makes regular trips to bring back dogs to be adopted in New York. Peter was taken to a small kill shelter in a town called Mt Vernon, a place from which the Sweet Onion Animal Protection Society (Soaps) regularly tries to remove as many dogs as they can before the dogs are euthanized, to be placed into foster care and eventually adopted.While awaiting the results of Peter’s DNA test, I reached out to the Soaps director, Therisa Ingley, to see if the organization had any information about his pre-Brooklyn life. It had a little:“When Badass was visiting last February, we visited the shelter and they fell in love with Peter Parker. He had been picked up as a stray and had been there for awhile,” she said. “Very few dogs from shelters get adopted here because there are just so many. Badass fell in love with his gentle nature and he was pulled to go back with them.”He lived for about three years before I knew him. It really kills me that I was not able to protect him during that time, and that I’ll never really know what his life was like. However, I plan to teach him how to talk and I will update you once he tells me.Oh, you would like to know even more about Peter? If you insist. He has velvet ears. He has a spotted tongue. When he walks down the stairs, at his moderately paced gentleman’s trot, you can tell he’s a bit bow-legged. He has the heart of an angel and the soul of a poet, and there’s a hint of sadness to him that makes you want to protect him against all of the world’s harshness. He has whiskers that are so prominent they make you second-guess whether whiskers are a typical dog trait, or whether he could potentially be part mouse. He will sit his big, fat butt on your lap like he’s tiny, when he is actually 25 pounds. He’s affectionate, but not needy. “He’s just so … kind,” is how a cousin of mine once described him, and it’s true: he’s just so kind. Also he loves to burrow under the covers, and he loves to sleep with his head on a pillow like a tiny little man.I wanted to know what he was because I want to know everything I can about him, and because I wanted to shove it in the face of any goddamn rude know-it-all men I came across in the future. But was there any other reason to get his DNA tested? I reached out to Ann Hohenhaus, staff doctor at New York City’s Animal Medical Center, to ask.“Well, I think that it depends,” she said. “You can use DNA testing for a lot of things. One thing is for fun.” (Meaning to find out what kind of a little sweetie my dog is.) “The second is that we’ve been using DNA tests in dogs for a long time to diagnose specific diseases … With a particular breed and a particular set of clinical signs, a DNA test may be a very efficient way to make a diagnosis in a patient.”While I was impatiently awaiting the results of my DNA test, this haunted me. What if the DNA test told me Peter was sick? He didn’t seem sick. But what if maybe he was going to be sick in the future? I also worried about how I would write around it in this piece. Maybe I would attempt to feature it as a poignant look at the impermanence of life, but, in contrast, the permanence of love – how his love will always be with me, and mine with him, no matter what. Luckily I do not have to travel down this thought-provoking road, because after six agonizing weeks of waiting, I received Peter’s impressive results:Peter tested clear for the 165 genetic conditions for which Embark scans, including 28 that are common in his breed mix, like congenital hypothyroidism, progressive retinal atrophy, and muscular dystrophy. Huh. “Not even at risk for any of them?” I wondered. “Did I do it wrong?” I wondered. “Is this wrong?” I asked Dr Hohenhaus.“I’m not surprised your dog was negative for those diseases, because those genetic diseases don’t occur very often in mixed-breed dogs,” she said. Oh. “That’s not to say they never do – I’ve diagnosed genetic disease in a mixed-breed dog. The disease normally occurred in the springer iel and this dog was a black-and-white shorthaired thing, and it had the same genetic mutation. But that’s the only time I’ve ever done that. So, it occurs but it’s rare.”Still, she said, there could be danger in taking negative results of the at-home swab test as gospel. The tests typically look for a single mutation, and if your dog’s disease (say pyruvate kinase deficiency, which has several mutations across different breeds) has a mutation that hasn’t been discovered yet – even if he presents symptoms that would be obvious to a veterinarian – the test won’t catch it. Plus, a cheek swab test means a bacteria-laden sample: “When I do DNA testing, I take a blood sample and send it in. And a blood sample is inherently ‘cleaner’, in quotes, than if you do a home DNA test with a cheek swab,” Honenhaus told me. “So that test has some inherent issues, because you have the DNA of the bacteria in the dog’s mouth along with the dog’s DNA, in that sample. And so I think that there is probably an opportunity for a sample that’s harder to read if there’s a lot of bacteria in the mouth. So, DNA testing labs, I’m certain, would prefer to have a blood sample. I think really the at-home DNA testing is not as much for disease as it is for the fun.”Yes, this checks out. Mostly what you’re looking for when you’re giving your dog a DNA test you ordered from the internet, I believe, is the fun of finding out the fun little mystery of who he is. Speaking of the fun little mystery of who he is, do you want to know what my dog is? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you ready? Here, look at this photo of him so you can guess before you know:Do you have your guess? OK. Here it is:He is, as you can see, so many things. Peter. (A “supermutt” means, according to Embark, that there may be “small amounts of DNA from these distant ancestors”: chow chow, dalmatian, and miniature pinscher.) Here he is. The basic structure of a labrador retriever. The smaller stature of a chihuahua. The intelligent, calm demeanor of a golden retriever. The love for burrowing of the small-prey hunter dachshund. The wide-set eyes and expressive ears of a rat terrier. The sociability of the miniature schnauzer. The wide chest and slightly bowed back legs of the American staffordshire terrier. The spotted tongue of the chow chow.He is, according to the test, about 36 in people years – roughly four years old.I asked Dr Hohenhaus if there was anything practical to be gleaned from learning the breeds that go into a mutt, and she wasn’t sure the evidence was out there – yet. “I think that two years from now you’ll write a different article than you’ll write today. Because this is an area of expansion and growth, and we’ll know better how to use the fact that your dog, although he only weighs 25lb, is part labrador, we’ll know better how to use that information,” she said.I look forward to this day. But for now, at least I know how I’ll use this information: against rude men who think they know more about my dog than I do at the dog park.Looking for more great work from the Outline, an online publication focused on power, culture, and the future?

I\u0026nbspfired more than 250 people. They were dark days: we’d be invited to dinner somewhere and my wife would say to me: ‘Don’t tell anyone what you do for a\u0026nbspliving.’”What ignoble occupation had Sundin chosen? Arms dealer? Cigarette manufacturer? CEO of Enron? Not quite: he was the head of Universal Music’s Nordic operation. The “disaster” he was talking about was working for a\u0026nbsprecord label when CD sales were in\u0026nbspdecline.Sundin’s fatalistic outlook was reflected across the music industry. Despite the fact that artists such as Adele and Rihanna were selling millions of records, music companies seemed perennially glum. As revenues declined, they lashed out, fighting legal battles with teenagers who illegally downloaded music and investing in propaganda campaigns to try to teach pesky young people the value of intellectual property. At one point, they worked with the animator Aardman to create a\u0026nbspfree iPhone game called Music Inc, where you attempt to manage a\u0026nbspband, but always fail because of online\u0026nbsppiracy.For decades, a\u0026nbspjob in music had been some of the most fun you could have as an adult. Labels were charging up to £20 for a CD, raking in hundreds of millions of pounds. And they typically received the lion’s share. When Guy Hands, a private equity manager, arrived at EMI in 2007, he wondered why hundreds of thousands of pounds were being spent on floral arrangements until he realised that “fruit and flowers” was accounting slang for drugs, sex workers and other items otherwise difficult to put on an expenses claim. Parties, hedonism and drug use were part of the job.Then, in the space of a\u0026nbspdecade, the music industry essentially collapsed\u0026nbsp– in the US, music’s biggest market, annual revenues fell from $14.6bn in 1999 to $6.3bn in 2009. Some artists still did OK, particularly those who focused on live shows, merchandise and brand endorsements, but labels had to dramatically cut costs. At EMI, Hands did away with the slush fund as well as almost half the workforce. At the label Per Sundin ran, the majority of the team was laid off. The expense accounts, the marketing budgets, the joy of taking a\u0026nbsppunt on a\u0026nbspweird band of misfits in the hope something magical might happen\u0026nbsp– it was all over. Chart music became safer the bestselling records of the 2010s have all been by middle-of-the-road acts with lots of “nan appeal”: Adele, Ed Sheeran, Michael Bublé and Take\u0026nbspThat.So does that mean we’re back to the glory days of Britpop, private jets and swimming pools full of cocaine? It doesn’t seem that way. There is money sloshing around, but it is not ending up in the places you might expect. Certain genres of music and types of artist are experiencing a\u0026nbspboom, while others remain destitute. It’s a\u0026nbspworld where Nordic cloud-rappers and South American reggaeton artists are watching their bank balances grow, whereas young, hyped guitar bands are struggling.The balance of power has shifted in all kinds of unexpected ways. What has happened, in the space of a\u0026nbspcouple of years, is the biggest change to the industry since the launch of\u0026nbspNapster. Where is all the money ending up? “Five years ago, the kinds of artists we work with wouldn’t see a\u0026nbsppenny until their album came out\u0026nbsp– and even then the album would have to do really well to make any money back,” says Sahil Varma, who works in A\u0026ampR for a mid-sized London based independent label, 37 Adventures. “Now, you’re making money from day\u0026nbspone.”He gives the example of Jones, a soulful singer-songwriter signed to the label. She is not a big artist she plays mid-sized venues in London and her debut album failed to make the Top 200. But on Spotify she has been streamed more than 70m times. “That equates to revenue of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Five years ago, with such low sales, she would have been dropped the week after her album came out. Brands have started looking at Spotify plays, too, so she is doing some stuff with Barbour. Now she has a\u0026nbspsteady income.” Varma says there are thousands of artist like Jones, who just a\u0026nbspfew years ago would have had to get other\u0026nbspjobs.This was always the promise of the streaming revolution. When Spotify launched in 2008, it pledged to defeat music piracy and ensure that artists got paid for their music\u0026nbsp– but it quickly emerged that what they were willing to pay artists was a\u0026nbspcouple of thousandths of a\u0026nbsppenny for each stream. There is a\u0026nbspbig debate over exactly how many thousandths\u0026nbsp– the latest survey by Digital Music News suggests that Apple Music pays $0.00783 and Spotify pays $0.00397. However, Rolling Stone has reported that artists and labels with greater clout in the industry are getting better rates. When I\u0026nbspask Tim Dellow, at the indie label Transgressive (home to Foals and Flume), he says that they are “on a\u0026nbsppar” with the majors. What remains true is that the biggest artists will have more favourable deals with their labels, allowing them to see a\u0026nbspbigger percentage of royalties, just as in the CD\u0026nbspera.Whatever the specifics, we are talking about tiny amounts of money, especially compared with CD sales. Initially, artists revolted, with, for example, Thom Yorke removing his solo album The Eraser from Spotify in 2013, after its producer, Nigel Godrich, complained the service favoured established acts and didn’t support new artists. Some of the biggest artists in the world\u0026nbsp– Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyoncé\u0026nbsp– followed suit, withholding their releases from streaming platforms either temporarily or indefinitely. Smaller artists signed to big labels were essentially powerless to choose whether their music went on to the service or not, and complained that labels were raking in big profits from Spotify while artists were seeing\u0026nbspscraps.But, over time, it has become clear that the fraction of a\u0026nbsppenny you receive from a\u0026nbspstream can’t be seen in the same context as the royalty on a CD sale. The money an artist made from a\u0026nbspphysical album was a\u0026nbspone-off payment within weeks of it being released, this revenue frequently dried\u0026nbspup.On Spotify, every time a listener wants to play the song, the artist gets a\u0026nbsptiny bit of money. If a\u0026nbsplistener adds the song to one of their own playlists, that can mean it will be repeatedly revisited over a\u0026nbsplifetime. If it gets added to one of Spotify’s curated mood playlists – Acoustic Spring, for example – the artist can expect tens of millions of plays. Acts whose biggest hits came well before the streaming era are banking huge new revenues from their existing catalogue. Fleetwood Mac have 11\u0026nbspmillion monthly listeners that’s more than Stormzy, George Ezra or Harry Styles. They will collect a\u0026nbsphuge cheque every month without doing\u0026nbspanything.There are ways to exploit the system, too. “Almost every track we release, we then release in an acoustic version a\u0026nbspfew weeks later,” says Varma. “The acoustic version will end up on different playlists to the main version\u0026nbsp– ones such as Sunday Chilled, and often it will get more\u0026nbspstreams.”Some bigger artists have taken this “moneyball” approach to extremes. Not content with the 1.7bn streams his song Shape of You has had on the site, Ed Sheeran released an acoustic version (74m streams), a\u0026nbspreggaeton version for the Latin market (69m), a\u0026nbspversion with a Stormzy verse (50m), a Major Lazer version for dancehall playlists (48m) and three further dance remixes (32m streams).When just the remixes of one Sheeran song get more streams than some artists will have in their entire career, you can see why big labels are excited. Analysts say the biggest artists, such as Sheeran and Drake, have received in excess of $50m from Spotify before other streaming services are factored in. Sheeran’s label, Warner music, took $1.3bn from streaming alone last\u0026nbspyear.“Our catalogue has become so much more valuable,” says Alec Boateng, the co-head of A\u0026ampR at Atlantic Records. “That means we’ve got more money swirling around the whole company, allowing us to invest pretty heavily in A\u0026ampR and\u0026nbspdevelopment. We’re patient with artists – and being patient can be expensive. The new income makes us feel a\u0026nbspbit more comfortable spending time working with an artist to develop\u0026nbspthem.”The way that A\u0026ampRs are finding new artists is changing, too. Today, every major label has at least one analytics expert, whose job it is to follow trends on the streaming platforms and flag up any unsigned artists who are performing well. It means that a\u0026nbspkid from nowhere who uploads a\u0026nbspsong to Spotify that does well can find every label in the world descending on them, trying to sign a\u0026nbspdeal.“If you walked into any major label meeting this week, the thing they’d be talking about is how ‘Spotify-friendly’ an artist is,” says Varma. “By that, they mean: can they get on Spotify’s playlists, such as New Pop Revolution or Chilled Pop?” Artists such as Nils Frahm, a\u0026nbsprelatively obscure German composer, gets more than 2.5m monthly streams from appearing on playlists such as Peaceful Piano and Songs for\u0026nbspSleeping.Music used to be dominated by audiences with the most spending power\u0026nbsp– so middle-class, middle-aged people, buying albums at Tesco as part of their weekly shop, often decided what topped the charts. Now, Afrobeat, Danish rap, hundreds of genres of niche electronic music and particularly British urban music are flourishing commercially, without having to make any concessions to the\u0026nbspmainstream.“Before, you had to get on mainstream radio, have a\u0026nbspcertain style or sound,” says Boateng. “It’s allowing for a\u0026nbspmore erse proposition for British music and a\u0026nbspwider range of people who are stars. A\u0026nbspgeneration are coming through and feeling\u0026nbspfree.”Even artists who had been written off by the industry are finding an afterlife on streaming. After her much-hyped debut, the BBC Sound of 2010 winner, Little Boots, failed to make the Top 40 with her second record and was dropped by her label. Now she releases her own music to a\u0026nbspsmall but committed\u0026nbspfanbase.“Before, I\u0026nbspmight have sold a\u0026nbspton of records, but none of that money went to me after I\u0026nbspgot my advance and I\u0026nbsphad very little say in how the money was spent,” she says on the phone from Los Angeles, where she now lives. “Now, when I\u0026nbsprelease something, I\u0026nbsphave to pay a\u0026nbsppercentage to my distributor, but most of it ends up with me. It’s not a\u0026nbsphuge amount, and I\u0026nbspthink it should be higher, but I\u0026nbsphave control and I\u0026nbsphave transparency. If I\u0026nbspknow I’m going to get 5,000 streams of a\u0026nbsptrack I\u0026nbspcan do the maths and say: that’s this amount of money, so I\u0026nbspcan spend this amount of money on a\u0026nbspnew EP and project how much I’ll make back. I’m like a\u0026nbspboutique business.”Indeed, streaming has allowed artists such as Chance the Rapper, Skepta, Stormzy and Novelist to release music without signing to a\u0026nbsptraditional label, with hundreds of smaller artists successfully following a\u0026nbspsimilar path. Are labels not worried that streaming, while providing a\u0026nbspshort-term bump, will make them\u0026nbspobsolete?“It’s definitely a\u0026nbspchallenge for labels to persuade artists that signing a\u0026nbsprecord deal will be useful to their careers, but I\u0026nbspthink that’s a\u0026nbspgood thing,” says Boateng. “It makes us clear about what we’re trying to achieve. Because artists can see that they’ll earn a\u0026nbspcertain amount of money without any involvement from a\u0026nbsplabel, I\u0026nbspmake an understanding with an artist about what I’m offering. Helping them make the best music they can make, challenging them, introducing new creative relationships\u0026nbsp– that’s where the value lies. Sometimes you’ll get an artist who isn’t interested and they might walk away, but then others, who ambition-wise are thinking a\u0026nbspbit more globally, they can see what we bring to the\u0026nbsptable.”I wonder if this all sounds too good to be true\u0026nbsp– can streaming really be making things better for small artists, big artists and labels? Boateng says there aren’t really any losers, but some music managers and label staff I\u0026nbspspeak to say that if you don’t fit neatly into Spotify playlists, it can be a\u0026nbsplot harder to make an impact. This is particularly true if you’re an unusual indie band whose record someone might once have bought as a\u0026nbspstatus symbol, but not listened to that often. Spotify’s hip-hop playlist Rap Caviar, described by Vulture as “the most influential playlist in music”, has 9.3 million subscribers. The service’s Punked playlist, described as “vital, angry new music from the bleeding edge of modern punk”, has fewer than 5,000.There are lots of small ways Spotify has changed the way music is made. The intros of songs have become shorter to stop listeners skipping a\u0026nbsptrack with a\u0026nbspslow buildup. Albums have got longer, often clocking in at more than 20 tracks, simply because listening to a 20-track album generates twice as much revenue as listening to a 10-track one. Acts with global appeal obviously perform much better than those who are only popular in one country, which means region-specific sounds can lose out. The creation of so many activity-based playlists (music for running, music for relaxing) has also proven challenging for artists who make abrasive music. “It’s undoubtedly easier to programme ‘mood-based’ tunes than music that’s unignorable, interruptive and commands your full attention rather than passively soundtracking another activity,” says\u0026nbspDellow.In practice, this has meant that electronic and urban artists are performing better than they would without streaming whereas local alternative acts are struggling. A\u0026nbspband such as Pale Waves, fifth on the BBC Sound of 2018 tastemakers poll with lots of radio play and written about extensively in the music press, have 428,000 monthly listeners. 6ix9ine, a Brooklyn “SoundCloud rapper” who is barely played on UK radio, has 6.1\u0026nbspmillion.For Dellow, whose label signs mostly alternative acts, this just means they can’t give up on other revenue streams, including physical sales. “In a\u0026nbspsense, we have two markets: those who were previously just listening to music on the radio and not going to shows or buying albums – and that’s great, and they’re easier to reach now – but also a\u0026nbspmarket of diehard obsessives who I’d love to see still supporting an artist with a\u0026nbsppurchase if they’ve been repeatedly streaming and enjoying a\u0026nbsprelease.”Few insiders would air their worries about Spotify on the record, citing the sensitivity of the relationship. The shadowy decision-making process by Spotify playlist compilers is a\u0026nbspconcern, with so much power concentrated in the hands of a\u0026nbspfew, often unidentified, people. Spotify, which has 3,000 employees, refused repeated requests for an interview. (“No one from the team is available,” its publicist\u0026nbspsaid.)Varma strikes another note of caution: although previously artists weren’t making much money from record sales, they were able to develop a\u0026nbspfinancial connection with their fans through touring or merchandise. Now that’s being lost. “Streaming often has no bearing on whether people want to buy tickets or a\u0026nbspphysical album,” says Varma. “The audience is pretty passive for most huge streaming acts. For Jones, we found out that many people streaming her didn’t even know who she was they were streaming her on a\u0026nbspplaylist alongside 50 other\u0026nbspsongs.”Still, even the insiders I\u0026nbspspeak to who do express reservations say that the overall benefits of streaming outweigh the negatives. There is a\u0026nbspsense that streaming has created a\u0026nbspmore democratic music industry one in which artists can make money with or without a\u0026nbsplabel, and where the spending power of a\u0026nbspgenre’s audience doesn’t affect how much money can be\u0026nbspmade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91237590f13eb6f354fdbac71a2576ec01839599/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de57831e9d8b7ec428d6bbcf3f21eed","title":"beyond belief brexit app for eu nationals wont work on iphones","story":"MEPs say problems with app is further proof of Home Office’s poor grasp of technology A mobile phone app for EU nationals seeking to stay in the UK after Brexit – claimed to be as user-friendly as “an online account at LK Bennett” – will not work on iPhones, Home Office officials have admitted.After arriving late for a meeting in Brussels to reassure MEPs of the efficiency of the British government, officials from Amber Rudd’s department conceded that a key function on the app would not work on the phone brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP who attended the meeting, said one Home Office official had suggested applicants could “borrow someone else’s” phone to complete the registration. “It is beyond belief,” Bearder told reporters.The group of officials, who were late due to a delayed Eurostar, were in Brussels to demonstrate to MEPs the functions of the new Home Office app in order to build confidence. Rudd had insisted that using the Home Office app would be as easy for the 3 million EU nationals in the UK as setting up an online account at LK Bennett, the clothes retailer. She also said it had been “extensively tested”, but Home Office officials admitted they had not yet begun mass testing of the app. They also said they would be hiring 1,000 caseworkers for a customer service centre for EU citizens, although they had not yet begun this process. However, the fact that the app does not work on Apple devices has highlighted what many say is the government’s poor record with technology.EU citizens who have tested the app say it requires just a small amount of information, such as a scan of a passport, address, email address and a selfie to match the passport picture. The system then matches the biographical details with HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs records to give the applicant an instant answer as to whether their application has been successful. However, it has emerged that because Apple will not enable its technology to read the chip on modern passports, the registration can only be completed on an Android phone. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, said he would be writing to Theresa May this week about a series of wider concerns, including the £72 cost of registering, and the need for every member of a family to inidually apply for settled status.Verhofstadt said: “The treatment of the Windrush generation under UK immigration law has unfortunately created renewed anxiety among EU citizens in the UK and shows why we have to get this right. The European parliament will closely scrutinise developments and work to ensure sufficient guarantees are in place to avoid the repetition of such a situation for EU citizens.”The London MEP Claude Moraes, chair of the European parliament’s civil liberties committee, said: “In my opinion, there is a need for more investment. They need to understand the political immensity of this, they need to understand that there is no history globally of registration systems based on this technology working.”One person in the meeting is said to have quipped: “It’s like the Irish border – they are trying to solve the problem with technology and we know it won’t work.”Moraes added that he was deeply concerned that the government was registering EU citizens on the basis of secondary rather than primary legislation, allowing the laws to be changed in the future.Under the withdrawal agreement, EU nationals will have recourse to the European court of justice should they have complaints about their treatment, but the scandal over the Windrush generation has illustrated the dangers in the longer term, Verhofstadt said.It is understood that the iPhone compatibility issue was known about at the app’s inception. “We’re speaking to Apple to try and get this resolved,” a Home Office spokesman said.In its statement, the department added that “technology will play an important role” in the identification element of registration, but it was also making “non-digital” routes available to all applicants, including sending a passport through the post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3825c7a60c3a20d0082ce87c42bd6fca455b9f8c/948_729_1652_992/master/1652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f369d9f6e6ef1316b376bbfbfb3931a","title":"sleeping rough comfortable army exercises tory mp adam holloway","story":"Former soldier Adam Holloway also says street homelessness is being driven by eastern European immigration A Conservative MP and former army officer has said that sleeping rough is “a lot more comfortable” than military exercises, in a debate he led on tackling street homelessness.Adam Holloway, the MP for Gravesham in Kent, told parliamentary colleagues in the Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday that if a person is “able-bodied and sound of mind” there are resources that make it possible to sleep rough.He said begging was also part of the problem, allowing homeless people to make “quite a lot of money”. Holloway, a supporter of the pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, also said that a rise in street homelessness was driven by eastern European immigration, claiming that many migrants from that region preferred to sleep rough than pay for accommodation.He said mental illness and drug addiction were “real ingrained problems” behind homelessness that needed to be tackled to solve the crisis.Holloway, who told MPs he had spent a number of nights during the parliamentary recess in February sleeping on the streets as part of a television programme on street homelessness, said: “One observation I do have, if you are able-bodied and of sound mind there are all sorts of services – not quite 24 hours a day – that make it possible to sleep out. “I’m 52, I was in the army to be honest for me sleeping rough in central London is a lot more comfortable than going on exercise in the army.“But if you’re mentally ill or you are old or you are personality disordered then it is a very different thing. Or if you’re drug addicted it is very difficult. We have to accept that some people are able to sleep rough because there are resources to do so.”Holloway’s comments come after research revealed at least 78 homeless people died on the streets and in temporary accommodation this winter, bringing the number of recorded homeless deaths to more than 300 since 2013.Challenged by the Labour MP Laura Smith, Holloway acknowledged that he was not saying “even a large minority of the homeless are there because there are resources for them” but added “we’re going to get absolutely nowhere on this, in solving the problem in getting to the people who are most needy if we just continue to just talk about the homeless and feel sorry for everybody”.He later said there was a link between the scaling back of mental health services and the rise of homelessness. He said in February he took some cardboard to Covent Garden and “bedded down” for the night under the awning of St Paul’s church. The MP said he had first attempted this nearly 27 years ago as a television reporter for ITN’s World In Action. He said that compared with the early 90s, the majority of rough sleepers were “foreign nationals”.Holloway, who faced criticism in 2015 for claiming asylum seekers often holidayed in the country from which they had supposedly fled, said: “As I wandered round as shawls and brand new trainers who were handed out I honestly didn’t hear English being spoken by anybody. I heard east European languages. I heard Arabic. And I heard Italian.”He later said: “If we’re to be honest about the correlation between immigration and rising numbers of street homeless, it’s no surprise to me that 1,950 rough sleepers in 2016-2017 were migrants from Romania, Poland and Lithuania. When people are far from home and familial support structures, homelessness is a much greater risk.“Some migrants do indeed sleep on the streets by choice, preferring to sleep rough than to pay for accommodation.”On the same topic, he said: “On the subject of people from eastern Europe, perhaps it’s time to ask ourselves whether it’s exploitative to build an economy on cheap labour provided by those who can barely afford to accommodate themselves in our country. “Of course you could argue these people are not strictly homeless because they might have a home back home but that’s their reality when they’re here.”Holloway’s claim that the majority of homeless were foreign nationals was challenged by the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn, who said UK-wide this was not the case.Holloway said during his experience on the streets in February he was taken to a hostel in Hither Green, which he said was less comfortable than sleeping rough. “When I left there I was quite relieved, the thought of potentially sleeping days and weeks on the floor in a cramped room between a refrigerator and french windows did not appeal to me,” he said. “I can completely see how if you’re able-bodied and of sound mind it would be much more appealing to sleep under the awning of St Paul’s in Covent Garden because there you have freedom.”Holloway said “people’s generosity can sometimes be as much part of the problem as part of the solution”.“Begging is part of the problem,” he said. “You can make – if you’re able-bodied – quite a lot of money from begging on the streets of London. So generosity of members of the public is a factor in this. Generosity can be enabling.”Holloway did not immediately respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049608569b2e71db85e48ad0b6ce859044121630/89_10_2818_1691/master/2818.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ad6b0f7f9a4dfd9cd89be59bf89e32","title":"brexit blamed record number eu nurses give up britain","story":"UK said farewell to 4,000 nurses and midwives from European Economic Area in past year, with only 800 arrivingRecord numbers of nurses and midwives from EU27 countries quit Britain last year, fuelling fears that a Brexit brain drain will deepen the NHS’s already chronic staffing crisis.A total of 3,962 such staff from the European Economic Area (EEA) left the Nursing and Midwifery Council register between 2017 and 2018. The register tracks who is eligible to work in those areas of healthcare in the UK.“It feels that efforts to boost the number of nurses are being dragged down by a botched Brexit,” said Janet Davies, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing.The government’s refusal to detail the rights that the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain will have once the UK leaves the EU in March next year is a key cause of the loss of EU staff, she added. “Nurses returning home, or giving Britain a miss entirely, are doing so because their rights are not clear enough.” Brexit emerged as a key reason why EU-trained staff are stopping working in the UK in interviews the NMC conducted with 3,496 people who left the register between June and November 2017. The NMC figures bear out the much greater difficulty hospital trusts are having recruiting nurses from Europe, particularly from countries where many have come from in recent years – notably Italy, Portugal and Spain.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “These figures are yet more worrying evidence of the huge impact that the government’s shambolic approach to Brexit is having for our NHS. The government should have made clear straight after the referendum that these staff were valued and welcome but instead ministers dithered and delayed and now we see a huge fall in the number of staff coming to work here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b370ff77c281273dcdc90793a57dadf5cf44702/0_331_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be33c368826ec397a1ce56fad741aea","title":"party leaders urge theresa may to act on childhood obesity","story":"Jeremy Corbyn among those seeking curbs on TV advertising for junk food and discount deals A ban on buy-one-get-one-free offers on junk food, as well as strict new rules on how and when it can be advertised, are among a host of measures aimed at tackling childhood obesity proposed by the leaders of the main opposition parties in a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday.The letter, coordinated by the celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver, also calls for action that would make healthier foods cheaper and easier to recognise, adding that the NHS is struggling to cope with the burgeoning obesity crisis.“We don’t agree on everything, but we do agree on this: If we don’t act now, the current generation of young children could well live shorter lives than their parents,” the letter to Theresa May says.It was signed by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as well as the heads of the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats, Nicola Sturgeon and Vince Cable, and the joint leaders of the Green party, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley.“We are writing to urge you to take bold action to tackle one of the greatest health challenges of our time. A crisis which is putting immense pressure on the NHS as it approaches its 70th birthday,” they write.Saying a raft of measures needed to be introduced en masse to tackle the problem, they say they would support the prime minister if she banned multi-buy offers on junk food, stopped adverts for it before 9pm and online, and prohibited the use of popular cartoon characters and celebrities in ads.Among other proposals, they call for the tax system to be “used to make healthy food cheaper and discourage unhealthy choices both at home and on our high streets”.The leaders also say the levels of sugar, calories, salt and fat in junk food should be lowered overall, while more training should be given to medical staff to help people with nutrition.A government source told the Times many of the opposition proposals were already in the pipeline as part of its anti-obesity drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca39320a1054dc56e13dcd99fb316479280837f/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9c61dbdd37ce0c5b3906a730479fe6","title":"europe gdpr data law employer employee","story":"General Data Protection Regulation holds that anyone in Europe can ask any company for the data it has on themHave you ever wondered what your boss or co-workers say about you behind your back? If you’re located in Europe, it will soon be extremely easy to find out.Under the General Data Protection Regulation that comes into play on 25 May, any inidual located in Europe can ask any company for the data it collects about them – and that includes their employer.If an employee files a “subject access request” – an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data – their employer will have 30 days to collate a cache of all the information stored about that person. This includes any email that refers to the worker, as well as performance reviews, job interviews, payroll records, absence records, disciplinary records, computer access logs, CCTV footage, and recordings of phone calls to, from or about the person.This right has been available to iniduals under existing European data protection rules, such as the UK’s Data Protection Act, but GDPR makes it much easier to access by removing the cost (UK companies could charge £10 for such a request before), reducing the turnaround time from 40 days to 30 days and introducing extremely harsh penalties for companies not complying. “It can cost the company tens of thousands of pounds because it’s incredibly resource intensive,” said Jack Carvel, general counsel at Qubit, which provides personalisation software to e-commerce sites.In responding to a subject access request, the company must not include another employee’s personal information. This means that each item must be painstakingly redacted.“Imagine going through every email sent to you or about you,” said Carvel.If a company deletes any of the data to prevent disclosure after the subject access request is made, it can be liable for criminal sanctions.Subject access requests are typically made by employees in some kind of employment dispute with their employer – it’s a free and quick way of getting “predisclosure” ahead of litigation. However, there’s no reason why an employee, former employee or even someone who only had a job interview with the company can’t make such a request just out of interest.Because of how onerous such requests can be, some data privacy experts warn that they could be exploited by activists to punish a company. A group of unhappy former employees could all file requests at the same time, forcing the company to dedicate resources to respond within the 30-day timeframe.“If you look at it from that angle it seems unfair for companies. But think about the pensioner who was refused a mortgage and doesn’t understand why,” said Carvel, referring to a case for which the regulation was designed. “It’s not intended to be for malicious activists or disgruntled employees.”Subject access requests generally allow an inidual to see a copy of the information an organisation holds about them, whether it’s a mortgage lender, social media company or retailer.There are some exceptions to the data that companies must hand over, including information relating to trade secrets, anything relating to current management issues such as restructuring or redundancies, any confidential communications with lawyers, health records, or personal data that is processed for purposes relating to criminal justice and taxation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f773481bed2f0d524916a70b8e31f11555b119b9/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7afbd1b1642c4d3dfd1683e6e6717931","title":"amazon jeff bezos customer data industries","story":"With its profound knowledge of its customers, Amazon can move into almost any sector – striking fear into the hearts of rivals. And the $740bn company is ‘just getting started’by  Olivia Solon and  Julia Carrie Wong in San FranciscoThe computer on which this article was written is sitting on a laptop stand that tells you everything you need to know about how Amazon does business. At $19.99 (£14.99) a pop, the laptop stand combines everything customers love about Amazon: utility, price and convenience. It’s also a total and complete knockoff – of a laptop stand that the San Francisco-based company Rain Design began selling nearly a decade before Amazon decided to make its own.Amazon’s innovation with its own version was to replace Rain Design’s raindrop logo with its own smiley arrow logo – and cut the price in half.“All Amazon had to do was pick the best one and copy it,” said Rachel Greer, a former product manager for Amazon who runs a consulting firm for Amazon vendors. Rain Design isn’t the first company to fall victim to the aggressive techniques Amazon uses to achieve market dominance. Although its retail site is the most visible of its business strands, the $740bn company has quietly stretched its tentacles into an astonishing range of unrelated industries. Google and Facebook might have cornered the online advertising market, but Amazon’s business successes now include groceries, TV, robotics, cloud services and consumer electronics. “If you try to measure power by how many executives are up at night because of X company, I think Amazon would win,” said Lina Khan, legal fellow with the Open Markets Program at the thinktank New America. Amazon has a restaurant delivery service, a music streaming service and an Etsy clone called Amazon Homemade. It makes hugely successful hardware and software it makes movies, television shows and video games. It runs a labour brokerage for computer-based work and another for manual labour. It publishes books, sells books, and owns the popular social network site for book readers GoodReads. It sells diapers, baby food, snacks, clothing, furniture and batteries. It sells ads, processes payments, and makes small loans. It is the unexpected owner of a huge number of websites – everything from the gaming livestream site Twitch to the movie database IMDb.Of the top 10 US industries by GDP (information, manufacturing non-durable goods, retail trade, wholesale trade, manufacturing durable goods, healthcare, finance and insurance, state and local government, professional and business services, and real estate), Amazon has a finger in all but real estate. And how confident can the real estate industry be right now that Amazon won’t at some point decide to allow people to buy and sell homes on its platform? “I see them as kind of a great white shark,” said Greer. “You don’t really want to mess with them.”“It’s basically become a railroad for the 21st century,” added Khan. “It’s existential for so many businesses but also competing with all those businesses.”  What makes Amazon so frightening for rival businesses is that it can use its expertise in data analytics to move into almost any sector. “Amazon has all this data available. They track what people are searching for, what they click, what they don’t,” said Greer. “Every time you’re searching for something and don’t click, you’re telling Amazon that there’s a gap.”Amazon knows where you live, who you live with, your current location (if you use an Amazon smartphone app), what TV shows you watch, what music you listen to and what websites you visit. “It’s obsessed with understanding its customers,” said the Tuck School of Business professor Vijay Govindarajan. “The more you understand every aspect of a customer, the more it can satisfy your needs.”This obsession with knowing its customers means that, while feared by almost every business, Amazon is beloved by customers. It’s viewed as cheap, convenient and reliable. “Amazon’s north star is to delight the customer,” said Gene Munster, a former Amazon analyst who runs an investment firm, Loup Ventures. Despite its treasure trove of personal data – the kind that allows retailers to predict if their teenage customers are pregnant before their parents know – Amazon has mostly avoided using that data in ways that unnerve people. But the consumer trust it has built up does not reflect the damage the company does to competitors, partners and workers, according to Khan. “Only looking at a consumer side of a business power is totally ludicrous. It slices the human in half, not looking at them as a worker, producer or supplier.”Customers might be getting super-fast deliveries of cheap laundry detergent and binge-worthy TV shows, but the same company has also been accused of displacing jobs in the locations where it builds its fulfilment centres, treating warehouse workers like robots, aggressively undercutting rivals and squeezing suppliers and producers. “The algorithms are designed to serve up things that best serve Amazon, steering us to some books and not others,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “You have a company that can shape whether a particular author is able to find an audience, and whether they can even get published.”That power means that “people don’t know if there’s something they’re missing”. The company doesn’t even shy away from competing with its own investments. After pumping $5.6m into the startup Nucleus and its Alexa-powered video-conferencing tablet, Amazon turned around and released its own suspiciously similar device, the Echo Show. “They probably copied us,” the Nucleus co-founder Jonathan Frankel said last year. “When they had the opportunity to extend their tentacles into millions of homes, they had to do it, even if it means throwing us under the bus, even if it means putting their whole ecosystem at risk and letting people know that they’re not necessarily a trusted partner.”Amazon declined to comment on its investment into Nucleus or on the design of its laptop stand, but noted that Rain’s design remained the bestselling stand on the site.Since 2012, Bespoke Investment Group has been tracking an index of 54 retail stocks, known as the “Death by Amazon index”, that it considers most vulnerable to Amazon. “It’s a somewhat melodramatic title, we admit,” said George Pearkes, a macro strategist with Bespoke. “But it encapsulates what is going on in retail quite well.” And it wouldn’t be surprising if Amazon were to sell the technology that powers the futuristic stores to other retailers so that they too could automate their stores and cut jobs. Doing that would allow the company to keep track of the sales made by its competitors – just as it does on Amazon – and use that data to inform its decisions about other retail categories to move into. “Amazon is just getting started,” said Govindarajan. Another huge growth area is healthcare and the pharmacy business, according to Khan, who sees the health insurance joint-venture Amazon launched with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan as a way to “get experience in the sector and then double down”. The company, which is already taking payments and making loans to third-party sellers, has also laid the foundations to push further into financial services. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they tried to look at the option of obtaining an industrial bank charter,” said Mitchell. What’s the CEO Jeff Bezos’s endgame? Khan suggests it could be a “tax on all economic activity”. “If you view it that way it’s difficult to think about what sector he wouldn’t touch,” she said. Khan believes that Amazon needs to face antitrust regulation, but current law is not equipped to deal with it. “I think a rule that prohibited it from competing with the businesses that use its platforms would eliminate a lot of the core conflicts I mentioned,” she said. Eliminating this conflict of interest would mean Amazon could provide the Amazon marketplace, but not its products, for example. Without regulation, Amazon will “continue to extract wealth that other businesses are creating”, Khan added.

The disclosure comes amid a publicity blitz by the company to regain users’ trust following the Observer’s revelation in March that the personal Facebook data of tens of millions of users was improperly obtained by a political consultancy.In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said that the publication of the guidelines was a step toward his personal goal “to develop a more democratic and independent system for determining Facebook’s Community Standards”. The 27-page document provides insight into the rationale Facebook uses to develop its standards, which must balance users’ safety and the right to free expression while maintaining a sufficiently sanitized platform for advertisers.The company has long banned content from terrorist organizations and hate groups, for example, but the document reveals how Facebook actually defines such groups.“You have told us that you don’t understand our policies it’s our responsibility to provide clarity,” said Monika Bickert, Facebook’s vice-president of global policy management, in a blogpost. Other details include bans on posts in which an inidual admits to using non-medical drugs “unless posted in a recovery context”, posts that compare a private inidual to “animals that are culturally perceived as intellectually or physically inferior or to an inanimate object”, and images that include the “presence of by-products of sexual activity” unless the content is intended to be satirical or humorous. One guideline bans images that include a “visible anus andor fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public figure”. Spam messages are not allowed to “promise non-existent Facebook features”. The company also bans so-called “false flag” assertions (eg claiming that the victims of a violent tragedy are lying or are paid actors), defining such statements as harassment. Facebook’s role as a global publisher – and censor – has long created controversy for the platform, and free speech advocates have for years advocated for more transparency from Facebook around its decision-making process for content takedowns. But the document leaves out the kind of specific examples of policy enforcement that the  published in the Facebook Files. Those documents – which were used for training content moderators – revealed how complicated it is to apply seemingly straightforward standards. According to training slides on hate speech, for example, the statements “You are such a Jew” or “Migrants are so filthy” are allowed, but writing “Irish are the best, but really French sucks” is not.The release of Facebook’s rules draws attention to the difficult work of the 7,500 content moderators – many of them subcontractors – who are tasked with applying the rules to the billions of pieces of content uploaded to the platform. The low-paid job involves being exposed to the most graphic and extreme content on the internet, making quick judgments about whether a certain symbol is linked to a terrorist group or whether a nude drawing is satirical, educational, or merely salacious. “Now that we know about the policies, what can we know about the people who can enforce them?” said Roberts. “How can we be assured they have the support and information they need to make decisions on behalf of the platform and all of us?”While speech advocates have long called on Facebook to provide some form of appeals process for content removal, many said Tuesday that the company’s current plan was inadequate. The new plan, which the company said would be built upon over the next year, will allow users whose posts were removed for nudity, sexual activity, hate speech or violence to request having their posts re-reviewed by a human moderator. “Users need a meaningful, robust right to appeal the removal of any post – and before it is removed,” Nicole Ozer, the director of technology and civil liberties for the ACLU, said in a statement. She called on Facebook to provide a process whereby users can explain why their content should not be censored she also urged Facebook to release statistics about its content removals. Ozer also raised concerns about Facebook’s reliance on artificial intelligence to enforce content rules. “AI will not solve these problems,” she said. “It will likely exacerbate them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d492c16f8acdabc4ea23a001ae1471037ebe72c/3_0_4547_2731/master/4547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20afb3688c937d9789595c808372501e","title":"huawei p20 pro review three camera iphone top end smartphone","story":"The Chinese smartphone maker has hit a home run with this top-end smartphone that’s on a par with the best With the P20 Pro, Huawei has not only proved that it can compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung, but it can beat them in many ways. Three cameras really are better than one (or two).Having established its name in value smartphones, Huawei has recently made inroads into the premium market with the likes of the Mate 10 Pro and last year’s P10. They were of high quality, and had all the features you’d expect from an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S. But until now they’ve not quite captured the same luxurious feel. The P20 Pro has a 6.1in full HD+ OLED screen, bigger than even the Mate 10 Pro, but squeezed into a compact body with tiny bezels rivalling Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. It also has a notch in the top – a cutout in the screen that contains a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, the earpiece speaker and various sensors. The screen is bright and colourful, although not quite as pixel dense as rivals, and text is not quite as pin-sharp when viewed side-by-side. It’s a beautiful display that is close, but not quite as good as the best from Samsung or Apple.Unlike rivals, Huawei has kept its best-in-class fingerprint scanner on the front, squeezed into an oval shape at the bottom of the screen. The back is glass with curved edges that blend neatly into the rounded and polished metal band around the sides. The camera modules stick out the back similar to an iPhone X, which means it doesn’t sit flush on a desk.At 7.8mm thick and 180g in weight, the P20 Pro feels thin with an luxurious quality to it. It’s 0.7mm thinner and 9g lighter than Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, but 0.1mm thicker and 6g heavier than Apple’s iPhone X. All of which is to say the Huawei matches up well.The P20 Pro is also water resistant to IP67 standards, meaning up to 1m of water for up to 30 minutes – good enough to survive a trip down the toilet or into the bath.The P20 Pro has the same processor and memory configuration as the Mate 10 Pro – Huawei’s own Kirin 970 octo-core processor and its neural network processing unit – and as such is as fast and powerful as the earlier handset, keeping pace with its rivals.The P20 Pro lasts significantly longer than both Apple and Samsung’s best between charges, although not quite as long as the 50-hours the Mate 10 Pro lasts. The P20 Pro consistently lasted over 39 hours on a single charge without having to activate any power saving modes. That was with two sims in it, using the smartphone as a primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours a day with hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Netflix, the odd spot of navigation in Google maps, shooting around 30 photos and listening to around four hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.There’s no wireless charging, but the P20 Pro charges pretty fast using the supplied power adapter and USB-C cable, despite having a comparatively large battery.The P20 Pro runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.1, based on Android Oreo 8.1, making it right up to date on launch.It behaves very similarly to EMUI 8 running on the Mate 10 Pro – there is a Google Feed on the home screen and it offers the option to have an app drawer or force every app to have an icon on the home screen a la Apple’s iOS.Various power-saving features are built in, including a system to keep rogue apps from destroying your battery life. Huawei’s ultra power-saving mode can significantly extend the battery life by disabling functions and limiting the number of apps you can use, if you really need your smartphone to last four days.EMUI handles the notch in the screen very well, acting more like a screen with two ears at the top than one with a disruptive cutout. Notifications and other icons easily fit either side of the notch in the status bar, which by default is either transparent or colour-matched to the content on screen. There’s also an option to make it black all the time, effectively hiding the notch entirely.The big difference between the approach Huawei has used v that of Apple for the iPhone X is that when content or apps are displayed on the screen the area either side of the notch is blocked off so that it doesn’t intrude into what’s on-screen.Some will simply hate the idea of the notch, but being narrow and using the space either side of it as the status bar is actually a good compromise.The P20 Pro is the first smartphone to have not one, not two, but three cameras on the back, all working in conjunction to provide a multi-layered camera experience.The primary camera is a large, 40-megapixel colour camera with an f1.8 lens, which is joined by a 20-megapixel monochrome camera with an f1.6 lens and an eight megapixel telephoto camera with an f2.4 lens.The system automatically uses a combination of the cameras on the back to produce each shot. The monochrome camera adds extra light, detail and depth information, while the telephoto camera increases the zoom magnification.The combination produces excellent detail, low noise and accurate colour capture. In good light it shoots images that are stunning. In low light the P20 Pro excels too, routinely producing better images than rivals.But it is the hybrid zoom that really makes the P20 Pro really stand out. Many dual-camera smartphones offer up to a 2x zoom, which often proves rather modest. The Huawei offers up to 5x hybrid zoom, with steps all the way up and a button to switch between 1x, 3x and 5x zoom. Images shot at 3x and 5x zoom are very good, even in low light. There are plenty of modes to play with, including portrait and aperture modes, a monochrome mode that uses the dedicated camera, and an excellent long exposure night mode, which works very well even when handheld.The P20 Pro also captures very good video, including up to 960fps slow motion, and has a “Pro” mode with plenty of settings to keep most photographers happy, including RAW capture.By default the camera shoots 10-megapixel images, but there’s an option to shoot at the full 40-megapixel size, which can be fun.Huawei’s built-in camera AI performs real-time object recognition to detect the subject and switch to the appropriate mode or scene. In most circumstances it does an admirable job, but occasionally it would get caught between scenes, such as “greenery” and “flower” when trying to shoot a bunch of roses. I also found some of the modes to artificially skew the colours in the image a bit too much for my liking, making them look like photos tweaked for Instagram. I turned it off for some shoots and got better results.The front-facing selfie camera is also very good, producing well detailed and lit shots, complete with your choice of beautification effects, such as the face-shaping “perfect selfie” mode.The Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage and is available in three colours.For comparison, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.3in Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with 64GB of storage costs £869, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in OnePlus 5T with 64GB costs £449, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.With the P20 Pro Huawei has finally produced something that I would recommend over competitors regardless of the price. While not cheap, costing £800, in some ways you get a better experience than rivals costing £200 more.But the P20 Pro isn’t a value proposition it is a no-holds-barred attempt to usurp the current kings of the top-end smartphone, Samsung and Apple. The Mate 10 Pro was great, but Huawei has hit a home run with the P20 Pro.It’s a fantastic-looking phone that feels better than rivals in the hand, lasts significantly longer between charges and has a one of the best cameras available, offering useful features that others can’t match.There’s no wireless charging, no headphone socket, EMUI has its quirks and Huawei’s record of keeping up with software and security updates is a bit patchy. But it’s truly great to see a company that isn’t Apple or Samsung pushing boundaries once more.Cons: no headphone socket, no microSD card slot, no wireless charging, screen not the highest resolution, no Bluetooth 5 support"},{"url":null,"title":"bezoss empire how amazon became the worlds biggest retailer","story":"Amazon has shipped more than 400 items per second at its peak.

That was my greatest takeaway from the new drama by Abi Morgan, who won Baftas for Sex Traffic and The Iron Lady, and an Emmy for The Hour, and is not quite as flippant as it sounds.The meat of the thing lay in the story of two generations of lawyers working the high-end orce circuit in their respective firms. In the first of six episodes, Hannah (Nicola Walker, leading a uniformly fine set of performances) has just left Defoes, which her parents founded. Her mother, Ruth (Deborah Findlay), refused to step down as promised and let Hannah, the ever-responsible oldest of her three daughters, take over, so Hannah departed and started at another, equally shiny top-flight family law firm. More chaotic middle child Nina (Annabel Scholey) – vestiges of the party-girl-she-was trailing behind her like the drifts of papers that fall in her wake as she rushes, late, to meetings – is still at Defoes.The world of big orce cases being small, by the time the episode is out, the two sisters are on opposing sides of a custody case involving a comedian, Rex Pope (played by Mathew Baynton, whose nervy soulfulness works perfectly), and his soon-to-be-ex-wife-and-agent. Defoes has semi-poached a big businessman fish from Hannah, and the fish’s wife, Goldie, hires Hannah in her turn. There’s much more, but it’s all superbly paced and never overwhelming.Sub-plots include: Nina having sex with Rex youngest Defoe daughter, Rose, getting married and already having to push away doubts dad Oscar returning unannounced after a 30-year absence for reasons yet unknown and one of Hannah’s new colleagues being an old friend with whom she once had A Thing and who is totally up for Another Thing (or rather, another bit of very much the same Thing) despite the fact that Hannah is now married to and has three children with Nathan (Stephen Mangan, no relation, in case you were wondering).Oh yes, the meat of the thing is a generous joint, rich, juicy and marbled with possibility. The interplay of family and office politics, the shifting perspectives on marriage from people at different stages of loving and being left, the ramifications of abandonment and failure, the fragility of family, all of it refracted – still so rare! Still such potential! – through a primarily female lens is a meal by itself. But as my grandmother used to say with a sigh of satisfaction after Sunday lunch: The meat was good, but oh! The gravy!The gravy here is all the scenes in between the “important” ones, in which the family, or friends, or colleagues just … talk. Rib each other. Mutter dark, pointed jokes. Tease. Undermine each other, or bolster their connections by being witty, clever, daft and sarky. Just like real family, friends and colleagues. Just like real people. Morgan’s characters tell us most in the interstices, when the world falls away. The three drunk sisters trying on their mother’s clothes while the surprise 70th birthday party she didn’t want unfolds downstairs. An overloaded goodbye from a female friend that tells Goldie all she needs to know about why her husband is leaving. Hannah and Nathan ing back into a party because they’ve forgotten their kids (“Children!”) the agent-wife telling Rex he can’t use the stuff about her mum’s cancer in the act, but her leaking milk everywhere while breastfeeding is fine Nathan plunging through the revellers when the younger set take over the playlist. “This music must die! You’ll kill all the old people!” Just throwaway lines, but they mean everything. They are the lubrication that allows the characters to pivot and show us their lives and\u0026nbspselves in the round. It’s the hardest and most vital kind of dialogue and Morgan is a master of it. It makes you realise what we’re missing almost all the rest of the time on TV.Within a gorgeously slick production, all the messiness of life is here and looks set to get even messier over the next five weeks, as life tends to do. I already feel myself relaxing in the knowledge that I do not have to steel myself to endure unnatural histrionics, looping twists or swooping personality changes in protagonists I already feel I know, understand and am already deeply invested in. I feel like an adult watching adults, one of the scarcest and best feelings as a viewer I know.

Serzh Sarksyan, who previously served as Armenia’s president for a decade, resigned as prime minister on Monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power. “The Republican party is thinking about taking advantage of Serzh Sarksyan’s resignation and wants to keep power,” opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan said in a video appeal posted on Facebook after he led thousands of people on a march on Tuesday. “We can’t agree on the appointment of this party’s representative as prime minister and we can’t allow this corrupted system to continue to exist,” he said, urging supporters “to come to the square and finish the velvet revolution.” Pashinyan played a key role in ousting Sarksyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released. He had been set to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday, but they were cancelled late on Tuesday. Sarksyan was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow is closely watching events in the former Soviet republic, where it has two military bases. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.Acting Prime Minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of the ousted Sarksyan, called on the president to organise another meeting, where all political forces could participate. “Being concerned by the current situation ... I’m calling on the president to organise the meeting ... with the participation of parliamentary and non-parliamentary political forces,” Karapetyan said in a statement. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, another ally of the ex-premier, was sworn in as president earlier this month after being elected by parliament. Under a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister while the presidency became a largely ceremonial post. The opposition and ruling party could not agree on an agenda or format for Wednesday’s planned meeting, although Karapetyan said one of the topics at a rescheduled session could be holding early parliamentary elections, something Pashinyan was insisting on. In another move likely to prolong the political crisis that has rocked one of Russia’s closest allies from the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said he was ready to be the country’s next premier and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until it agreed to real change. “If people put this responsibility on me, I’m ready to become the prime minister,” Pashinyan said. In Los Angeles on Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators attended a rally to mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/555ea3f07572f719574350021c41ab846713bcb0/0_165_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a49a5ed6ef62317a91e312162f9875","title":"vanuatu landslide and flash flood hampers relief effort on ambae","story":"Manaro volcano rumbling, spewing torrents of ash, gas and rocks from its craterA landslide and flash flood on the Vanuatu island of Ambae is complicating evacuation efforts, with as many as 800 people now sheltering in emergency relief centres.Ambae Island is home to 11,000 people, and for the second time in six months Manaro volcano on top of Mount Lombenben has started rumbling, spewing torrents of ash, gas and rocks from its crater. The debris is causing breathing and health problems, and threatening livelihoods by burying vegetable plots and crops.The government has declared a three-month state of emergency while it works with non-governmental organisations to safely evacuate the island and secure new homes for displaced islanders who may never be able to return. Acting prime minister Jean Pierre Nirua said Vanuatu was the most vulnerable country in the world to natural disasters, and was currently stretched by responding to the clean-up of last month’s cyclone Hola and the unfolding Ambae emergency. According to the Vanuatu meteorology and geohazards department the volcano remains at level three, with a danger zone surrounding the cone of three kilometres. Due to eruption activity the cone of the volcano had widened, resulting in ash fall, gas, and acid rain, as well as a heightened risk of landslides and flash floods.Olivia Finau from the Vanuatu Red Cross said there was a likelihood it would remain active for some time, forcing the government to plan for the permanent relocation of Ambae Islanders to nearby Islands. Some neighbouring chiefs had already made offers of land suitable for relocation to the government.A reconciliation ceremony was staged last week between the Island chiefs of Santos and Ambae, after Santos Islanders took offence at the alleged ungratefulness of evacuees who stayed on their island last year, the Vanuatu Daily Post reports.Access to the island for NGOs and government officials is proving challenging after a local airline cancelled flights, forcing the government to charter a plane on Tuesday. Southern parts of Ambae Island were worst hit by ash fall, and Unicef workers on the ground reported people with asthma or other respiratory problems were having difficulty breathing.“It is really challenging for the affected community, it is their home and all they know, they’ve been there for their entire life,” said Uncief Pacific’s chief of communications Cate Heinrich, adding that there were more than 5,000 children on Ambae.“At the moment our priority is helping women and children who have been affected, making sure children have safe spaces and helping them begin to process and understand what is happening to their home, using techniques like drawing.”Many water sources have been contaminated by ash, with water needing to be trucked in or purified using tablets. Some schools were closed, and there was a sense of limbo as locals waited for the government to establish a time-line for the evacuation, which was being conducted much more slowly and safely than the DIY-style evacuation last year, said Heinrich.On Monday the Chinese ambassador Liu Quan presented a cheque for AU$120K to the Vanuatuan government to aid in the relief effort.The Australian government provided AU$3.2m to support early recovery efforts for those affected by the Ambae volcano last year, and is ready to give further assistance, a spokesperson said. The New Zealand government has provided more than NZ$1.5m in assistance, as well as technical support and relief supplies.Vanuatu is no stranger to natural disasters, and its 83 islands are stuck in the middle of hurricane alley and dot the border of the “ring of fire” – a belt around the Pacific prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d37f0b205ec3682f8d0c6a3f28b9b705bd64b/0_228_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab332e0ac7f7a33691799b00fc3ae29","title":"emmanuel macron goes to washington in pictures","story":"The French president and his wife Brigitte opened their pomp-filled three-day state visit with a double date with Donald and Melania Trump at George Washington’s house"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv shows collision on wellington quay in dublin","story":"  April 24, 2018Garda\u0026iacute pin driver to ground after car hits several vehicles in multiple incidents "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3473212.1524604200!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord tds draw line at images of repeal artwork","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRuth Coppinger and Paul Murphy holding up “Repeal the Eighth” posters in the Dáil on Tuesday.

This was because the artwork, by street artist Maser, addressed a political issue.It features the outline of a heart in red on a blue background with “Repeal the Eighth” written through it.“This country has an inglorious record of censorship, both artistic and political, and this parliament should be clear,” said Ruth Coppinger, “a piece of art was removed from an arts building in 2018 in a ruling more reminiscent of the Committee on Evil Literature of the 1920s.”Quoting George Orwell along the way, Coppinger asked the Taoiseach if he believed that “that art shouldn’t argue for social change and that charities shouldn’t either”.As she saw it, the view that this mural is outside the brief of an arts centre is a subjective one. And while this is the assertion of the chief executive of the Charities Regulator, she felt it was a subjective one because he is “someone who also has a long connection himself with the Catholic Church and a history of writing Catholic texts”.As Coppinger spoke, the tut-tutting began at the opposite end of the chamber, where McGrath and the Healy-Raes sit. They were joined by a handful off Fianna Fáil TDs, all of whom did not agree with the Socialist TD’s argument.She wanted the Taoiseach to review the decision to remove the mural and wondered if he could get to the bottom of how the artwork, in Temple Bar, “came under orchestrated attack, with all of the complaints being lodged on one day”.It began to sound like a row about holy pictures. “Are we back to the old days of de Valera, when the arts had to keep to the holiest traditions?” asked Ruth.“What was wrong with de Valera?” piped up Michael Healy-Rae (who is from a strong Fianna Fáil background.)“Or the Catholic Church?” added his brother, Danny.Coppinger said the Project Arts Centre did not have the funds to challenge the decision.“The campaign to repeal the Eighth might give you a bit of money,” quipped McGrath.The Dublin West TD called it “a remarkable double standard” that the Catholic Church could be “an active agent” in the referendum without having to register with the Standards in Public Office Commission, which secular groups must do. Many religious organisations are on the register of charities and seem to have no problem using their buildings to “propagate the anti-repeal position”.Leo Varadkar couldn’t help her. The decision to remove the mural was made by the Charities Regulator and he presumed it did not matter whether it was a pro-choice or anti-abortion painting on the wall of the arts centre.He wasn’t too put out by what happened. If anything, he reckoned that, because all the publicity, more people than might otherwise have been expected will see the image and read the message.Furthermore, he threw out an interesting prediction. “I’ve no doubt that the mural will appear elsewhere, perhaps somebody who has a private building may wish to make space available for the mural to be reinstated.”“While you can paint over a mural, you certainly can’t paint over an issue, and the issue is that nine women every day in Ireland are forced to travel overseas in order to end their pregnancies, and three women in Ireland every day – and the number is only rise into the future – are importing pills online and are taking them without medical supervision and guidance, often in their own homes.”At the end of her second and final question, Coppinger wondered what was actually offensive in the mural.As she said earlier, the irony of its removal was that there was a “proliferation of No posters which are offensive and upsetting”.Paraphrasing a famous Jack Nicholson line, Mattie scoffed at her. “You don’t like the truth.”The Taoiseach thought Maser’s artwork was fine. “Certainly, from my personal point of view, I don’t find the mural in any way offensive, but I don’t think it’s murals or posters that are going to change people’s minds or convince people on this issue.”(That being said, he won’t be adverse to a few thousand Leo posters hitting the nation’s lampposts at the next election.)In truth, if deputies really wanted to be offended, they could have stepped outside the Dáil chamber and walked to the main entrance. Right along the gates, almost as high as them, was a collection of the most lurid and graphic images of blood-soaked alleged foetal body parts.The groups of schoolchildren who visited Leinster House would have had to walk past these pictures on their way in.Some TDs may have approved of them.Yet not of small photocopies of an innocuous piece of art.Coppinger held up her page, then Paul Murphy, Richard Boyd-Barrett, Gino Kenny and Bríd Smith. They didn’t do it for very long and said nothing.But they had broken the rules. People complained.Outside the gates, there seemed to be a different set of rules.“I believe the Maser mural will actually be more popular as a result and I believe the message young people should take from it s to use it in the referendum to win a repeal vote,” said Coppinger.And she hoped she would be able to speak in the Dáil “and not be shouted down by a group of male deputies who can never actually be pregnant”.No. That would be a hope too far.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

not the time for more legal manoeuvres.And he criticised the \u0026quotmalign hand\u0026quot of one of the family\u0027s advisers, law student Pavel Stroilov, who had, the court heard, been party to Mr Evans lodging a private prosecution of Alder Hey Hospital doctors, allegedly for murder.The judge said, in fact, the hospital had provided \u0026quotworld class\u0026quot care for the child.The hospital\u0027s doctors and independent medical experts say there is no cure and no hope for Alfie.Medics say he has a degenerative neurological condition destroying his brain, and it is in his best interests to withdraw life support.Alder Hey said its top priority \u0026#34remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves\u0026#34In a statement, Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital said: \u0026quotThis evening the High Court again ruled that it is in Alfie\u0027s best interests to continue with the end of life care plan developed by the clinical team who have cared for him throughout.\u0026quotOur top priority therefore remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout. This includes working closely with Kate and Tom as they spend this precious time together with him.\u0026quotWe would be grateful if respect and consideration is shown to all our staff, patients and families at the hospital at this difficult time.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyToronto van attack victims: An \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 charity worker and a sports-loving grandmotherEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39new deal\u0026#39 on Iran as Donald Trump blasts \u0026#39insane\u0026#39 current agreementAdmiral Harry Harris lined up to fill America\u0026#39s key South Korean envoy postTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedWhatsApp raising minimum age to 16 - but unclear how it will enforce age limitBritain to rival EU\u0026#39s Galileo space project by sending own satellite navigation system into spaceNew law could be made against upskirting in the UKAllison Mack attempted to recruit Emma Watson to join New York \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39Trump welcomes Macron with handshakes, hugs and kissesComment: War between Iran and Israel is coming - and Britain must take a stand against the former\u0026#39s terrorist proxiesWoman orcing husband when he died claims £675k damages because \u0026#39I still loved him\u0026#39Cheltenham Festival punter nearly blinded in attack \u0026#39because he wore pink suit\u0026#39Why big data is killing western democracy - and giving authoritarian states a new lease of lifeToronto suspect begged police to shoot him after van ploughs into pedestrians leaving ten deadToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireComment: France is an unreliable lover - which is why it won\u0026#39t replace Britain as America\u0026#39s primary allyNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Children in developing countries who cannot access care are particularly vulnerable, Dr Zaidi added..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they areDr Anita Zaidi“Rotavirus is a disease that can kill within hours. Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Toronto van attack victims: An \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 charity worker and a sports-loving grandmotherEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39new deal\u0026#39 on Iran as Donald Trump blasts \u0026#39insane\u0026#39 current agreementAdmiral Harry Harris lined up to fill America\u0026#39s key South Korean envoy postTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedWhatsApp raising minimum age to 16 - but unclear how it will enforce age limitBritain to rival EU\u0026#39s Galileo space project by sending own satellite navigation system into spaceNew law could be made against upskirting in the UKAllison Mack attempted to recruit Emma Watson to join New York \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39Trump welcomes Macron with handshakes, hugs and kissesComment: War between Iran and Israel is coming - and Britain must take a stand against the former\u0026#39s terrorist proxiesWoman orcing husband when he died claims £675k damages because \u0026#39I still loved him\u0026#39Cheltenham Festival punter nearly blinded in attack \u0026#39because he wore pink suit\u0026#39Why big data is killing western democracy - and giving authoritarian states a new lease of lifeToronto suspect begged police to shoot him after van ploughs into pedestrians leaving ten deadAlfie Evans can return home, judge rules - but he can\u0026#39t go to Italy for treatmentToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireComment: France is an unreliable lover - which is why it won\u0026#39t replace Britain as America\u0026#39s primary allyNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

We really need to make sure that our law reflects that of Scotland\u0027s, where this has been incorporated into their Sexual Offences Act 2009.\u0026quotMr Gauke reiterated that he is sympathetic to the request for further action, adding: \u0026quotThere are offences in place where people have successfully been prosecuted for upskirting, in terms of outraging public decency, and also voyeurism can also apply under the Sexual Offences Act.\u0026quotBut I think there is a case to say these offences don\u0027t necessarily cover every incidence of upskirting and that is why there is a strong case for looking at the law and whether we need to change it.\u0026quotIn response to a later question from Labour\u0027s Diana Johnson (Kingston upon Hull North), Mr Gauke said the impact of legislation in Scotland is being looked at closely.He added that there have been successful prosecutions in England under existing laws, adding: \u0026quotI think there is a case for making sure we\u0027ve got something specific.\u0026quotLib Dem MP Ms Hobhouse\u0027s Voyeurism (Offences) Bill is included as part of Commons business on May 11 although it is near the bottom of the list.It is unlikely to be debated but would receive a second reading and progress to the next stage for further scrutiny if no MPs shout \u0026quotObject\u0026quot when its title is read out.Please review our commenting policyToronto van attack victims: An \u0026#39incredible\u0026#39 charity worker and a sports-loving grandmotherEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39new deal\u0026#39 on Iran as Donald Trump blasts \u0026#39insane\u0026#39 current agreementAdmiral Harry Harris lined up to fill America\u0026#39s key South Korean envoy postTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedWhatsApp raising minimum age to 16 - but unclear how it will enforce age limitBritain to rival EU\u0026#39s Galileo space project by sending own satellite navigation system into spaceAllison Mack attempted to recruit Emma Watson to join New York \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39Trump welcomes Macron with handshakes, hugs and kissesComment: War between Iran and Israel is coming - and Britain must take a stand against the former\u0026#39s terrorist proxiesWoman orcing husband when he died claims £675k damages because \u0026#39I still loved him\u0026#39Cheltenham Festival punter nearly blinded in attack \u0026#39because he wore pink suit\u0026#39Why big data is killing western democracy - and giving authoritarian states a new lease of lifeToronto suspect begged police to shoot him after van ploughs into pedestrians leaving ten deadAlfie Evans can return home, judge rules - but he can\u0026#39t go to Italy for treatmentToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireComment: France is an unreliable lover - which is why it won\u0026#39t replace Britain as America\u0026#39s primary allyNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Once the wearer is about to leave Hypnagogia and transition into deep sleep, a bedside robot is triggered to emit a noise to push them back into the dream state.If the noise used to slightly wake the person is a word, the researchers found that it could enter the Dormio wearer’s dreams. For example, if the robot says “fork” or “rabbit”, the dream will incorporate these objects.Gadgets and tech news in picturesGadgets and tech news in picturesDesigned by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

Both Dali and Edison would access Hypnagogia by falling asleep with a steel ball in their hand, which would crash to the floor while they were in this state of sleep. They would then be able to capture the ideas and thoughts generated through their dreams.This technique is described by the researchers as “inspiring but limited,” as it does not offer the additional capabilities of the new system that allow people to explore this state of sleep more thoroughly, either by prolonging it or controlling it.“Good neuroscience, to me, is effective self-examination. Good technology in service of making neuroscience relevant outside the laboratory, then, should facilitate self-examination,” said research assistant Adam Horowitz, who led the research. “The ends of this project are both practical and philosophical. I have no doubt that Hypnagogia holds applications for augmenting memory, learning, and creativity. Yet also, after exploring the state myself, I find it to be a deeply valuable and inspiring sort of self-seeing which was inaccessible to me previously.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

its library.A Sheffield Hallam student, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that a security guard referred to him as “a monkey” when he accidentally left his student card in the library.“I was in complete shock and upset at the way he casually said it,” the student told The Tab.Black university applicants 21 times more likely to face scrutinyHe said he asked the member of staff to let him in to the library after he forgot his student card – and then as he walked in, the security guard allegedly made the remark to a colleague. “He proceeded to let me in then turned to his colleague as I walked away and said ‘You know I get right annoyed with that monkey’, referring to me as the ‘monkey’,” the final year student said. He reported the incident to the university on Monday to raise awareness of racism on campus. The incident comes after a banana was reportedly thrown at a black Sheffield Hallam graduate during an ice hockey match between his alma mater and city rivals, the University of Sheffield. Students are planning to protest in Sheffield on Friday over the handling of racism on campus. Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain

Last month, two 18-year-old males were arrested after a Nottingham Trent University student posted video footage of racist chants in her student halls. A black student captured two males chanting “We hate the blacks” outside her bedroom door.Members of a student law society at the University of Exeter were suspended after private WhatsApp conversations containing racist comments were shared on social media.And earlier this month, Sheffield Hallam University launched an investigation after a rotten banana was reportedly thrown at a black graduate student during an ice hockey match.On the latest figures, Mr Lammy, the former Labour higher education minister, said: “Questions clearly have to be asked about what is behind this disproportionality within the Ucas verification system, and why applications made by black students are more likely to be flagged and investigated.“The evidence suggests that unconscious bias may well be a factor.”Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, said: “This shocking practice highlights just how pervasive institutional racism is across the higher education sector. Ucas has been completely unable to justify this discriminatory practice. “Ucas must urgently investigate this and make clear what steps will be taken to end the racial profiling of students.”Fraud and similarity detection software, as well as input from universities, are used when deciding whether an application needs investigating. The process looks out for a variety of things – including fake qualifications, plagiarised personal statements and inaccurate information.Since the findings have come to light Ucas has said it will publish data, showing the gender and race of applicants flagged, to the public annually – with the first figures expected next month.The total number of applications cancelled after investigation is small. But these figures do not take into account applications that have been withdrawn by the prospective student themselves. One prospective black student told The Independent that he decided to pull out of the application process after he found Ucas’s investigation to be “intimidating”. Samuel Babarinde, who had his application flagged by Ucas during this academic year, said: “I have been very emotionally distressed by this whole process. I felt I had been singled out. “It felt like I was already guilty before being found guilty. It was intimidating and frustrating.”We need to start addressing the problem of racism in universitiesHalf of UK students have witnessed racism at university, says surveyUniversity investigates racism claims after banana thrown at graduateNUS black students officer Ilyas Nagdee said: “I am almost lost for words in being able to understand how something like that has been allowed to take place. “And how a process – which many people thought of as just being the vehicle to university applications – is also fuelling prejudice.“It will make a lot of people lose trust in Ucas, so they urgently have to take steps to rectify that. Helen Thorne, external relations director at Ucas, said: “I am not aware of any way really that unconscious bias could creep into this. Our fraud and verification team have equality and ersity training as well.”However, Ucas will be carrying out research to understand what is driving the higher figures – and the organisation expects to publish these findings in a report alongside the data.Ms Thorne added: “If it shows that there is an issue – we don’t know today whether there is an issue – then we will also set out what we will do about it.”Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is what that signifiesInstead, the judge said the best Alfie\u0027s parents could hope for was to explore the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home.But a doctor treating Alfie, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that for Alfie to be allowed home would require a sea change in attitude from the child\u0027s family, and they feared that in the worst case they would try to take the boy abroad.Mr Justice Hayden ruled out his family\u0027s wishes to take the child to the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, following interventions from the Pope and the Italian authorities.Alfie has been at the centre of a life or death treatment battle, with his parents, Mr Evans and Kate James, trying to block doctors from withdrawing life support in a sometimes acrimonious six-month dispute which has seen a series of court battles.A last-ditch appeal in which the Italian Ambassador granted Alfie citizenship of Italy in order to take him to Rome for treatment failed on Monday.And a late night court hearing heard by telephone by Mr Justice Hayden and lawyers for both sides confirmed his earlier decision permitting life support, helping Alfie to breathe, to be withdrawn.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA statue in honour of the first female Suffragette Millicent Fawcett is unveiled as Prime Minister Theresa May and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan look on during a ceremony in Parliament Square.

It\u0027s beyond belief,” Ms Bearder said.The app, Home Secretary Amber Rudd pledged would be easy to use, will not function on iPhones because they do not have the capability to read the chip in a biometric passport.The revelation is likely to further lower the opinion of British immigration authorities in the eyes of European politicians and citizens, hot on the heels of damage done by the Windrush immigration scandal and erroneous deportation letters being sent to EU nationals last year.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Speaking after the Tuesday meeting Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator who requested the official visit to Brussels by the Home Office, said he would be writing to UK authorities to resolve various “question marks” about the registration process.The European Parliament says any system should be by way of “declaration” rather than application that the UK government would have to process. MEPs also want the system to be free for EU citizens living in the UK, on the basis that they had no part in the Brexit decision.Mr Verhofstadt also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

If there wasn’t Brexit there shouldn’t be a special status for EU citizens in the future and there wouldn’t be a reason to apply for such a status.”He also added that each family of EU nationals should only have to make one declaration instead of one for each person in it, and that there needed to be special provisions for vulnerable people or those not able to use a digital registration system.The parliament also insisted that British citizens living abroad at the point of exit should be guaranteed full rights to freedom of movement across the EU rather than just for the country they’re currently resided in. One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?European confidence in British immigration authorities reached a new low following the Windrush scandal, but it was already dealt a blow last year after the Home Office accidentally sent letters to some EU citizens telling them they had no right to remain in the country.Ms May described the false deportation notices as an “unfortunate error” on the part of the Home Office and later sent other letters to EU nationals pleading for them to remain in “open and erse” Britain.Brexit negotiators ‘gave EU power to freeze UK out of Galileo project’Theresa May dismisses EU claims that the UK is delaying Brexit talksUK holding up Brexit talks with lack of clarity, Michel Barnier says Lords defeats government plans to scrap EU rights charter after BrexitEU agrees new trade deal with Mexico as Brexit loomsPound sterling falls to five week low against US dollar The prime minister and home secretary, Amber Rudd, have come under significant pressure after it was revealed that Home Office has been threatening to deport British residents, and their descendants, who arrived from the Commonwealth before 1973.Often children who travelled on a parent’s passport did not have to go through the same administrative process as their mother or father, meaning they lacked some documentary evidence in later life to prove their arrival.Problems reached crisis point amid the “hostile environment” policy instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary, which saw officials across all wings of government and even private landlords required to demand proof of immigration status before providing services.A raft of cases are now emerging of people who have every right to live in the UK being denied jobs, homes, medical treatment and even being threatened with removal because they have not had the right documents.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

She is carrying out the will of the British people but it’s hard to read what level of enthusiasm she has for it.“She is doing it, she has never indicated anything other than that, she said ‘Brexit means Brexit’, but she doesn’t – by her nature – express herself unduly emotionally.”He said it was a “good thing” that the leader can exercise “self control”, but his words come as Brexiteers seek to pressure Ms May into sticking to her commitment to leave the customs union.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Male blue monkeys, she added, probably arrived later after being kicked out of their own groups on reaching sexual maturity.“I kept coming back to the idea that if they are only supposed to mate with their own kind, then why did these red-tailed monkeys mate with the blue monkeys, especially if they had males of their own species around,” Prof Detwiler said. “The female red-tailed monkeys present as willing partners and they are not coerced or forced into copulation with blue monkeys.“Apparently, some female red-tailed monkeys were attracted to novel males with different faces and welcomed the sexual advances.”The research involved analysing DNA from the faeces of the primates.Zhongzhong and HuahuaChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences         Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of SciencesQiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences    Qiang Sun and Mu-ming Poo, Chinese Academy of Sciences              Now Prof Detwiler believes studying how the two species have co-existed and merged could help in understanding hybridisation in general.She said the society provides “an amazing laboratory in nature to help us answer many questions about how species boundaries are maintained.She added: This research is very timely because hybridization often occurs in response to environmental changes, as we are seeing with climate change and modified landscapes—it is nature\u0027s way to respond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A traditional jaunt to the seaside remains a firm favourite, with 55 per cent flocking to Britain\u0026rsquos beaches this year.For the fourth consecutive year, Cornwall tops the chart as Britain\u0026rsquos top holiday destination. Devon takes second position and Bournemouth third.The UK\u0026rsquos rural landscape is also seen as a jewel of our national heritage and is the second most popular destination for a summer holiday for many Britons.This year, a third of adults are taking a rural break, with the top destinations the Lake District, Scottish Highlands and the Cotswolds.\u0026nbsp                Holidays 2018: Cheapest staycation in the UK revealed                Brexit news: UK staycations soar with this being a popular destinationMany Britons are swapping Lake Como for the Lake DistrictCity breaks are the third most popular type of holidays, with London, Edinburgh and Bath being top destinations this year. The annual holiday report by Travelodge surveyed 3,000 British adults, and found the UK tourist industry is flourishing.Shakila Ahmed, of Travelodge, said: \u0026ldquoOur annual holiday index confirms that we have become a staycation nation. \u0026ldquoMore Britons than ever are exploring what makes Great Britain so great, which is great news for our economy. We are seeing more Britons booking three-in-one holidays. This includes taking a city, rural and coastal break as part of a one-week holiday. Britons are also taking shorter breaks, with the average length of the summer staycation now just one week. But while choosing to remain on home soil, the study shows British holidaymakers are spoiling themselves, splashing out a little extra on their summer break. Bournemouth is perennially popular for UK touristsThe average spend on this year\u0026rsquos stay at home vacation will be \u0026pound823 \u0026ndash an increase of 37 per cent from last year. It is also the highest spend since Travelodge started its annual holiday index in 2011, when the average spend was \u0026pound399. The research also found 85 per cent of us now take three staycation breaks a year on average. The report also revealed that 38 per cent of Britons want to holiday in the UK rather than Europe in order to support their economy. The UK\u0026rsquos top staycationers are from Newcastle, with 82 per cent from the city revealing they are taking a staycation break this summer, with the average spend at \u0026pound762. People from Wolverhampton took second place, with 77 per cent of residents spending \u0026pound788 on their staycation summer break.\u0026nbspSeparate studies have revealed that our holiday choices tend to be governed by when we were born. Millennials \u0026ndash those aged between 16 and 34 \u0026ndash tend to still shun staycations. While most other age groups are increasingly taking advantage of the chance to holiday at home, figures from Visit England show this younger generation still prefer to go abroad. The tourist board statistics showed that, while more and more of us like to holiday at home, the number of millennials choosing a staycation has dropped by 1.4 million over the past decade. As a result, only a quarter of those who took a home holiday last year was aged between 16 and 34.Bosinver Farm occupies a 30-acre farm and woodland site close to the sea near Saint Austell                    Bosinver1 of 12Exterior of the stunning Coliza cottage, perfect for couples"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-950789.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon slammed brexit devolution deal independence grievances snp brexit news","story":"  PANicola Sturgeon\u0027s Brexit stance came under fire todayNicola Sturgeon was also accused of overruling her own Brexit Minister amid claims he was ready to back an agreement last week.Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said significant concessions from the UK Government would protect devolution.Scottish Tories said his comments were devastating for the truculent SNP and exposed Ms Sturgeon\u0027s desire for another referendum on breaking up Britain.The party\u0027s constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins branded the First Minister alone and isolated in her belligerence.
