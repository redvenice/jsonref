I am a man. The worst? I\u0027m actually proud to be a man and I like being masculineI have a confession to make.This isn’t easy, and I’ve taken a long time to summons up the strength to do it.I’m aware that just by admitting to what I’m about to admit, I will subject myself to all manner of global shame and ridicule.I’ll be taunted, abused, shunned and reviled.But as Sir Winston Churchill once so rightly said: ‘You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.’OK, here goes…I am a man.Yes, on International Men’s Day 2018, I am hereby identifying as the biological sex that I was born to.This alone is enough to risk making me a social pariah these days, but that’s not even the worst of it.I’m a man who’s actually proud of being a man, and who also likes being MASCULINE.Sorry.I realise this is a horrendous thing to say, and I can only offer my insincere apologies to all the radical feminists now exploding with rage as they read my shocking statement.If there’s one thing they loathe even more than the M-word, it’s the longer M-word.But why?Masculinity simply means ‘having qualities or appearances traditionally associated with men.’That’s it, nothing more sinister.Yet thanks to women of radical feminist persuasion who’ve gleefully hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexicon.And it’s now impossible to be ‘masculine’ without also being accused of ‘toxic masculinity’.          Radical feminists (here\u0027s Madonna in her shirt touting her \u0027radical\u0027 position) have hijacked the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns to serve their own man-hating purpose, masculinity has become the most controversial, detestable word in the English lexiconEven Prince Charming whisking Cinderella off from captive hell to a life of happiness is an evil that must be expunged from society – led by furious Keira Knightley and her ultra feminist knights in PC armour.‘Cinderella waits for a rich guy to rescue her,’ she sneered. ‘Don’t. Rescue yourself! Obviously!’Fine empowering words until you remember that the Prince gallantly saved Cinderella from abuse and slavery and they genuinely loved each other.Then it doesn’t seem quite so ‘obvious’, does it?One of the very worst of the many terrible things about radical feminism is the scourge of pathetic male virtue-signallers that urge them on.As an obvious (or so I thought..) tongue-in-cheek joke this morning, I tweeted: ‘Happy #InternationalMensDay! Stay strong lads, we’re not illegal – yet.’Most people reacted in the way I would react if someone else had tweeted that – by laughing.Others weren’t so amused, bombarding me with hateful abuse about my supposed ‘toxic masculinity’.A man named Box Brown, who has a verified Twitter account and claims to be a New York Times best-selling cartoonist, replied simply: ‘Die.’How laughably hypocritical this angry little clown races to attack what he presumably perceives to be my aggressive maleness, yet does so by saying he wants me dead.Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism.The likes of Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have both built hugely lucrative careers out of stripping off in the supposed name of ‘feminist empowerment’.          Hypocrisy is sadly a prevalent theme with much of modern feminism. Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratajkowski have built lucrative careers out of stripping off for ‘feminist empowerment’When in fact what they’re really doing is selling nudity and sex.I have no problem with that - just don’t pretend it benefits any other woman or is anything that Emmeline Pankhurst and her Suffragettes would have ever done.They were too busy risking their lives to win women the right to vote, than to have time to writhe naked in spaghetti and ludicrously claim they were doing so to liberate womankind.When I say this kind of thing, women ask me to cite an example of what I consider real feminist empowerment.So let me give you one from yesterday, when a 17-year old German girl driver named Sophia Flörsch was competing in her first Formula 3 World Cup race at the Macau Grand Prix.The race featured male and female drivers, and she qualified purely on merit.On the fourth lap, she struck another driver’s car as she approached a bend at 175mph.The collision caused Sophia’s car to spin out of control and catapult several hundred yards through the air into a wall.It’s the most horrifying car crash I have ever seen, and everyone who watches it would presume she must have died.But Sophia lived, despite fracturing her spine."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/19/01/05FD47FA000003E8-0-image-m-24_1542590810747.jpg","title":"Royal Academy Music wrong sack professor 59 calling violinists gypos","story":"    Prof Francesca Carpos-Young sent lecture notes to 800 students at the Royal Academy of Music in which she referred to violinists as \u0027gypos\u0027She  also described the string section as \u0027pond life\u0027 who were tea drinkers.The internationally renowned bassoonist, 59, was fired within 24 hours after her comments were shared on social media. But the tribunal ruled that her comments were taken out of context after the professor explained that she was referring to derogatory terms musicians are referred to.The comments sent some students into meltdown with one describing them as \u0027shameful stereotyping - descriptions of sexism and racism which are not acceptable under any circumstances.\u0027The student said the term \u0027gypos\u0027  is \u0027categorically racist\u0027.\u0027I\u0027m going to kill you f****t\u0027: Man fined $10,000 for...Cheating partners are three times more likely to stray...Home sellers lose confidence and slash £5,000 off house...Share this articleHe said describing the orchestra as \u0027the boys\u0027, suggested that orchestras are only made up of males - which is \u0027extremely damaging\u0027, especially with regard to the current global climate on issues of sexism.\u0027 Chair Judge Sarah Goodman ruled Prof Carpos-Young\u0027s comments had been taken out of context.She said: \u0027They were ironic in tone, intended to covey the real world in which instrumentalists and singers would have to find work and build a career, and how to behave to get on in precarious world of sessional booking.\u0027          In the lecture notes she said the orchestra might be referred to as \u0027the boys\u0027. The professor is pictured with the singer Sir Tom JonesThe Royal Academy criticised her for not \u0027framing\u0027 them first - in other words, explaining exactly what she meant.But Judge Goodman said: \u0027At most the claimant can be accused of foolishness in failing to anticipate how a superficial readership might wrench some of the terms out of context and manufacture a sense of outrage that was entirely disproportionate (on a plain reading of her notes and email) to the document\u0027s plain intent.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young, who has played for some of the best orchestras in the world, told the central London tribunal she was raising awareness of inequality in her industry.She accused the academy - which boasts Sir Elton John among its former students - of \u0027concealing\u0027 discrimination within its ranks.          Dr Francesca Carpos-Young arrives at the Central London Employment Tribunal. The tribunal ruled she was wrongfully fired as her remarks were taken out of contextThe professor, who is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, said the notes were referencing findings she had made interviewing more than 100 musicians for her PhD over discrimination in their industry.In a written ruling employment Judge Goodman and colleagues upheld her claims for wrongful dismissal and victimisation.Prof Carpos-Young could now get her old job back - which she is demanding. This will be discussed at a remedy hearing when compensation will be agreed.Her notes read: \u0027Everyone knows that having a good reputation is important. But how do you get one?\u0027At the very least, you need to consider the following tips: \u0027Be discreet what\u0027s on tour stays on tour. Become familiar with shared understanding of anecdote, caricature, stereotype and jokes.\u0027Google them and look on YouTube, if this is not your culture. For example, you may hear terms like this: Pond life  (string players). Gypos (short for gypsies)  violinists specifically\u0027.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young told the tribunal: \u0027The notes contained some of the discriminatory language my PhD research showed professional musicians had used.\u0027The terms illuminated ways some iniduals in the industry * engage in conduct which would in my view be unlawful because it is discriminatory.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young said she circulated her notes to the student body at the request of deputy principal Tim Jones. Three students complained one of whom, named as Dan Shao, posted them on social media.Soon other students piled in to complain, one writing: \u0027I was extremely shocked. I feel certain areas of this document are completely inappropriate and offensive.\u0027For example terminology of violins as gypos, look young, be clubbable* To highlight but a few!\u0027Another said: \u0027 I do not want to be advised on keeping my head down, be told brass players got drunk and string players are bores who can be found drinking tea\u0027But wait, doesn\u0027t that mean they don\u0027t appear \u0027young, up together and cool\u0027? But maybe they are still \u0027clubbable\u0027, whatever that is supposed to mean\u0027.Of the term \u0027gypos\u0027 they wrote: \u0027I can\u0027t even imagine how actual violinists who happen to be Sinti or Roma feel about it.\u0027This list is a manual for how to behave like an arsehole. I expect Francesca to apologise for sending this out.\u0027The tribunal heard 58 students then signed an open letter saying: \u0027Clearly Fran\u0027s letter is not an exception to an otherwise idyllic and welcoming environment but rather a symptom of a much broader and deeper failure to live up to institutional aims regarding equality and ersity.\u0027Prof Carpos-Young was fired for gross misconduct for \u0027bringing the academy into disrepute.\u0027Professor Jones said he only decided to sack her mid-way through their meeting on November 3 last year after she became \u0027confrontational\u0027.The tribunal said the good feedback from her lecture may have lulled her into thinking her comments would be \u0027read as intended.\u0027Judge Goodman said: \u0027Some (a very small proportion) of the content was provocative, an old pedagogical technique to stimulate interest.\u0027On the other hand, she was a woman of mature judgement, who had been in education in London, at least part-time, for some years, and so familiar with the culture of protest and activism in which isolated terms can be seized on and misrepresented by a minority as condoning or encouraging the behaviour it describes, all magnified in influence by social media.\u0027To that extent only - that she should have considered more carefully how her words might read if taken without introduction to the lecture material and out of context, and should have edited them with that in mind - was she in any way negligent in her duties as a lecturer and so at fault in contributing to what occurred.\u0027The tribunal concluded there should be a reduction in her award - of \u0027not more than ten percent\u0027 - to reflect this lack of judgement in failing to anticipate how her notes might be read by a younger generation.Prof Carpos-Young had only been hired by the academy, whose patron is the Queen, two months earlier. The presidency is held by the Duchess of Gloucester and was formerly held by Princess Diana.She said: \u0027Tim said that I had brought the academy into disrepute.\u0027He said that sending the document without context and bringing the academy into serious disrepute was gross misconduct and that he was terminating my employment with immediate effect. He told me that I wasn\u0027t going to receive any notice pay.\u0027This came like a bolt out of the blue for me. I was extremely shocked and hadn\u0027t expected anything like this.The professor\u0027s claims of whistle-blowing and sexual discrimination were dismissed  - but she won on the grounds of wrongful dismissal, victimisation and failure to be accompanied at a hearing.  "},{"url":null,"title":"No no Brazilian man cries help tried mugging female jiu jitsu novice","story":"    An aspiring flight attendant from Brazil took matters into her own hands and prevented a cell phone thief from escaping by placing an arm-bar on him for almost 20 minutes before cops arrived to make the arrest          Magdeel da Silva was placed into an arm-lock and could be heard crying for help after he and an accomplice tried stealing a cell phone from a woman in BrazilLeites, who is studying to be a flight attendant and holds a white belt in the mixed martial arts sport, decided to defend herself since four cell phones had already been stolen in prior home invasions, according to Brazilian news outlet D24AM. Da Silva\u0027s unidentified cohort managed to escape on the motorcycle and da Silva himself tried to make a run for it as well.Leites\u0027 neighbor saw the mugging attempt and ran the teenage criminal over with his car.Horrific footage captures men and women throwing bottles,...Shocking moment a man gets sucker punched by a thug as he...Share this articleThe young woman then used one of the most common jiu-jitsu techniques to keep da Silva from escaping the scene, keeping it steady for 20 minutes until the cops arrived.\u0027When you have the technique you  know how to act in a situation of immobilization because all this is a technique of immobilization,\u0027 Leites said.Despite utilizing her acquired mixed martial arts training to fend off the attack - she told news outlet G1 she tossed the phone inside the home - Leites understood the dangers behind her decision to go up against two dangerous men.

He turned the situation to his advantage by interviewing them.

Deke, pictured on BBC Three Counties Radio, said his interest in radio was sparked by pirate station Radio Caroline, which broadcast off the coast of Essex in the 1960s          Deke set up Radio 77 - named after a job-lot of second hand jingles bought from an American station of the same name.

The Prince of Prussie, Wilhelm II, who was Queen Victoria\u0027s grandson, is also depicted in the collection Following his death, she carried on collecting photos in a bid to cure her \u0027loneliness\u0027 as she came to terms with widowhood.The album remained in the Royal Collection until the 1970s when it passed into the hands of a private collector who has now consigned it for sale with auctioneers Bonhams. It is tipped to sell for £6,000 on November 27.Matthew Haley, director of books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said: \u0027Queen Victoria was fascinated by photography which was still a relatively new technology and she was very aware of her public image so she allowed herself to be photographed often.\u0027Prince Albert shared this passion and they spent much time together assembling photograph albums - a hobby she turned to again in her widowhood to help allay her loneliness.\u0027There are photos of all the prominent Royals including Victoria\u0027s children and grandchildren, as well as her royal servant John Brown.\u0027The present collection is especially valuable in that it bridges the period between 1859 - when Albert was still alive - and her widowhood in the 1860s.\u0027   "},{"url":null,"title":"Tiny house expanding roof slides reveal STOREY goes sale 125 000","story":"    The tiny home is made by New York-based Tiny Houses NYC and is on sale for $125,000          The mobile house, which is called Devasa, comprises around 300 sq ft (28 sq m) of floorspace           The stairway incorporates storage space underneath and leads to the second floor where there are two bedrooms          The house is deceptively spacious and has 6.5 ft (2 meter)-high ceilings upstairs when the roof is extendedIncredible images show the unfurnished interior with wood-panelled walls and a wooden floor as well as stairs leading to the second floor. Other shots show the tiny home from outside in its normal guise and with the roof extended to allow access upstairs.  Devasa comprises around 300 sq ft (28 sq m) of floorspace, with a cosy living room, kitchen and a bathroom with a shower, sink, and composting toilet. Power and water come from standard RV-style hookups.           The kitchen has no appliances fitted, although it does have  storage cabinets and a working sink          The 300-square-foot portable home is the work of the family-owned tiny house designers behind Tiny House NYC          It can sleep four and has a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom with a compost toilet           While slide-out spacing saving features are commonplace these days, the slide-up mechanism on Devasa means that the portable home that can sleep a family of four, yet can still be within the legal height for towingDolce \u0026 Gabbana is accused of racism over new advert showing...Golden retriever named Bowie is hailed as a hero after...Share this articleA storage-integrated staircase leads to two upstairs double bedrooms. The expandable roof mechanism runs from a 12 V car battery attached to a motor by the trailer\u0027s tongue, which operates four screw jacks on each corner of the house, but can also be operated manually. Devasa measures 23.5 ft (7.16 m)-long and 12.5 ft (3.81 m)-tall when in the lowered position and 17 ft (5.1 m)-tall when raised, with 6.5 ft (2 m)-high ceilings upstairs.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book. We need Vimes now more than ever…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It found a 60-inch 4K LG TV, advertised at £799 by Amazon on Black Friday, was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.A Sony Cyber-shot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, was found to be £10 cheaper at least 27 times in June and July 2017 and £10 or more cheaper at least 43 times in the six months following Black Friday.Amazon told Which?: “We offer many thousands of incredible deals around Black Friday representing millions of pounds of savings for our customers across a vast selection of products.”Currys PC World said it communicated clearly to shoppers by stating exactly when a product was available for a higher price: “While our prices – like all retailers – can fluctuate throughout the year, we’re proud to offer our price promise across our entire range – and this covers the Black Friday trading period.”A John Lewis spokesperson said that prices were matched throughout the year as part of its “never knowingly undersold” commitment under which it matches competitors’ prices throughout the year.An Argos spokesperson said: “During Black Friday our customers benefit from a huge range of deals on a wide range of products, all at the same time. This does not exclude these products from other promotions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1606647f11b8f277e8a06a31ebe83974dc126703/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=308ce79445832785c5c9295f03b8b420","title":"bleak christmas non food retailers uk high street shopping","story":"Good news for food shops but other high-street outlets may suffer as consumers go online Online shopping and food retailers are forecast to be the winners this Christmas as consumers keep a tight rein on spending on clothing, homewares and other non-food items.The figures signal further bad news for clothing and homeware specialists who are already under pressure as a result of a limp housing market and low consumer confidence linked to the uncertainties of Brexit, alongside rising costs from business rates and the switch to home deliveries.The independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said trading had been awful across the high street in recent weeks as the mild weather combined with a lull in trading for retailers that were not participating in early Black Friday discounting.“In 35 years, I have never known a Christmas trading period out of step with the preceding months. I said at the outset, this year has been the most challenging we have seen.He expected Christmas to be “not a disaster but not enough to rescue the growing number of weaker players finding the intensity of trade and pace of change too quick”.But Richard Perks, the director of retail research at Mintel, said high-street operators could breathe a sigh of relief that sales growth would continue.“While there’s been much talk of how the high street is being undermined by online retailing, it still only represents a relatively small part of overall retail sales, with most shopping still taking place in physical stores.”He blamed clothing retailers’ difficulties on their failure to keep up with changing consumer demands.“Many of the clothing retailers have performed badly in the face of competition from online players. While plenty of clothing retailers have performed well (TK Maxx and a raft of smaller ones including Superdry and Seasalt), too many have gone risk averse, rather than realising that, to succeed in the current market, they cannot afford to play it safe,” Perks said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0dd320bc41c0cda02c61aca6302309bf2254519/156_780_2993_1795/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b93f16afea135f8b9b7e131dd6604ab","title":"high score low pay gamification lyft uber drivers ride hailing gig economy","story":"Using ratings, competitions and bonuses to incentivise workers isn’t new – but as I found when I became a Lyft driver, the gig economy is taking it to another level. By  Sarah MasonIn May 2016, after months of failing to find a traditional job, I began driving for the ride-hailing company Lyft. I was enticed by an online advertisement that promised new drivers in the Los Angeles area a $500 “sign-up bonus” after completing their first 75 rides. The calculation was simple: I had a car and I needed the money. So, I clicked the link, filled out the application, and, when prompted, drove to the nearest Pep Boys for a vehicle inspection. I received my flamingo-pink Lyft emblems almost immediately and, within a few days, I was on the road.Initially, I told myself that this sort of gig work was preferable to the nine-to-five grind. It would be temporary, I thought. Plus, I needed to enrol in a statistics class and finish my graduate school applications – tasks that felt impossible while working in a full-time desk job with an hour-long commute. But within months of taking on this readily available, yet strangely precarious form of work, I was weirdly drawn in.Lyft, which launched in 2012 as Zimride before changing its name a year later, is a car service similar to Uber, which operates in about 300 US cities and expanded to Canada (though so far just in one province, Ontario) last year. Every week, it sends its drivers a personalised “Weekly Feedback Summary”. This includes passenger comments from the previous week’s rides and a freshly calculated driver rating. It also contains a bar graph showing how a driver’s current rating “stacks up” against previous weeks, and tells them whether they have been “flagged” for cleanliness, friendliness, navigation or safety.At first, I looked forward to my summaries for the most part, they were a welcome boost to my self-esteem. My rating consistently fluctuated between 4.89 stars and 4.96 stars, and the comments said things like: “Good driver, positive attitude” and “Thanks for getting me to the airport on time!!” There was the occasional critique, such as “She weird”, or just “Attitude”, but overall, the comments served as a kind of positive reinforcement mechanism. I felt good knowing that I was helping people and that people liked me.But one week, after completing what felt like a million rides, I opened my feedback summary to discover that my rating had plummeted from a 4.91 (“Awesome”) to a 4.79 (“OK”), without comment. Stunned, I combed through my ride history trying to recall any unusual interactions or disgruntled passengers. Nothing. What happened? What did I do? I felt sick to my stomach.Because driver ratings are calculated using your last 100 passenger reviews, one logical solution is to crowd out the old, bad ratings with new, presumably better ratings as fast as humanly possible. And that is exactly what I did.For the next several weeks, I deliberately avoided opening my feedback summaries. I stocked my vehicle with water bottles, breakfast bars and miscellaneous mini candies to inspire riders to smash that fifth star. I developed a borderline-obsessive vacuuming habit and upped my car-wash game from twice a week to every other day. I experimented with different air-fresheners and radio stations. I drove and I drove and I drove.The language of choice, freedom, and autonomy saturate discussions of ride hailing. “On-demand companies are pointing the way to a more promising future, where people have more freedom to choose when and where they work,” Travis Kalanick, the founder and former CEO of Uber, wrote in October 2015. “Put simply,” he continued, “the future of work is about independence and flexibility.”In a certain sense, Kalanick is right. Unlike employees in a spatially fixed worksite (the factory, the office, the distribution centre), rideshare drivers are technically free to choose when they work, where they work and for how long. They are liberated from the constraining rhythms of conventional employment or shift work. But that apparent freedom poses a unique challenge to the platforms’ need to provide reliable, “on demand” service to their riders – and so a driver’s freedom has to be aggressively, if subtly, managed. One of the main ways these companies have sought to do this is through the use of gamification.Simply defined, gamification is the use of game elements – point-scoring, levels, competition with others, measurable evidence of accomplishment, ratings and rules of play – in non-game contexts. Games deliver an instantaneous, visceral experience of success and reward, and they are increasingly used in the workplace to promote emotional engagement with the work process, to increase workers’ psychological investment in completing otherwise uninspiring tasks, and to influence, or “nudge”, workers’ behaviour. This is what my weekly feedback summary, my starred ratings and other gamified features of the Lyft app did.But colour-coding checkout screens is a pretty rudimental kind of gamification. In the world of ride-hailing work, where almost the entirety of one’s activity is prompted and guided by screen – and where everything can be measured, logged and analysed – there are few limitations on what can be gamified.In 1974, Michael Burawoy, a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Chicago and a self-described Marxist, began working as a miscellaneous machine operator in the engine ision of Allied Corporation, a large manufacturer of agricultural equipment. He was attempting to answer the following question: why do workers work as hard as they do?In Marx’s time, the answer to this question was simple: coercion. Workers had no protections and could be fired at will for failing to fulfil their quotas. One’s ability to obtain a subsistence wage was directly tied to the amount of effort one applied to the work process. However, in the early 20th century, with the emergence of labour protections, the elimination of the piece-rate pay system, the rise of strong industrial unions and a more robust social safety net, the coercive power of employers waned.Yet workers continued to work hard, Burawoy observed. They co-operated with speed-ups and exceeded production targets. They took on extra tasks and sought out productive ways to use their downtime. They worked overtime and off the clock. They kissed ass. After 10 months at Allied, Burawoy concluded that workers were willingly and even enthusiastically consenting to their own exploitation. What could explain this? One answer, Burawoy suggested, was “the game”.For Burawoy, the game described the way in which workers manipulated the production process in order to reap various material and immaterial rewards. When workers were successful at this manipulation, they were said to be “making out”. Like the levels of a video game, operators needed to overcome a series of consecutive challenges in order to make out and beat the game.At the beginning of every shift, operators encountered their first challenge: securing the most lucrative assignment from the “scheduling man”, the person responsible for doling out workers’ daily tasks. Their next challenge was a trip to “the crib” to find the blueprint and tooling needed to perform the operation. If the crib attendant was slow to dispense the necessary blueprints, tools and fixtures, operators could lose a considerable amount of time that would otherwise go towards making or beating their quota. (Burawoy won the cooperation of the crib attendant by gifting him a Christmas ham.) After facing off against the truckers, who were responsible for bringing stock to the machine, and the inspectors, who were responsible for enforcing the specifications of the blueprint, the operator was finally left alone with his machine to battle it out against the clock.According to Burawoy, production at Allied was deliberately organised by management to encourage workers to play the game. When work took the form of a game, Burawoy observed, something interesting happened: workers’ primary source of conflict was no longer with the boss. Instead, tensions were dispersed between workers (the scheduling man, the truckers, the inspectors), between operators and their machines, and between operators and their own physical limitations (their stamina, precision of movement, focus).The battle to beat the quota also transformed a monotonous, soul-crushing job into an exciting outlet for workers to exercise their creativity, speed and skill. Workers attached notions of status and prestige to their output, and the game presented them with a series of choices throughout the day, affording them a sense of relative autonomy and control. It tapped into a worker’s desire for self-determination and self-expression. Then, it directed that desire towards the production of profit for their employer.Every Sunday morning, I receive an algorithmically generated “challenge” from Lyft that goes something like this: “Complete 34 rides between the hours of 5am on Monday and 5am on Sunday to receive a $63 bonus.” I scroll down, concerned about the declining value of my bonuses, which once hovered around $100-$220 per week, but have now dropped to less than half that.“Click here to accept this challenge.” I tap the screen to accept. Now, whenever I log into driver mode, a stat meter will appear showing my progress: only 21 more rides before I hit my first bonus. Lyft does not disclose how its weekly ride challenges are generated, but the value seems to vary according to anticipated demand and driver behaviour. The higher the anticipated demand, the higher the value of my bonus. The more I hit my bonus targets or ride quotas, the higher subsequent targets will be. Sometimes, if it has been a while since I have logged on, I will be offered an uncharacteristically lucrative bonus, north of $100, though it has been happening less and less of late.Behavioural scientists and video game designers are well aware that tasks are likely to be completed faster and with greater enthusiasm if one can visualise them as part of a progression towards a larger, pre-established goal. The Lyft stat meter is always present, always showing you what your acceptance rating is, how many rides you have completed, how far you have to go to reach your goal.Retention is a problem in large part because the economics of driving are so bad. Researchers have struggled to establish exactly how much money drivers make, but with the release of two recent reports, one from the Economic Policy Institute and one from MIT, a consensus on driver pay seems to be emerging: drivers make, on average, between $9.21 (£7.17) and $10.87 (£8.46) per hour. What these findings confirm is what many of us in the game already know: in most major US cities, drivers are pulling in wages that fall below local minimum-wage requirements. According to an internal slide deck obtained by the New York Times, Uber actually identifies McDonald’s as its biggest competition in attracting new drivers. When I began driving for Lyft, I made the same calculation most drivers make: it is better to make $9 per hour than to make nothing.Before Lyft rolled out weekly ride challenges, there was the “Power Driver Bonus”, a weekly challenge that required drivers to complete a set number of regular rides. I sometimes worked more than 50 hours per week trying to secure my PDB, which often meant driving in unsafe conditions, at irregular hours and accepting nearly every ride request, including those that felt potentially dangerous (I am thinking specifically of an extremely drunk and visibly agitated late-night passenger).Of course, this was largely motivated by a real need for a boost in my weekly earnings. But, in addition to a hope that I would somehow transcend Lyft’s crappy economics, the intensity with which I pursued my PDBs was also the result of what Burawoy observed four decades ago: a bizarre desire to beat the game.Drivers’ per-mile earnings are supplemented by a number of rewards, both material and immaterial. Uber drivers can earn “Achievement Badges” for completing a certain number of five-star rides and “Excellent Service Badges” for leaving customers satisfied. Lyft’s “Accelerate Rewards” programme encourages drivers to level up by completing a certain number of rides per month in order to unlock special rewards like fuel discounts from Shell (gold level) and free roadside assistance (platinum level).In addition to offering meaningless badges and meagre savings at the pump, ride-hailing companies have also adopted some of the same design elements used by gambling firms to promote addictive behaviour among slot-machine users. One of things the anthropologist and NYU media studies professor Natasha Dow Schüll found during a decade-long study of machine gamblers in Las Vegas is that casinos use networked slot machines that allow them to surveil, track and analyse the behaviour of inidual gamblers in real time – just as ride-hailing apps do. This means that casinos can “triangulate any given gambler’s player data with her demographic data, piecing together a profile that can be used to customise game offerings and marketing appeals specifically for her”. Like these customised game offerings, Lyft tells me that my weekly ride challenge has been “personalised just for you!”Former Google “design ethicist” Tristan Harris has also described how the “pull-to-refresh” mechanism used in most social media feeds mimics the clever architecture of a slot machine: users never know when they are going to experience gratification – a dozen new likes or retweets – but they know that gratification will eventually come. This unpredictability is addictive: behavioural psychologists have long understood that gambling uses variable reinforcement schedules – unpredictable intervals of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback – to condition players into playing just one more round.We are only beginning to uncover the extent to which these reinforcement schedules are built into ride-hailing apps. But one example is primetime or surge pricing. The phrase “chasing the pink” is used in online forums by Lyft drivers to refer to the tendency to drive towards “primetime” areas, denoted by pink-tinted heat maps in the app, which signify increased fares at precise locations. This is irrational because the likelihood of catching a good primetime fare is slim, and primetime is extremely unpredictable. The pink appears and disappears, moving from one location to the next, sometimes in a matter of minutes. Lyft and Uber have to dole out just enough of these higher-paid periods to keep people driving to the areas where they predict drivers will be needed. And occasionally – cherry, cherry, cherry – it works: after the Rose Bowl parade last year, I made in 40 minutes more than half of what I usually make in a whole day of non-stop shuttling.So, who sets the rules for all these games? It is 12.30am on a Friday night and the “Lyft drivers lounge”, a closed Facebook group for active drivers, is ided. The debate began, as many do, with an assertion about the algorithm. “The algorithm” refers to the opaque and often unpredictable system of automated, “data-driven” management employed by ride-hailing companies to dispatch drivers, match riders into Pools (Uber) or Lines (Lyft), and generate “surge” or “primetime” fares, also known as “dynamic pricing”.The algorithm is at the heart of the ride-hailing game, and of the coercion that the game conceals. In their foundational text Algorithmic Labor and Information Asymmetries: A Case Study of Uber’s Drivers, Alex Rosenblat and Luke Stark write: “Uber’s self-proclaimed role as a connective intermediary belies the important employment structures and hierarchies that emerge through its software and interface design.” “Algorithmic management” is the term Rosenblat and Stark use to describe the mechanisms through which Uber and Lyft drivers are directed. To be clear, there is no singular algorithm. Rather, there are a number of algorithms operating and interacting with one another at any given moment. Taken together, they produce a seamless system of automatic decision-making that requires very little human intervention.For many on-demand platforms, algorithmic management has completely replaced the decision-making roles previously occupied by shift supervisors, foremen and middle- to upper- level management. Uber actually refers to its algorithms as “decision engines”. These “decision engines” track, log and crunch millions of metrics every day, from ride frequency to the harshness with which inidual drivers brake. It then uses these analytics to deliver gamified prompts perfectly matched to drivers’ data profiles.Because the logic of the algorithm is largely unknown and constantly changing, drivers are left to speculate about what it is doing and why. Such speculation is a regular topic of conversation in online forums, where drivers post screengrabs of nonsensical ride requests and compare increasingly lacklustre, algorithmically generated bonus opportunities. It is not uncommon for drivers to accuse ride-hailing companies of programming their algorithms to favour the interests of the corporation. To resolve this alleged favouritism, drivers routinely hypothesise and experiment with ways to manipulate or “game” the system back.When the bars let out after last orders at 2am, demand spikes. Drivers have a greater likelihood of scoring “surge” or “primetime” fares. There are no guarantees, but it is why we are all out there. To increase the prospect of surge pricing, drivers in online forums regularly propose deliberate, coordinated, mass “log-offs” with the expectation that a sudden drop in available drivers will “trick” the algorithm into generating higher surges. I have never seen one work, but the authors of a recently published paper say that mass log-offs are occasionally successful.Viewed from another angle, though, mass log-offs can be understood as good, old-fashioned work stoppages. The temporary and purposeful cessation of work as a form of protest is the core of strike action, and remains the sharpest weapon workers have to fight exploitation. But the ability to log-off en masse has not assumed a particularly emancipatory function. Burawoy’s insights might tell us why.Gaming the game, Burawoy observed, allowed workers to assert some limited control over the labour process, and to “make out” as a result. In turn, that win had the effect of reproducing the players’ commitment to playing, and their consent to the rules of the game. When players were unsuccessful, their dissatisfaction was directed at the game’s obstacles, not at the capitalist class, which sets the rules. The inbuilt antagonism between the player and the game replaces, in the mind of the worker, the deeper antagonism between boss and worker. Learning how to operate cleverly within the game’s parameters becomes the only imaginable option. And now there is another layer interposed between labour and capital: the algorithm.After weeks of driving like a maniac in order to restore my higher-than-average driver rating, I managed to raise it back up to a 4.93. Although it felt great, it is almost shameful and astonishing to admit that one’s rating, so long as it stays above 4.6, has no actual bearing on anything other than your sense of self-worth. You do not receive a weekly bonus for being a highly rated driver. Your rate of pay does not increase for being a highly rated driver. In fact, I was losing money trying to flatter customers with candy and keep my car scrupulously clean. And yet, I wanted to be a highly rated driver.And this is the thing that is so brilliant and awful about the gamification of Lyft and Uber: it preys on our desire to be of service, to be liked, to be good. On weeks that I am rated highly, I am more motivated to drive. On weeks that I am rated poorly, I am more motivated to drive. It works on me, even though I know better. To date, I have completed more than 2,200 rides.A longer version of this article first appeared in Logic, a new magazine devoted to deepening the discourse around technology• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdeec04310a3177892901e441a494859868356de/45_0_3770_2263/master/3770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb47c6c2657772755d11bee2c76189e8","title":"artefacts reveal vikings were more urban pioneers than violent raiders ribe","story":"Excavations in Ribe, Denmark show that Viking culture was based on sophisticated production and trade. Is their brutal reputation unfair?The same excavation also found the remains of wooden homes moulds for fashioning ornaments from gold, silver and brass intricate combs made from reindeer antlers (the Viking equivalent of ivory) and amber jewellery dating to the early 700s.Even more extraordinary, however, was the discovery that these artefacts were not for home consumption by farmers, let alone itinerant raiders. Instead, the Vikings who made them lived in a settled, urban community of craftsmen, seafarers, tradesmen and, it seems, musicians. “Ribe confounds history,” says Richard Hodges, a British archaeologist and the president of the American University of Rome. “What we have here defies the opinion that all the Vikings did was to raid and to rape.”The discoveries at Ribe suggest mass production, high levels of specialisation and a ision of labour – all characteristics of a settled urban society rather than a nomadic one based on pillaging.“We can see in Ribe that Viking society was based on sophisticated production and trade,” Hodges says. “It is a paradox: they made these beautiful things, they had gorgeous cloth, wonderful artefacts, but at the same time they are known to history for their brutality.”European history has been written from the perspective of Christian chroniclers who wanted to tell us that Vikings were barbarians, Hodges notes.The evidence suggests that, over the decades before launching their infamous raids on Britain with the attack on Lindisfarne in AD793, the Vikings created one of the first post-Roman Scandinavian urban bases for world trade and exploration. The culture was based on craftsmanship and trade and helped create the basis for sweeping changes in economic life over the ensuing millennium.Speeding through the autumn countryside on one of his frequent journeys to Ribe, Søren Sindbæk, an archaeologist from Aarhus University, keeps up a constant stream of thoughts about the site’s broader historical significance. “A transformation took place in northern Europe between the end of the Roman period – when this was the dark side of the continent – and the Middle Ages, when it became a bustling region with great cities, cathedrals and commercial shipping,” says Sindbæk.“That change, leading eventually to the European age of exploration and world trade hegemony, begins here on the North Sea coast, where urban Vikings were a catalyst.”Another find is a tiny silver coin the size of a fingernail, preserved so well it could have been minted yesterday. Coinage is evidence of a stable trading community, says Morten Søvsø, chief archaeologist.“Looking at Ribe we can see there was a monopoly coin system already from the eighth century,” Søvsø says. “It’s all about trade and tax, and about keeping the peace – so people could rely on a return from their trade.”Ribe has long been known as an early trading settlement. The question posed by the latest discoveries is about the relationship between these urban Vikings and the period of raids that followed the attack on Lindisfarne – Britain’s 911 moment, as Sindbæk puts it.“The fact we can see this trading system was already in place before the Viking raids started in the British Isles makes it likely that the two things have something in common,” he says, adjusting the broad-brimmed Indiana Jones hat he keeps in the boot of his car for rainy days.“It could be that the raids were actually the tip of an iceberg of trade – there is evidence of a trading relationship with Scandinavia, but we haven’t heard about the peaceful side.”The site in Ribe is unique because it enables precise dating of the finds, thanks to deposits that have lain undisturbed in the sandy, worm-free soil. Lasers have been scanning the site as each layer of history is peeled away, creating a 3D model of the eighth century so samples can be precisely located in the archaeological record.This method has revealed that the bead-makers of Viking Ribe were early victims of globalisation. Mass-produced beads from towns such as Raqqa in present-day Syria started arriving in bulk around AD780, undercutting the local trade.The Danish archaeologists have applied another technique for squeezing every last drop of knowledge out of the site at Ribe. Blocks of soil no larger than a cigarette packet are impregnated with resin so they can be sliced into thin sections, which can then be analysed under a microscope.The dig, funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and carried out by Aarhus University with the Museum of Southwest Jutland, began in 2017 and is now complete the 100 sq metre site has returned to public use. Many discoveries lie ahead, Sindbæk says, as he and his colleagues study the data and materials they have assembled.In a corrugated hut outside the warehouse where all the finds are kept, Sara Hee and Jane Sif Hansen are engaged in the less high-tech business of sifting through bags of mud. Hee describes how the discoveries are upending prior theories that the Vikings were marauders rather than traders.A few days earlier, she says, she plucked a perfect tiny amulet from the muddy soup, marked with a Christian cross – a “huge adrenaline rush” – suggesting Christian currents were present here long before King Harald Bluetooth’s declaration on the Jelling runestone circa AD965 that he had brought the religion to the Danes.“Some written sources have presented the Vikings as barbarians in order to make themselves look good,” Hee says. “So we cannot completely trust people writing at the time: are they describing what they saw or imposing their own understanding on it?”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5892a32786dc3d1f1ec7e2e5803fb713c6a88417/0_0_1922_1440/master/1922.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7642b60278979f455bfa6853d8de137e 1010w","title":"hard right brexit tory revolution no deal eu","story":"A group of extremists within the Tory party would welcome the havoc unleashed by ‘no deal’ to advance their causeThe vultures circle a wounded prime minister, who is attacked by the hordes of extremists in her party while beset by new inconvenient facts daily exposing the damage Brexit can do. Look, the British army is preparing for the worst: emergency troops are at the ready. Operation Temperer, which usually provides soldiers for terrorist attacks, is now ordered to make 10,000 soldiers available to keep order on the streets and in shops, and to distribute emergency medicines in case of a no-deal crash-out.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products,” warns the Confederation of British Industry chief, Carolyn Fairbairn.The exasperated chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, Bob Sanguinetti, says: “Those hoping for a no-deal Brexit have a duty to explain in technical detail why this risk is worth taking.” No wonder he finds all this incomprehensible: why is there all this self-induced chaos with no war, terror, epidemic or natural disaster?What few realise is that we are living through a revolution that has been a long time brewing among Tory party entryists. Those clawing to dethrone Theresa May are of a different ilk, only just within a recognisable Tory penumbra. Infiltrators, bent on destroying from within the party that harbours them, inhabit another planet from Heath, Clarke or Heseltine – but nor are they Thatcher’s children, either. Leaving Europe is only a part of their revolutionary project, a means not an end. Because they are revolutionaries, the more dramatic the break and the wilder the chaos, the better. They are bent on the creative destruction of a stagnant old order, so as to plough up the ground for a fertile new radical right beginning. Tax-haven Singapore beckons.There is a (mercifully small) handful of leftwing Brexiters who talk the same way: the old order was bad, so bring on mayhem from which a new utopia can flourish. For both red and blue revolutionaries, any Brexit harm – bound to hurt the vulnerable – is only collateral damage in a greater cause.The recently resigned Brexit secretary Dominic Raab currently leads the betting to take over from May. Since coming into parliament in 2010, he has worked unstintingly for this day. Maybe his ministerial promotion came later than some MPs’ because his seniors could see that glint in his eye: a bit of a loner, he belongs nonetheless to a coterie of the likeminded.Their seminal work in 2012 was Britannia Unchained, written with other 2010 young turks, Liz Truss, Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Chris Skidmore. They belong to the much larger – 40 or so – Free Enterprise Group of MPs, sponsored by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which handles their media. (The IEA is under investigation by the Charity Commission after a Greenpeace investigation into US cash for ministerial access and Brexit campaigning.)The group’s website boasts of meeting a former chancellor before budgets to make proposals, “a number of which became policy”. Truss failed to get through her radical deregulation of childminders, or selling off national forests, but her fervour for slashing the state was in high demand at Tory conference fringe meetings.This cadre is so much more extreme than Thatcherism that they iconoclastically dismiss her era. “The last 30 years of public debate have been dominated by leftwing thinking,” says their book, which gained notoriety for its most famous line: “British workers are the worst idlers in the world” who “prefer a lie-in to hard work”. With that, they blamed low UK productivity on the workforce, not on a failure to invest.In his paper Weight Watchers For Whitehall, he calls for abolishing half the 20 government departments, including International Development, Business, Culture, and the “pointless government Equalities Office”. Browse his essay collection Britain, Tomorrow: the Case for Free Enterprise, Meritocracy and Liberty and you find his views on cutting worker protection and the minimum wage, for “no-fault dismissal” and tax cuts for the better off: “Middle-class Peter should not be robbed to pay working-class Paul.” Boris Johnson’s foreword calls it “a blistering collection”.On meritocracy, free schools should select as grammar schools do, which would “drive up standards in other schools”. How can you fail to admire the sheer evidence-free effrontery? “In Britain there has been too great a tendency to attribute results to fortune and background.” Evidence abounds to show how much more closely British children’s success is matched to parental incomes than in other EU countries.The great Brexit rift is a war for the nation’s soul between a radical revolutionary right and a social democracy very much under threat. The right used immigration to capture votes, but Brexit was always a proxy for a deeper project.Raab says no deal would be a “manageable situation”. Yes, they would find it useful. Just as David Cameron and George Osborne used the cover of the great crash to roll out their state-shrinking agenda, so Raab and his Free Enterprise Group would use Brexit havoc to take a yet more radical axe to the state.

The word is thrown around like confetti. But not only has the word itself now become so widely used as to have become almost meaningless, that analysis of Labour’s recent past doesn’t even make sense in its own terms.A great deal of what Tony Blair did in power was not neoliberal at all, or had neoliberal elements but was aimed in a quite different direction, or was better thought of as social democratic or even socialist. Inexpert and ersatz commentators fill far too much of our airtime and news pages with simplistic nonsense that fails to understand just how complex governing and all governments are, and which has no grasp of scale and scope – only of unconvincing and overheated rhetoric.There is no doubt that New Labour’s period in power did contain elements that we could term neoliberal. Its early centralising streak carried on the fake decentralisation of the later Thatcher and Major years, devolving responsibility without power – or much extra money. The private finance initiative financed schools and hospitals that would otherwise never have been built, but also led to some very poor value-for-money deals. With the benefit of hindsight, one of Labour’s greatest failings between 1997 and 2008 was not to have taken greater steps to increase regulation and protect the UK economy given the growing financial services sector. Although the 2008 crisis wrought far worse results in New York than London, the UK was clearly overexposed to a financial crisis anywhere in the developed world.But a closer look at the other side of the ledger is way overdue. New Labour in power accepted some private access to the functions of the state, particularly on the capital side: but it also rolled the state forward into civic society, via hugely increased employment across the third sector that was dependent on government spending. The creation of a national minimum wage and a tax credits system benefitting the low paid halted the remorseless march of inequality that had so scarred Britain in the 1980s. Some focused interventions, for instance on rough sleeping, returned life-changing results for many. The numbers of people sleeping out on England’s streets on any given night fell from 1,850 in 1998 to 440 in 2010.School performance improved markedly, especially at the bottom of the attainment distribution – and, in London, at an astonishing rate. NHS inpatient waiting lists fell from 13 weeks to four weeks between March 1997 and March 2009. The public noticed, as perceptions of school performance and NHS performance shot up.There were plenty of failings, large and small. Most of all, there was a failure of language and imagination. Far too many of the extraordinary social policy gains New Labour made in office were played down, partly because there was a restless desire to avoid complacency and make further progress, and partly because the party’s leaders feared offending the middle-class taxpayers who frightened them so much after the general election defeat of 1992. Blair’s arguments were, at their worst, technocratic, incremental, managerial: they are one of the reasons why Brexiteers and Corbynites have been able, in contradistinction, to paint their conservative and banal ideas as novel, radical and revolutionary.But all that said, New Labour in power was a party with a powerful analysis of state and society: that globalisation was inevitable, and the British people had to be educated enough, healthy enough and informed enough to stand up to it. Its kaleidoscopic array of responses was therefore Rooseveltian in its “do what works” experimentation. It deserves a rather more sensitive characterisation than just repeating the one word “neoliberalism”.That range of policies has allowed the right to say that Blair got Britain into far too much debt, and the left to say that he went too easy on modern capitalism’s concentration of wealth and power. But, in truth, that attack from both directions means that Labour’s attempt to get away from the easy dichotomies of “more” versus “less” was successfully executed while in office, and was more popular than its opponents want to admit.“Neoliberalism” is a useful boo word, but its use in this context is both crude and unhelpful. No government that rebuilt the public sphere, radically improved the state healthcare system, improved maintained schools and took on homelessness can possibly be painted only in those terms. Labour in its present shape appears to be struggling to convert the extra voters it needs to be sure of victory next time. One reason is that it is engaged in a war against its own history: if it took a more nuanced and more truthful view of Labour’s recent record, it would have a much better chance of success.• Glen O’Hara is professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfe9e2824649f1432f1c83e1380225d16655cd1/74_189_3478_2087/master/3478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4abbe32c8aad30779d7e9cd6393fe35a","title":"peoples vote eu immigration controls brexit","story":"The dramatic events of last week have significantly increased the possibility of a “people’s vote” on Brexit. The case for such a vote has become compelling because the parliamentary arithmetic points to gridlock on the agreement reached with the European commission.Theresa May’s personal demeanour, and the efforts of extreme Brexiters to scapegoat her for the probable failure of their project, have undoubtedly aroused much sympathy for her among voters. Some of that sympathy is justified. Certainly, no other Conservative leader would have been better able to resolve the contradictions of Brexit. Despite holding positions of real government power, Brexit’s main leaders have been utterly unable to offer any realistic alternative approach.However, most of the sympathy is unwarranted. The disastrous position in which this country now finds itself is the direct consequence of two fundamentally mistaken decisions that were May’s responsibility alone.The first was the strategy launched at the Conservative party conference in 2016. This was explicitly intended to ide rather than to unite the country. Despite the narrow 52-48 vote, she prioritised the dogmas of a small group of self-obsessed and introverted Conservatives ahead of the obvious economic and constitutional needs of the country. This foolish strategy drew red lines under Britain’s continued membership of the single market and customs union, as well as denying any role for the European court of justice.Her second miscalculation was to try to get that sectarian approach confirmed through a general election. But the country refused to endorse her approach, her parliamentary majority went missing and the Democratic Unionist party acquired an undeserved position of power.These two errors created the framework for the predictable labyrinthine tangle she is now experiencing. One outcome is the possibility of another referendum.However, May did get one very important thing right. She appreciated that large numbers of those who voted for Brexit did so because of concerns about free movement. Remain campaigners struggled against the simplistic mantra of “take back control” and the momentum shifted to leave when, a month before the referendum, the Office for National Statistics published the latest net migration figure of 333,000 – a record level.It is true, but doesn’t matter, that much of the concern about immigration was based on false information and dishonest marketing.Nor does it matter that Brexit wouldn’t significantly reduce immigration, nor that many leading Brexiters do not care at all about immigration numbers, only “sovereignty”.It doesn’t even matter that May’s own incompetence as home secretary fuelled many of the popular concerns. She promulgated the duplicitous target of reducing net migration to the UK to fewer than 100,000 (under her stewardship this actually increased, with a majority coming from outside the EU). Her first act as home secretary was to abolish identity cards, a central mechanism to give citizens confidence in the governance and control of migration. And she contributed nothing to reducing migration into the EU by strengthening the external Schengen border.Whatever the background, the unavoidable fact is that millions of people voted for Brexit because they felt immigration was outside their control. Their votes were decisive and would be again.As a people’s vote becomes more likely, this central political fact needs to be taken directly into account. Advocates of a new referendum should seek to heal national isions, not perpetuate and strengthen them. A new vote must not repeat May’s mistake of ignoring strongly held minority opinions.Therefore, concerns about immigration have to be properly addressed – inside or outside the EU. We suggest the following measures to control immigration more effectively should be implemented.First, we need tighter control of EU migration into the UK by applying current EU rules, which state that migrants must prove that they are either working, actively seeking work or self-sufficient. Otherwise, they can be removed after three months. Other EU countries operate a worker registration system to implement this. In a similar way, the UK should require EU migrants to register with their local authority. Those without jobs should be required to return to their country of origin.Sufficient resources for people and technology must be provided to enforce the migration rules properly.Second, we need stricter labour market controls to address unscrupulous employers using appalling and illegal labour practices to encourage people-trafficking and illegal immigration. We need proper inspection and tougher enforcement against exploitation.Recruitment agencies should not be permitted to hire directly from abroad and, in high unemployment sectors, new jobs should first be offered to local unemployed people.Third, we should re-establish a national identity system using new technology to establish secure digital identities for everyone. Among other benefits, this would make it easier to identify illegal migration.Fourth, we need to contribute to far more effective control of the EU’s external border and better-resourced European policing coordination to strengthen enforcement against human traffickers and smugglers.Fifth, in the event we remain in the EU, we need to tighten migration controls, for example by reforming the posted workers directive to ensure that companies bringing in workers from abroad pay at the local rate. An “emergency brake” system should be considered for periods of exceptionally high inflows.Sixth, we should establish a well-resourced and focused migration impact fund to help local communities manage the impact of rapid population change.This six-point approach to immigration is right on its own terms. Some of the measures previously rejected as too costly, bad for business or threats to civil liberties are nothing like as expensive or problematic as Brexit would be. We could achieve them more effectively inside, rather than outside, the EU.Those who believe that a people’s vote is the best way out of the imbroglio in which the country now finds itself should make an effective approach to controlling immigration a prominent part of the public argument that needs to be made.• Charles Clarke and Alan Johnson are former Labour home secretaries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c70b5945d6c0119a6b136d1fd7bbbcb05fc667f/0_0_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46887e06523ae3e45482377febbcf91b","title":"spoof imaginary facts bonk museum damien hirst treasures wreck unbelievable","story":"From Finland’s Bonk Museum to Damien Hirst’s deep-sea mockumentary, creators are seizing on po-faced conventions to deliver enormous porkies. What’s behind the trend?In Uusikaupunki, Finland, there is a small museum dedicated to Bonk Business Inc, a “multiglobal industrial conglomerate” specialising in anchovy products, cosmic therapy and localised black holes. The museum chronicles the history and achievements of the company in obsessive detail, displaying old advertisements and inventions dating back to 1893. On the wall hangs a corporate headshot of Sven Triloqvist, vice-president of advanced disinformation systems at Bonk Business Inc.This colourful corporation is, of course, completely fictitious. It is the work of artist and sculptor Alvar Gullichsen, who uses the format of the industrial museum to poke fun at corporate culture in a way that feels both fantastical and plausibly factual. Straight-faced tour guides encourage you to pose for photos with absurd contraptions.Meanwhile, Damien Hirst’s 2017 Venice show Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable presented the artist as a wealthy benefactor funding the retrieval and exhibition of awe-inspiring artefacts from the ocean floor. Accompanying the exhibition was a film that documents the underwater archaeology expedition. But none of it was real: the exhibition, documentary and the treasures themselves were all Hirst’s spoof creations.Fascinating things can be achieved with one foot in history and another in the imaginary. The trappings of historical documentation, or a setting that closely mirrors a place and time in the real world, can lend a flavour of authenticity to art and entertainment. Stéphane Beauverger, the narrative director of Vampyr – a 2018 video game set during London’s Spanish flu pandemic that locates a lurid tale about vampires in recognisable early 20th-century history – calls this concept “imaginary facts”.Imaginary facts, like works of historical fiction, blend the fictitious with the verifiable: they’re used to tell an artificial yet compelling story. In a landscape where “post-truth” and “alternative facts” are part of our everyday vocabulary, this term might put some on the back foot – but the crucial difference between an imaginary fact and an alternative one is that the audience is fully aware it is a pretence.To help us temporarily buy in to the proposed reality, artists use the tools and techniques of popular history: documentaries with talking heads, museum exhibitions with white labels and glass cases, hardbacks stuffed with footnoted essays, and interviews and oral histories recorded in crackling analogue. The Bonk Museum is so effective because it borrows from an academic format we’re already familiar with. Schoolchildren around the world are right this moment being bussed off to industrial museums to learn about the achievements of their nation’s economy and manufacturing sector. Industrial museums have universal characteristics: portraits of wealthy industrialists contrasted with shots of anonymous workers on the factory floor, dioramas of workspaces frozen in time, photo opportunities with obsolete machinery.The second season of podcast series Within the Wires is presented as a series of museum guides. Each episode is ostensibly a guide to a different museum or gallery. Within the Wires uses the techniques usually reserved for non-fiction to tell the jarringly surreal fictional elements of its story. To maintain the illusion, the podcast relies on subtle audio cues, such as repeated beeps that signal the point at which a museum visitor would pause the tape and move on to the next artwork.“We quickly came up with the idea of museum audio guides because it seemed like a fun challenge, as writers, to try to tell a story so obtusely,” says co-writer Jeffrey Cranor, who also helped create Welcome to Night Vale, a podcast presented as a local radio broadcast about a nonexistent town. “Once you have the form, you can figure out who your narrator is and then you can build a story around that person … What can that museum guide narrator reveal about her life and the lives of these other characters?”Sometimes these unorthodox formats can be limiting, says Cranor. “The museum season was actually the hardest of the three we’ve written so far, because of the limitations of the form.” But for him and his co-writer Janina Matthewson, they are an experimental challenge. “It gets us out of the normal mode of A-to-B storytelling: how can you give people a good story without ever actually directly telling it?” This indirect mode of storytelling puts more onus on the audience to connect the dots. It turns the show into a puzzle passed back and forth between creator and listener.The TV series Fargo, meanwhile, borrows from a different format to create the illusion of fact: true-crime drama. One of the only consistent features between seasons is the disclaimer that opens each episode: “This is a true story … At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.” The words of the disclaimer work like a repeated incantation before each episode, casting a spell that suspends our disbelief each week. The video game Mafia III also adopts the aesthetics of true crime, with expert talking heads whose insights bookend the events of the game.The thrill of imaginary facts rests on the audience being in on the deception – those taking photographs at the Bonk Museum and absorbing the month’s spooky events in Welcome to Night Vale are willing and eager dupes. As Cranor puts it, there’s something thrilling about “the humour and the horror of something that looks like and sounds predictable, but then deep down it’s just not quite right. It’s not quite real.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1579f1e8a53b6e9b58a478c4d9c28f2d5e9d62fc/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bb97e20037395a72419d5d798fcb7b2","title":"dont make gp appointment manage money universities advice helicopter parents","story":"Parents are finding it harder to let go, and universities are responding by making them ‘part of the team’As a father of five, Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of West of England, knows all about parental anxiety. Yet he says parents whose offspring have started university must learn to listen from afar without judging – even if those young adults are experimenting with drugs or drinking heavily.University may be a door to adulthood, but the parents of today’s students have wedged their feet firmly inside. With parents keen to know that the £9,250-a-year tuition fees are being spent wisely, there is now an established culture of them attending open days. And new research shows that perfectionist parents, who have grown used to managing everything at school, are often not letting go of the reins at university. Some are even organising their offspring’s finances from their laptop at home and booking them doctors’ appointments.Instead of lamenting this trend, West’s university, based in Bristol, has decided to embrace it, giving parents more information and making them “part of the university team”. And with the government leaning on universities to step up their pastoral care, other institutions, including Winchester, Essex, Warwick and Leeds, are taking a similar approach.As of this year, UWE parents get regular newsletters, which flag up key points in the calendar when students might need more emotional support. They have parent web pages telling them where to go for university services, and their own phone line and email address to raise the alarm if they are worried about their children.West acknowledges that starting university can be an overwhelming time for parents as well as students. “But I tell them the last thing you should do is project your anxieties on to your kids. Don’t text them every five minutes. Give them the space to settle in,” he says.He believes the most important thing parents can do is empower their children to talk to them – but not to wade in with opinions, even in the face of alarming behaviour. “If they are taking drugs or drinking, get them to talk to you about it, but don’t be judgmental,” West says. “If you have concerns you can signpost them to us.”There are still clear boundaries, however. “We are clear that this is a different stage, and we are not going to be on the phone updating them all the time,” West says. “If your child doesn’t turn up for a few lectures we won’t be reporting that to you. But if there are signs they are becoming isolated or putting themselves in danger, we will.”Dominique Thompson, a student health consultant who worked as a GP at Bristol University for nearly 20 years, says many parents need guidance on what level of intervention is acceptable and some universities aren’t giving this. “Whatever we feel about parents being involved in university, the fact is that they are, so pushing against the tide is not going to work. Universities need to get ahead and shape that relationship.”Thompson says it is now common for parents to ring to book a GP appointment for their child at university. “You have to question that. It’s done with the best of intentions – they say ‘I’m helping out because he’s busy with lectures’. But this is part of life and they need to learn to handle it alone.”She tells parents that when they drop their children off at university for the first time they mustn’t make the bed. “This isn’t a hotel. And don’t take them to do a food shop. Just leave. They have to learn to do all these things.”Anne West, professor of education policy at the London School of Economics, and author of a new book on “helicopter parents” at university, says support varies widely. The parents of one student accepted that he was living on virtually nothing because he was determined to avoid taking out a student loan, she says. “But there were other parents who were making meals for their children to take back to university, and keeping track of what they were spending their money on.”Alan Percy, head of counselling at Oxford University and chair of the Heads of University Counselling Services group, says parents have been given “a distorting message” that being a good parent is all about removing life’s problems. Instead, he says, they should teach their children practical life skills “and giving them the emotional resilience to face the world without you.“Often students can feel overwhelmed by managing their lives. If their parents have structured everything, at university they are going to fall off a cliff. I would advise parents to explain to young people that there may be times when they feel lonely. Don’t deny that. They should say ‘of course it feels difficult and you miss your friends, but eventually these strangers will be the best friends you’ll have for life’.”Sue Firth, a psychologist based in Cambridgeshire, admits she had her own emotional struggle after dropping off her 18-year-old son and her 20-year-old daughter to start at different universities this autumn.“University is a very big transition for parents. If you’re still part of a couple that helps, but I’m orced and on my own. I spent weeks preparing myself,” she says. “I said to both children: ‘It’s important you understand that it’s not your fault or responsibility if I am lonely. I don’t want you to worry about me.’ They are starting the next chapter of their lives and must be allowed to do that.”She admits she isn’t sure how much she should still be trying to discipline from afar. “I’ve told them both this isn’t you at sixth form now and you can’t just mess around. If they are really struggling I’ll teach them about learning techniques.”Winchester University runs settling-in sessions for parents when they drop their children off for freshers’ week. Dr Nicola Barton, director of student support services, says parents are “allies” in ensuring students are happy. “I will always listen to a parent’s concerns. Some may be over-protective, but I respect that they have known their children for 18 years and if they express concerns, I take notice,” she says.Jacqueline Stevenson, head of research at Sheffield Hallam University’s Institute of Education, studied how much engagement students at her university and Sheffield University had with their parents and was taken aback by how much close contact many still had.“Parents in many cases were vital, because they were giving this overwhelming message of ‘keep going, you’re doing really well, we’ve got your back’. Some students were getting that sort of one-to-one mentoring every single day,” she says.Stevenson says students did not regard this support as “smothering”. She argues that universities need to work harder to spot students who don’t have an emotional cheerleader, who might need someone at the university to step in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f4d296fe0524957a00d6bc0d4af9f893db0dcb0/0_172_5526_3316/master/5526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c4bb3c2ae9e492637e1d1e0bea1047","title":"price beer pink milk why not cost educating child laura mcinerney","story":"The underlying problem with the schools funding crisis is no one has calculated precisely how much schools needMargaret Thatcher famously knew the price of milk. David Cameron had crib sheets showing the cost of beer in Sheffield and London. But does any politician know the price of a primary or secondary education?School budgets are squeezed, with some headteachers so cash-strapped they have taken to closing at Friday lunchtime to help balance the books. Others have protested on the streets of London.Yet the underlying problem is that no one knows how much the schools system needs. In the past five years I’ve sat in umpteen dinners with MPs and philanthropists who loudly proclaim that the public purse simply can’t stand an ever-increasing budget for schools. “It’s just too expensive,” they say, “it must be possible to run schools more efficiently.” What no one says out loud is that to them, efficiently really means more cheaply, which translates into fewer teachers, on lower pay, with fewer resources.When Philip Hammond insulted the entire teaching profession by offering £400m for “little extras” in the budget – a lower amount than was given to potholes – it was fair enough for Labour to complain. But how much more ought he to have provided and what would it buy? The teacher unions are pushing for an injection of at least £2bn, but that figure appears to be cited on the basis of no more than that it would take schools back to 2015 funding levels. Why is that the bar? If more money is needed, a positive case should be made for what it will be spent on and why. “It’s what we did in the past,” is lazy politics.Now, the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who also leads parliament’s education committee, has broken ranks and called on the government to stop the uncertainty and create a 10-year funding plan for education. After all, if the NHS can do it, why can’t schools?Though it may be difficult to work out how much a school place ought to cost, it can’t be impossible, given that the country regularly manages it for higher education. Universities can charge £9,250 per student. The government sees this as the reasonable cost of educating an undergraduate. Should anyone point out that the figure seems high, given that schools educate children for at least six hours every weekday for around half that cost, the universities will quickly point to a plethora of other services they provide – mental health support, libraries, science equipment. Fair enough. But if it’s possible for universities to put a unified price on the delivery of “top quality service”, it must be possible for schools, too.The Labour party should lean in to this problem and resist the temptation always simply to argue that more is better. Imagine if the nebulous promise of their National Education Service became a specific funding commitment of, say, £6,000 for every person, every year, between the age of five and 21. When a student is in school, or college, or university, or with a private training provider, the cash would be used to cover their course. If they don’t use the whole pot – perhaps they have a gap year or go into paid employment – the cash sits in their account, redeemable at a later point. To support lifelong learning, Labour could top up the accounts. A mid-career bonus at 45, perhaps? Another at retirement?The £6,000 is illustrative, of course. The fact remains that we don’t actually know how much a good education costs in Britain. A pint of milk is about 50p. A beer in London costs £5.19. How should we figure out the real cost of a secondary school place? We need a price list. It’s time to get behind Halfon’s call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f4eec89d1f391544c475a0a474626160bd13241/0_1371_4737_2842/master/4737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16d95d1784462b77532e700ead428c8f","title":"nigel slater crab and coriander fettuccine recipe","story":"Creamy pasta with a fishy, herby, succulent sauceBring a large, deep pot of water to the boil and salt it generously.

Specifically, and this happens quite often, when players break out into a run. “It’s because you’ve got that temptation in you,” he says. “Even sometimes when the ball is ahead of you, you want to have a run. It’s really hard not to.” But still, it’s against the spirit of the game, so should runners be sent off? “Er … no! I think they should be given a caution.”Diangana has witnessed a lot of infractions in walking football. He will likely be exposed to many more. The West Ham United youngster, who has won the affection of the London Stadium support since breaking into the first team this season, has taken on a role as ambassador for the club’s participation programme, which includes walking football, a sport played largely by the over-50s.“For me, you get a lot of people who are lonely,” he says, in explaining what led him to get involved in the project. “For them to come out and, even if they’re not playing, just to be around other people, it gives them confidence. It’s nice to be around people.”Diangana says that such a scheme – be it walking football or the legalised running version – would have been very welcome when he was growing up. Now aged 20, he was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but moved to the UK aged four. He grew up in the south London neighbourhood of Woolwich and spent much of his spare time by himself, chasing a ball around.“There’s a park literally 30 seconds’ walk from my house,” he says. “I would kick the ball, do around-the-worlds and just play by myself because I enjoyed it that much. That was always a big part for me when I was younger, how much I enjoyed it. I used to watch the players who entertained me the most, like Ronaldinho. I always used to love having the ball at my feet.”A kid who cultivated his love for the game on his own terms, Diangana has a response to the oft-touted idea that the age of the street footballer is over. “There’s plenty …” he laughs. “There’s so many, honestly.”After nurturing his talent in the park, Diangana joined the West Ham academy at the age of nine and played for the under-18s when he was 14. His breakthrough for the first team came only in late September, against Macclesfield in the third round of the Carabao Cup.The Hammers won 8-0 and Diangana scored twice, two cool finishes after cutting in from the right. His performance earned him a spot on the bench in the Premier League and when Andriy Yarmolenko went down after tearing an achilles tendon against Spurs, it was Diangana who took his place.He has started every game since and has quickly risen in the crowd’s affections, alongside Declan Rice an emblem of a potential new start for the club under Manuel Pellegrini. Earlier this month against Burnley, Diangana shone, a no-look through ball for Felipe Anderson’s first goal the pass everyone was talking about afterwards.Asked what emotions he has been feeling since becoming a Premier League player, Diangana gives a typically measured response. “It’s a difficult one because I feel like I’ve been at the right state of mind for this opportunity,” he says. “So when it has come I’ve felt chilled. I haven’t felt any pressure. I feel like I can go out there and express myself. Even if I make a mistake I don’t beat myself up. I feel like the team are behind me and they told me if you lose it, keep trying, keep trying. So it’s been amazing for me.”With the launch of West Ham’s Players’ Project, in which players of the men’s and women’s teams will take on ambassador roles, West Ham are committing £10m over the next three years to community projects. The club point out that this continues investment over recent years and that part of the money will go towards schemes in all parts of the London borough of Newham, not just in their new home of Stratford.There is no doubt that this is a timely gesture too, politically speaking. Discord over the club’s direction since the move to the London Stadium erupted into full mutiny last March. Now, however, West Ham are presenting a united front once more and this, says Diangana, applies to the squad too.“We’re a close unit,” he says. “You’ve got different languages, but everyone still gets along very well. It’s a very good group. They’ve been nice to me. Sometimes in the changing room they take the mickey, maybe. But to be in and around them is amazing. They do special things with the ball and you’re like: ‘Wow, I’d like to do that.’ I’m always learning every day, so it’s good.”Diangana started for England’s Under-20s on Monday in a 2-0 win over Germany and may yet face a dilemma over which national team to represent. But for now his biggest concern is to keep on learning in the sport that he says “has given me everything”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aa782844d6cc8c0a51c72be43db7fba86a5dc48/82_2799_921_553/master/921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71cd38a0cefae61097adb415f3c63c17","title":"age is no barrier the veteran stars of masters athletics","story":"Masters medal winners from around the world explain how they came to lace up their running – and jumping – shoesThe world of Masters athletics contains all the drama of regular sporting competition, with the additional compelling feature that the athletes are aged from 35 to over 100. But who are these doughty stars of the track, who keep competing long after most of us have stashed our trainers under the spare bed for good?Lesley ChaplinThe bright-eyed track star from Atlanta, Georgia, has enjoyed a flat out astonishing 2018 so far, breaking no fewer than three separate world records in her age category’s 800m indoor, one-mile outdoor and one-mile indoor races. Upliftingly, the 60-year-old credits at least part of her success to husband – and coach – Tom Hintz. “I love being coached by my husband,” she says. “We both share the same love and passion for track.” Surely it sometimes gets a bit stressful, working with a spouse? “He’s very good at wearing two hats.”Events: W60: 400m, 800m, 1,500mBarry FergusonThe 76-year-old hurdler first joined Cambridge Harriers running club back in 1983. He was invited on to the Masters circuit, albeit with only modest success. With his 50th birthday looming, Ferguson decided to take his preparation more seriously – and went on to not only win his next race but set a new British record, which opened the floodgates to a slew of gold medals and records. “I have now travelled all over the world to countries I would not have visited otherwise, for example, Japan, South Korea and Brazil,” Ferguson says.Events: Sprint hurdles – 60m, 80mSue YeomansJust two years after she began training aged 47, Yeomans vaulted her way to victory at the 2002 world championships. So what does she consider her highest accomplishment? “It’s a toss up really – Porto Alegre Brazil 2013 was my most golds in one world championship, in pole vault, high jump, long jump and triple jump. Or there is my comeback world championship gold in pole vault, and a championship record in Perth, Australia six weeks after my mastectomy.” Talk about setting the bar.Events: Pole vault, high jump, long jump, triple jumpMary Trotto“I just completed my tenth decathlon,” says the remarkable 71-year-old athlete from Kihea, Hawaii. “And I still do the steeplechase.” Trotto reckons that beyond the simple joy of competing and winning medals, staying in peak Masters condition improves her quality of life in all sorts of erse ways. “I can play with young nieces and nephews, I can go all day with their asking and visiting without getting tired. I feel strong.”Events: All running events, especially 5km, decathlon, sometimes triathlonPaul OslandA former Olympian who represented his native Canada during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Osland is the current chief executive of Athletics Ontario. He’s looking forward to the Masters World Championships coming to his hometown of Toronto in 2020. “In 2005, I attended my first world championships in Spain. I won the M40 800m race, even though I wasn’t even aware of Masters racing until just a few months prior to the championships.”Events: 800m and 1,500m, occasional 400m, 4x400m and 4x800m relays, some javelin, high jump and pole vaultJoanna HarperHarper, from Portland, Oregon, has been a reliable fixture of the Masters scene since turning 40 in 1997. Until 2004, she competed in the men’s ision, but was forbidden from entering the female ision until three years later despite transitioning her gender. “Those were dark years, when I only entered races on an unofficial basis,” Harper told us. Her data-led work unpicking the stigma of trans women in athletics has seen her make fierce, articulate appearances on Fox News and on the pages of the Washington Post.Events: Distance running, 1,500m to marathonMoira WestWest’s journey to the Masters began more than two decades ago. “Aged 46, I put on some trainers and went for a jog. A lady I met while out running said I could join her for company and when I could run 2 miles she’d take me to the local Overton Harriers club. So it started – 5k became 10k and I enjoyed road races and cross-country. Aged 50, a teammate suggested I would be better suited to sprinting. I entered the Cardiff indoor Masters championships and got a silver medal in the 200m, and in 2012 was awarded my first world championship medal.”Events: 60m, 100m, 200m and 400mJohn WaskoAs a resident of American Samoa in the South Pacific, Wasko faces a daunting commute whenever he wants to compete at the Masters. But he still trains just as hard. “Personal satisfaction isn’t always about being at a big meet,” the 74-year-old says. “It’s knowing you’re competitive with other athletes. My times are up there with the top runners in the world.” He’s evangelical about track running. “It’s not like soccer where there’s overtime, a second chance. When the gun goes off you have to excel, even if nobody is in the other lane.”Events: 100m, 200m, 400m"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic. There are train stations at Crosskeys, Hengoed and Quakers Yard.Pit stopsLord Nelson Inn, Commercial St, Nelson, Treharris. Cafe on the Rock, the Old Drift Mine, Trelewis, Treharris.Distance: 10.6 miles Start: Aberdeen station End: DrumoakTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours, at a leisurely paceThe Deeside Way in its entirety follows a former railway line from Aberdeen to Ballater, of which this is a 10-mile, largely traffic-free section. Start at the Polmuir Road entrance of Aberdeen’s Duthie park, behind the Winter Gardens. One of the largest indoor gardens in Europe, it is well worth a visit, with rare plants from around the world, and the tantalising “corridor of perfumes”.Follow the leafy path past homes and parkland, and under tree canopies towards Peterculter. You’ll join a quiet country road at Coalford keep on the path until you reach an access road leading to Drumoak. There are three former stations en route, as well as the Peterculter Heritage Centre and, a short distance from the Deeside Way at Drumoak, the 13th-century Drum Castle.

The popular route, in the heart of the Peak District, is steeped in geological, industrial and rail heritage. There are six rail tunnels, four of which are around 400-metres long and lit during the day, as well as excellent views from Monsal, Headstone and Miller’s viaducts. From Blackwell Mill, just south of Buxton, head east through enchanting Chee Dale, in the Upper Wye valley. The lime kilns at Millers Dale station are imposing, fortress-like structures, cut into the rock face.Pit stop Hassop Station Cafe is in an old station building on the trail, complete with sun terrace.

Starting at Cowes, it traces the Medina River to Blackwater, before wending through peaceful countryside, following the River Yar to Sandown. En route are Osborne House (above left), Queen Victoria and Albert’s former holiday home, Cowes Maritime Museum, the Museum of Island History in Newport, Carisbrooke Castle and Dinosaur Isle, in Sandown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae32aa9665c8bb81e78575c511a20b24227276c/407_46_2136_1282/master/2136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a9783d5bd14517a526fb0038048d52","title":"the ebike has landed six models to get you on the road","story":"The age of the ebike has arrived, helping to make a pedal to work or the shops easier than ever. From the high-end to the competitively priced, here are six electric bikes to spark your imaginationSo you like the idea of cycling but you’re put off by thinking it could be too intense? Or maybe you’d be fine with getting on a bike if it wasn’t for that merciless hill nearby.Electric bikes, or ebikes, are a great solution for non-cyclists. You can enjoy exercise as you pedal on the flat, but the onboard battery can bolster your effort, making hills manageable – and quicker – without reducing you to a puddle of sweat. That extra oomph also means you can breeze away from traffic lights with minimal exertion.So what sort of ebike would you like? One that looks noticeably different from regular rides, or one that blends in, so nobody spots your unfair advantage? Before you go making that kind of decision, it’s worth noting that an ebike attracts a price premium for the extra electronics. You’ll also have to remember to charge the battery fairly regularly – after all, this adds around 6kg to the bike’s weight, so if you let it go flat, you’ll need to pedal harder on your suddenly heavy ride.Gocycle GSFrom £2,499 from gocycleThe British-designed Gocycle has a magnesium frame, which makes it both great-looking and tremendously light it’s a slick, assured ride. Weighing in at around 16kg, the GS is partly foldable for easier carrying, although it’s nowhere near as fast to open and close as the Brompton (see below). The docking station for faster recharging, available separately, reduces recharge time from seven hours to less than four, providing a range of between 40 and 50 miles, after which it’s just down to you to do the pedalling. This is Gocycle’s fourth ebike, and its most accomplished – with an exceptional attention to detail in the design. This includes what Gocycle calls a Cleandrive, which means the chain and oil are in an enclosed housing to keep your jeans oil-free.Gtech eBike SportFrom £995.99 from gtechBritish manufacturer Gtech makes ebikes in two styles: Sport and City. The Sport has a 51cm frame with crossbar, while the City has a 43cm step-through frame. In either case, the bike needs to be assembled when it arrives. This is not arduous, and online videos can guide you through this, as well as how to operate the battery. It’s not as powerful as some bikes here, but more than competent. And it’s very well-priced – under £1,000 including delivery. It also comes with a 14-day trial, so you can return it if you don’t get on with it. But it is an appealing, fun ride that offers plenty of electric support. The battery range is quoted at 30 miles, so you need to charge it more frequently than most, but it also charges faster than most other ebikes, taking three hours against the typical five or more.Brompton ElectricFrom £2,595 from bromptonThe familiar Brompton folding bike now has an electric version, which looks almost identical to other bikes in the range. The removable battery sits in a bag in front of the handlebars, connecting to the small but powerful motor, which sits on the front wheel. You can customise the handlebar shape and the gearing, and the Brompton is just a little heavier than the Gocycle GS. The ride and feel of the Brompton is very similar to a non-powered model nippy and precise, in other words. And the fold, which is quick and effective, is second to none. It’s one of the things that makes the brand so deservedly successful, and the 40cm wheels help the folded bike feel particularly compact. The other benefit of a Brompton, electric or otherwise, is that you can take it indoors with you, reducing the chances of it being stolen.Pinnacle Lithium Ion 2018£2,000 from evanscyclesThe Lithium Ion – from Pinnacle, Evans Cycles’ in-house brand – is a very comfortable ride, equally at home on country roads or urban streets. The detachable battery sits on the frame and is hard to miss. But because it’s removable you only need to charge that rather than carrying the whole bike up a flight of stairs, say. Although it’s visible, the battery is well placed to balance the bike, and you don’t feel it as you’re riding. It includes disc brakes that are responsive and effective on even steep downhills or in damp weather. Battery range is about 60 miles, a touch more than some here. But if you keep it in the high-assistance mode, it’ll be much less than that, perhaps half.Volt Pulse£1,499 from voltbikesVolt specialises in electric bikes, and the strikingly designed Pulse is one of its standout models. It comes with a choice of frame sizes and battery capacities, so you can ride for up to 60 or up to 80 miles, as you please. Pedal assistance is very smooth – so much so that you may fool yourself into thinking you’re doing all the work. Bikes, ebikes included, are mostly priced according to the quality of components on board and the parts here, including disc brakes, are excellent, meaning less adjustment and maintenance. The battery can be detached when you need to charge it, although you need to remove the seat post to do so.Pendleton Somerby Electric£850 from halfordsOlympic gold-medal winner Victoria Pendleton is behind this Halfords range of bikes, all of which are competitively priced and well built. The electric model comes in a step-through frame in two sizes, 43cm and 48cm. The battery sits on the back wheel, with a luggage rack helpfully placed on top. If you don’t look too closely, it absolutely looks like a regular, classically styled bike. Mudguards come as standard. It’s heavier than some here, although the battery power will help alleviate the effect of that. Although it’s not the nippiest bike around, it suits a gentle commute or weekend ramble. The white and navy frame won’t be to everyone’s taste, but it’s also available in a more discreet midnight black (with rose gold accents)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dd11e7b1b7463c2b603bc491b63d881667aa44a/171_113_2379_1428/master/2379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5054ccf5f24480f05ef341d5cb3921d","title":"no time for the gym then try hiit the workout you can do anywhere","story":"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be done in a matter of minutes and delivers fitness in dense, bite-size chunks of exercise throughout the day. No wonder the fitness world loves itIf you have an injury or health condition, consult your doctor before doing these exercisesIt doesn’t take much time to improve your health. HIIT has become a staple in the fitness world and for good reason: it’s the time-efficient, super-effective way to get fitter that’s backed by science.But it doesn’t always have to mean donning your lycra – in fact, research shows that as little as a minute of HIIT can benefit the body. The workouts below take two minutes each, one for each hour of your working day. They target every muscle group in the body, require no equipment and can be done in very little space.The benefits? You’ll boost your circulation and energy levels every hour, so no more wanting to sleep face down on your keyboard it will increase your cardio fitness, muscle strength and core stability, and you’ll continue to burn calories even after you’re back at your desk!Before doing each workout, warm up by gently jogging on the spot for 30 seconds and then standing and raising one knee at a time in front of you – 10 on each leg. Work as hard as you can for the 20-second bursts of exercise. At the end of the workout, pace around for 30 seconds to cool down and stretch out any muscles that feel tight.Each workout follows the same pattern: do the first three exercises for 20 seconds each, with 10 seconds of rest in between each one. Do the fourth exercise for 30 seconds:Plank Lie on your front, hands beneath your shoulders, elbows pointing back. Tuck your toes under and push yourself up until your arms are straight, pulling your navel up towards your spine so you feel the core stability muscles around your middle engage. Keep looking at the floor and make sure your bottom is neither sagging towards the floor nor pushing up towards the ceiling.Press-ups From a plank position, bend your elbows to lower yourself towards the floor. Letting your elbows flare out to the side works the chest harder keeping them nearer your sides focuses more on the triceps. A full-press up is touching your nose almost to the ground, but you may not get that far to start with. The most important thing is to keep a straight line from your knees, to hips, to head. Balance on your knees rather than your feet to make it easier if needed.Jumping jacksStand with feet together and hands by your sides. Simultaneously, jump your feet out sideways and swing your arms out to the side and up until your fingertips meet above your head. Jump back to starting position.Bottom kicksJog on the spot, flicking your heels up to kick your bottom.High kneesJog on the spot while bringing your knees up high in front of you. Use your arms to really drive the movement and go as fast as you can. If this is too vigorous for you, do the same action but as though you’re walking rather than running.Mountain climbersFrom a plank position, lift your right foot off the floor and drive the knee towards your chest. Place the foot back and repeat with your left knee. Don’t stick your bottom high in the air and keep a rapid flow.Shadow boxStand with feet hip-width apart and bring fists up into a boxing position. Punch upwards with the right hand then the left, then punch across your body with your right hand then left, allowing your body to rotate towards the direction of the punch and heel to come off the floor.Bear crawlKneel on all fours, hands directly under your shoulders, knees under your hips. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees to hover a few inches above the ground. Now crawl forwards – right arm at same time as left leg and vice versa – for six paces, then crawl backwards for six. Keep your abdominals engaged and back as flat as possible (imagine you’re balancing something on it).Reverse lungesStand with feet hip-width apart. Step back with your left foot, lowering the front knee to a right angle or deeper. Focus on using the glute in your right buttock to power back up to standing. Repeat with the right leg.Sumo squatsStand with feet wide apart, toes turned slightly out (about 45-degree angle), hands clasped in front of your chest. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees in the direction of your toes (but don’t go beyond them) to lower yourself until your knees are as near to 90 degrees as possible. Keep your weight in your heels. Come back to standing.Squats or jump squatsStand with feet just wider than hip-width apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on opposite shoulders. Keeping your torso upright and chest facing forward, bend your knees and stick your bottom out, spread your weight through your heels and ensure that your knees don’t stick out beyond the end of your toes. For a full squat, you’re aiming to lower your bottom to knee height while keeping your chest facing forward, but go as far as is comfortable. Return to standing. To make squats harder, add in a little jump at the top of the move.Bicycle crunchesLie on your back with feet flat on the floor, hands touching your ears, elbows out to the side. Simultaneously, lift your feet and head off the floor and begin to slowly move your legs in a pedalling motion. As your right knee comes towards you, bring your left elbow towards it and vice versa with the left knee and right elbow. Keep your torso still by engaging your core stability muscles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d649b3dbffc667f90619c54f8ddbeac2a41003c6/1_0_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde0dd5856101205d41508bd23bee475","title":"pet psychics telepathy","story":"The key to telepathy with your furry friend: ‘You just have to trust your imagination’ Shira Plotzker did not set out to become a pet psychic. It just sort of happened. She was sitting at home in Nyack, New York, watching the animal communicator Sonya Fitzpatrick on TV.Suddenly, the dog that was talking to Fitzpatrick started talking to her. “He told me he thought it was a lot of fun to be on TV! And he was very proud of himself for doing so good.”Realizing she had abruptly developed the ability to communicate with animals, Plotzker expanded her existing psychic business to cater to pets.Fifteen or so years later, business is booming, Plotzker tells me. Dogs and cats make up the bulk of her clientele, but she’s spoken to snakes, horses, wolves and the elephants at Tampa zoo. She was also invited to speak to some police dogs, but, she says, the police aren’t allowed to endorse her.She charges $100 for a half-hour session and has no shortage of customers. People seek her help to find lost animals, fix behavioural problems, diagnose illnesses, and communicate with pets who have passed away. (Yes, she also speaks to dead animals.)You might think very few people are blessed with supernatural interspecies communication abilities, but those looking for an animal communicator are spoiled for choice. These services typically don’t come cheap, however. Laura Stinchfield, a California-based pet psychic, charges $150 for a 30-minute phone session – and $200 if it’s an “emergency session”. Lisa Greene, in Houston, charges $260 an hour for an in-home reading. Hilary Renaissance, a psychic who specializes in locating lost pets, charges $115 for help finding your furry friend.Reader, I am no clairvoyant. However, I think I can sense what you are thinking. You are thinking: nonsense. Nobody can psychically communicate with animals.Marjie Alonso, executive director of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC), would tend to agree. “The IAABC is an evidence-based organization promoting best practices in animal behavior and training. While we understand that belief-based practices inspire passion and conviction in some people, there is no scientifically verified evidence that these methods are based on anything more than faith.”Further, Alonso notes, pet psychics may seem harmless, but “belief-based practices can lead clients and practitioners to see change and improvement where there is none, potentially causing harm to the animal.”Dr Aleda Cheng, a New Jersey-based veterinarian, agrees that you shouldn’t substitute spirituality for science. However, she says she’s seen enough evidence to convince her that the idea of pet psychics shouldn’t be dismissed outright.There have been several occasions, says Cheng, when the animal communicator’s advice has proved eerily accurate. For example, “I had a cat who was having a breathing problem and the owner spoke to an animal communicator, who said the cat needed acupuncture.” The animal communicator pointed out the areas where the cat needed acupuncture on a chart, and it turned out that targeting those areas helped. Cheng says she hadn’t thought about focusing on those areas before because they weren’t related to asthma.“Animals are very empathetic and can pick up on their owners’ feelings,” Cheng believes – so, if consulting a pet psychic helps calm the pet’s owner down, the animal may feel more relaxed and be more receptive to treatment. Nevertheless, Cheng thinks there may be something more than a placebo effect at work. “When I first started vet school everyone thought acupuncture was voodoo medicine now it’s very accepted by mainstream veterinarians. I think in the future we might find there is something to psychic medication.”Cheng isn’t the only person to have gone from cynic to believer. Janis Kowalski, who runs a decluttering business, says she came across Shira Plotzker by chance 10 years ago, at a group session Plotzker was running in a local library. “Because I wasn’t registered in the session – I just joined on a whim – she didn’t know my name or anything about me,” Kowalski says. She was “shocked”, she explains, at how accurate Plotzker’s reading was. “We’d just got a new dog and she told me “your new dog loves going in the pool with your son but when your husband came home with a sprinkler he didn’t like that – he only likes the pool.”Lo and behold, not a word of that was false.In the interests of, erm, science, I asked Plotzker to have a chat with my own dog, Rascal. I didn’t need to hand my phone over to Rascal for the chat to take place Plotzker assured me she could channel his thoughts without the help of T-Mobile. All she needed to get started was his name. Rascal, it turned out, was in a very talkative mood, but didn’t have anything particularly insightful to tell me.“He says he knows you love him,” Plotzker announced. “He says you think he’s very handsome. He says you have lots of pictures of him on the computer.”Just as I had started aggressively rolling my eyes, however, Plotzker surprised me with a rather more specific message. “Rascal wants to know when the new bed is coming,” she said. I had just bought a new bed, and it was arriving the next day. (She promptly lost some of my newly won confidence, however, when she went on to say Rascal is very fond of the color blue “because blue is for boys” – clearly I would never raise a dog to have such gender-normative views.)Plotzker’s psychic abilities may have been bestowed upon her by higher powers, but those looking to chat with their own pets will be glad to hear that these supernatural abilities can, to some extent, be learned. This is according to Sonya Fitzpatrick, the woman who had inspired Plotzker so many years ago, and who is described (admittedly by herself) “as the most experienced and trusted animal communicator in the world”.Speaking over the phone, Fitzpatrick told me that we’re actually talking to our pets all the time. We’re all “transmitting like radios” and communicating to our animals in ways of which we aren’t fully aware. If you want to tap into this subconscious communication channel, Fitzpatrick says you have to start by being very quiet.Don’t let this subtlety stop you from chatting to your dog. Psychic communication, it would seem, is a little like poetry: it requires a willing suspension of disbelief. Ultimately, the secret to communicating psychically with your animal, Fitzpatrick stresses, is not getting too hung up on reason. “You just have to trust your imagination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98de436271b5547dd8eb1f469994b3b44252fb35/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=957036c6380285443b86550efc2e2be4","title":"eccentric women why they are more important than ever in our oppressive era","story":"From Janelle Monáe to Tilda Swinton, unconventional women are having a moment. In an age threatened by groupthink and strongman politics, they provide an essential antidoteCrazy. Feisty. Bolshy. Bossy. Hysterical. Sassy. Shrill. Spinster. Cat woman. Hag. Cougar. Frigid. Slut. Bitch. The English language has no end of words to describe women who don’t behave the way they are supposed to. They are all derogatory and almost none of them have a male equivalent. The most complimentary thing you can hope to be called if you are a woman who doesn’t conform to societal expectations is the E-word: eccentric.While the idea of eccentricity is nebulous, it is an important barometer of society and women’s place within it. “The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour and moral courage it contained,” wrote John Stuart Mill in 1859. If that is the case, then I think we should be incredibly excited by the loud and proud display of feminist vigour running through popular culture. From Janelle Monáe rocking very unsubtle vagina trousers in the music video for her song Pynk to Marina Abramović’s provocative performance art, and TV shows such as Killing Eve and Sally4Ever that revel in weird women, female eccentricity is having a moment.Dr David Weeks, a neuropsychologist at the Royal Edinburgh hospital and the author of Eccentrics: A Study of Sanity and Strangeness, agrees. “We are seeing more female nonconformists, and most eccentric women come from that group. There are more eccentric women nowadays, although they were not as well documented over the period from about 1580 to 1800 in the UK.”The emergence of more female eccentrics is a sign of how much feminists have achieved. Women, Weeks says, now have more opportunities to “exercise their creativity, independent-mindedness and their feminist, anti-sexist rights.”To be labelled as eccentric rather than crazy used to be a privilege only a great deal of money could buy. In the past, eccentric women tended to be aristocrats. Being upper class gave one more licence to stray from social norms. As Edith Sitwell, one of history’s most famous female eccentrics, noted: “The genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd.” If you were posh enough, you could get away with anything.Sitwell came from an incredibly wealthy and famously odd family. Her father, Sir George Sitwell, invented a tiny pistol for shooting wasps and a musical toothbrush. When not shooting wasps, he wrote a number of unusual – and unpublished – books, including A Short History of the Fork and Acorns as an Article of Medieval Diet. Then there was her maternal grandfather, the Earl of Londesborough, who died after contracting a disease from a parrot. Some of her relations were reportedly fond of hiding live lobsters between the sheets as a prank. Her mother, Ida Sitwell, was an alcoholic who spent a few months in Holloway prison for fraud. It would have been remarkable, with all that going on, if Sitwell had ended up in any way conventional.This is particularly true considering her appearance, which was striking. She was 6ft tall with a magnificently beak-like nose and dressed in unusual clothes. The author Elizabeth Bowen described her as looking like a “high altar on the move”. Her poetry was similarly idiosyncratic, as was her manner of performing it: she has been described as the world’s first white rapper and performed the poems of her series Façade through a large megaphone behind a curtain. There is more than an echo of Sitwell’s defiance of gender and genre norms in many of today’s eccentric women – particularly when it comes to Tilda Swinton, who happens to be Sitwell’s cousin. (Swinton paid her respects to her forebear in a photoshoot for W magazine this month when she dressed up as Sitwell.)But Sitwell is not the most eccentric female aristocrat to have graced history. In fact, in many ways, she led a conservative life compared with the extraordinary Hester Stanhope. Born in 1776, Lady Stanhope spent her early adulthood managing the household of her uncle, William Pitt the Younger, who was then serving as prime minister. In her early 30s, after her uncle’s death and a love affair gone wrong, she reinvented herself as an archaeologist and explorer and headed off in pursuit of adventure in the Middle East.Like Sitwell, Stanhope was known for her unusual fashion she was shipwrecked during her travels and lost her English wardrobe, so she started dressing like a Turkish man. She even shaved her hair and wore a cashmere turban. Her clothing, along with her confidence, meant that no one knew what to make of her. “She was neither a man nor woman, but a being apart,” said her biographer, Joan Haslip. She was treated as a being apart, too, getting unique privileges and access. She became the first European woman to enter Palmyra in Syria and earned the nickname the Queen of the Desert.While, historically speaking, being an English aristocrat helped ensure you were put in the eccentric box rather than a mental asylum, it has never been a mandatory requirement for attaining eccentric status. What is most important is defying categorisation being impossible to pin down. That has traditionally been much harder for women than for men, with society having invented so many labels for women so many convenient ways to reduce them to types rather than appreciate them as iniduals so many ways to cast off female nonconformity as mad or bad rather than interesting.One woman who defied categorisation without the help of any blue blood was Vivian Maier, a US nanny and street photographer who died in 2009. Maier took more than 100,000 photographs during her lifetime but her work was largely a secret. Her prodigious output came to light by chance in 2007, when a young estate agent called John Maloof bought a box of negatives at auction, hoping it would contain pictures of his Chicago neighbourhood. In fact, it contained work that is now considered to be among the finest street photography of the 20th century. Maloof became obsessed with finding out more about their unlikely creator.What makes Maier so intriguing is the contradictions she embodies: career nanny street photographer proudly independent mysteriously private. She resists any easy attempt at categorisation. There is no easy way to bundle up and explain her you must approach her as an inidual.This insistence on unapologetic iniduality is what makes modern eccentrics such a powerful force for social change, particularly at a time when authoritarianism and groupthink threatens to take over the world. The likes of the Icelandic musician Björk, Swinton, Abramović and Monáe do not fit comfortably into a particular era or genre, nor within the conventional confines of gender. They are purely themselves and they are unapologetic about it. And that is the most revolutionary thing a woman can ever be.“I’m always left of centre and that’s right where I belong,” Monáe sings on I Like That, a single on her latest album, Dirty Computer. “Told the whole world  I’m the venom and the antidote  Take a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

Not yet? Many people never do. One in three adults in the UK have no private pension, and will rely on the state pension in old age. Even those who do start saving usually only get round to it in their 40s and 50s, upping their pension contributions in the hope of retiring in their 60s. But there is a new breed of supersavers who have no intention of waiting that long. They intend to quit before the age of 40 and live a free life.The Financial Independence, Retire Early (Fire) movement originated in the US, but has spread to the UK, attracting twenty- and thirtysomethings who do not intend to spend 40 years strapped to the corporate machine. Instead, they are practising a combination of extreme saving and rigorous investing to try to build up the “stash” you need – commonly seen as 25 times your annual expenditure – to quit, or, as these millennials put it, to “get Fired”.Hall says it’s a question of being organised, not miserly. “I wouldn’t want to come across as some tight old git who doesn’t socialise,” he insists. He says the choices he makes are simply rational, and mentions using the free coffee machine in his office rather than stopping off for an expensive one at the shop at the entrance. “You would not believe how many people every single day get the coffee downstairs, paying £2.50 or £3. Do that every day for a year and it adds up to quite a significant number. Going out for lunch is another big thing.” Make your own sandwiches, he suggests.He is putting his money into a lifetime Isa and “passive” tracker funds, which follow the stock market and charge low fees because they are not actively managed. He intends to buy a property in Manchester, rent it out and perhaps work abroad. “I enjoy my job for now, but things can change, and when I’m 30 or 35 I’d like to have the option of thinking: ‘Do you know what? Stuff it. I’m going to go and do something else.’ The goal is not retirement, but freedom to do whatever I want to do.”Dave Hamilton, who is 41 and lives in south London, retired five years ago after spending 15 years working in data analytics. “I was always convinced there was more to life and more fun to be had in the world of nonwork,” he says. He has paid off his mortgage and, after spending the final seven years of his working life saving £35,000 of his £75,000 salary, has accumulated a pot of £500,000. Properly invested, he says, this should keep him going for the rest of his life. “I have very simple tastes. I don’t buy flashy clothes, cars, computers. My aim wasn’t to retire rich, but to retire with a realistic understanding of what I would need for my living standards to continue.”He says his family and friends thought he was mad. “‘Why are you doing this?’ they said. ‘You’ve got a good job. You’ll get bored. I reckon you’ll be back in a year.’ I didn’t know what I was going to do, I just knew that the world was full of things I wanted to see and do, and even if I chose to watch daytime TV all week, at least I didn’t have to go into the office at someone else’s beck and call. Now, I have been retired for more than five years. In that time, I’ve travelled a lot, got married, had a child, learned Italian, taken up painting and built a house. I play a lot of tennis and rarely switch on the telly. I spend much less money now because the things I enjoy don’t cost that much.”Emily (she prefers not to reveal her surname), who is 44 and earns £90,000 a year at a scientific company, is another committed Fire follower. She says she will work at most for another 10 years. That would make her a late retiree by Fire standards, but she wants to be sure she will never have to do paid work again.She admits to getting carried away now and again, and imposing “shopping bans” where she does not buy anything except food. “You can get really obsessed about not spending any money, and that’s not good for you either,” she says. “The whole point about saving a huge pot of cash is not having to stress about money, so overstressing about saving that pot of cash isn’t doing you any good. You need to find that sweet spot between saving a decent amount and still living a life.”Mr Money Mustache, AKA Pete Adeney, is the standard-bearer for Fire. A 44-year-old Canadian living in Colorado, he worked for 10 years before packing it all in just after he turned 30. He describes himself as a “mild-mannered retired computer engineer”. “I realised in my mid-20s that I was perfectly content to ride my bike to work and cook my own dinner,” he says. “So I had no interest in spending the relatively high salary that even an average income earner, let alone an engineer, makes here in the US. But I knew that money was a useful thing, so I wanted to put it to good use. I decided that buying my own freedom was probably the best use of that money.”He ided his life into two phases – the working, earning, saving part and the living, creating, parenting part. “As a young engineer, I remember seeing what a challenge my older colleagues faced with having to ide their attention between their careers and their kids,” he says. “It seemed like they were not able to give their full efforts to either endeavour. So, I decided to focus purely on my work for that period of my life, and then focus on being a dad for the 18 years thereafter. I’m currently on year 13 of the second project.” He and his wife orced recently, but he says they are “still very close co-parents”.Through his widely read blog, Adeney has become the philosopher king of the movement, though he admits his ideas were anticipated by earlier practitioners such as Jacob Lund Fisker in his blog Early Retirement Extreme. Adeney calls his version of Fire “Mustachianism”, and says he started his blog in 2011 “out of a sense of exasperation”. “Already six years into retirement at that point, I was amazed that peers with similarly high incomes were not only still stuck working, but were still living almost paycheck to paycheck,” he says. His main tenet is that “happiness is not very expensive” – it is only retail companies and ad agencies that try to persuade you it is.He tells his adherents, no matter how much they are earning, that they should aim to save and invest half their income. “At this level, your mandatory work career is about 17 years,” he says. “Just for comparison, saving three-quarters puts you at about eight years. It’s not really about early retirement it’s about starting to live the best life you can right now, with more purpose and less stress. My blog has never really been about money it is about encouraging humans to live happier and more rational lives.”Barney Whiter, AKA the Escape Artist, is the best-known UK-based disciple of Mustachianism. Now 48, he retired five years ago after a 20-year career in corporate finance. On his blog, he says he paid off his mortgage when he was 32, built up an investment portfolio and quit his job at the age of 43.I tell Whiter Mustachianism sometimes sounds like a cult, and to my surprise he agrees. “You’ve got this charismatic leader and these very loyal followers,” he admits. But, he says, those followers are very erse. “The people who come to the meet-ups are anything but clones. What they have in common is a desire not to be ripped off by ‘the Man’. They don’t subscribe to consumerism.”Whiter says the Fire movement will get a boost early next year with the release of Travis Shakespeare’s documentary Playing With Fire, which charts the rise of the movement and looks at one couple’s efforts to achieve financial independence. Shakespeare has skin in the game, he says, because he has been practising Fire for the past decade, having previously been “financially illiterate” and still in the red when he turned 40. Discovering Fisker’s and Adeney’s writings (and inheriting some money from his father) saved him. “I told myself: ‘I have a chance now to not end up eating cat food in my old age.’”Eight years on, he is financially independent, and feels this has allowed his career as a producer and director to flourish. “I began to make bolder choices at work because I knew that if I ‘failed’, I had a reliable backup plan,” he says.Shakespeare argues that people who free themselves from what he calls “obligatory work” will be a force for good because many of them will use their creativity for socially useful ends, and that they have the capacity to become standard-bearers for anti-consumerism. He traces the idea of a fulfilled, liberated life back to 19th-century writer Henry David Thoreau and his paean to nature, Walden. The Fire movement even has its own version of Thoreau in Elizabeth Willard Thames, AKA Mrs Frugalwoods, who has written a book about opting out of urban life and buying 26 hectares (66 acres) of woodland in rural Vermont, on which she lives with her husband and two daughters. Like Adeney, she hymns the simple, outdoor life unencumbered by excess – a rival American dream to the consumerist one. Both dreams require money – buying 66 acres of rural Vermont complete with house and barn cost the Frugalwoods $389,000.Does Fire have anything to offer people on lower incomes? Most of the practitioners in the UK who I speak to are sceptical. It is possible to see the whole movement as malign (Whiter wonders whether I am preparing a “hatchet job”), with middle-class people using rising property prices and a buoyant stock market to become a new leisured aristocracy.I don’t want to do a hatchet job – I can see that financial independence is attractive, and that an anticonsumerism philosophy, even if more libertarian than socially driven, can be positive. But you can’t ignore what one Fire aspirant called the movement’s “dirty little secret”: saving on a low income is hell. What does Fire offer those who are on low-paying or zero hours contracts, can’t escape high rent or childcare costs, and will be lucky to get out of poverty and enjoy leisure on a reasonable income at 70, let alone 40?“Your question is one that I have also grappled with,” Shakespeare says. “Obviously Fire is not a path for the working poor, and I don’t think anyone is claiming it ever could be. However, once a person earns more than she needs for basic expenses, she is in a position to grow wealth and pursue a greater sense of freedom and agency over her life.” Shakespeare suggests adopting an incremental approach – everyone who has something left over from spending on essentials should save what they can to buy some degree of freedom. “I personally think of Fire less in terms of polarity – ie, you’re either financially independent or not – and more in terms of stages,” he says. “For example, if someone is able to save a month’s salary, he is protected from events like a water heater going out or a car breakdown. If he saves six months, his ability to comfortably manoeuvre, say, a job change is much more powerful. A year’s savings gives a person the ability to take a year off, try to start a business, go back to school, etc. All these markers grant the inidual greater power over, for lack of a better phrase, wage slavery. If you’ve got three years of wages in the bank you can make even bolder decisions.”“My favourite debate!” says Whiter. “The tools and techniques of Fire are needed more by low-income people – to avoid them being fucked over by the system.” In a blogpost entitled Financial Independence Is for Everyone, he tackles the subject head on: “If you’re not a high earner, it’s even more important not to piss your money away on ridiculous spending. Living paycheck to paycheck leaves people at the bottom of society prone to disaster. They, more than anyone, need the techniques of financial independence to build a safety net and gain options to improve their life.”In another post last month, Whiter featured his friend Ken Okoroafor, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria at the age of 14, speaking poor English, lived in a bedsit and encountered daily racism. Twenty years later, he too is financially independent. If Okoroafor could do it, suggested Whiter, anyone could. But he went on to make a more general point – that everyone, whatever their circumstances, can do something to improve their situation. “Sometimes, people tell me that not everyone can get to financial independence,” he writes. “I file that information under ‘N’ for ‘No shit, Sherlock’. Not everyone can run a marathon in three hours either. But more people would be able to run five or 10 miles if they put down the doughnuts and went for a run.”Greg had a brain haemorrhage last year – which was the trigger to put their plan into action. The Owens were keen on boating and, when Greg recovered, they sold their house in Bradford and bought a 55ft narrowboat. They now cruise the canals of Yorkshire, moving on every couple of weeks to avoid mooring fees. They have a budget of about £750 a month, which they admit is tight, but say that having to forgo a few luxuries is worth it in exchange for the freedom.I ask them what their children think of their nomadic lifestyle. “They are somewhere between amused and despairing,” says Frankie, “but I think they are secretly quite pleased. They understand that we want to do something for us and that we worked hard for a long time.” Greg, who used to be a copywriter, says having their first child at 19 meant they were never “young and free”, so they have chosen freedom now. A perfect example of living your life backwards, though they accept that in a couple of decades, when they take their occupational and state pensions, they may come back on to dry land and invest in a flat. Until then, they just hope to stay afloat.Financial advisers, who may feel threatened by the Fire community’s capacity for independent action, are largely dismissive of its approach. “People need to realise that we can’t have our cake and eat it,” Martin Stewart, director of the financial advice firm London Money, told the Daily  in September. “Sure, save half your salary, eat the roadkill, bin-dip, raid the charity shops, recycle everything, just stay in and actually read the T\u0026ampCs of things rather than waste money going out. From this you will create lots of savings, but sadly very few memories.”“I hate it,” the US personal finance guru Suze Orman said last month when asked about Fire on the Afford Anything podcast. “As you get older, things happen. You’re hit by a car, you fall down on the ice, you get sick, you get cancer. Things happen, and if you don’t have a significant amount of money, what are you going to do? You are going to burn up alive.” By significant amount of money she didn’t mean $250,000 (£195,000) or even a million. “Two million is nothing,” she said. “It’s nothing. It’s pennies in today’s world.” She thought $10m might just about do it.“This thinking is completely backwards,” Adeney countered in a blogpost. “Money will not cure your fear, as the megamillionaire Suze proves so clearly. If you are afraid of what might happen in the future, you have a mental problem rather than a financial problem.”He ended his counterblast with what sounded like a manifesto. Fire, he said, is “a system of living your best life in all ways rather than just the financial, based on our best understanding of human nature, with a bit of math and science behind it … It’s always open for modification or improvement, but like science itself, there’s nothing for a rational person to hate. Who hates learning? The reason it has spread to millions of people is that it works. People try it, they like the results, so they share it with their friends, and the cycle repeats. There’s no stopping an idea or a movement like that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb748d4e17969f65d2328d07e36d00b7b871a39/1018_115_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016e937bf0a73a025c02caf4c6fbc03d","title":"archie shepp review sax barbican london hammond organ amina claudine myers","story":"Barbican, London The veteran sax player celebrates the art song with yelps, screeches and a fine quintet showcasing vocalist Amina Claudine Myers at the HammondArchie Shepp is now 81, the kind of age at which jazz musicians receive standing ovations simply for being alive and staggering on to the stage. But he still wants to put on a show, and tonight his aim is to celebrate what he calls the “art song”. It’s a rather nebulous definition that encompasses spiritual jazz and civil rights anthems – everything from John Coltrane’s Wise One to numbers from Shepp’s incendiary 1972 albums Attica Blues and The Cry of My People – making this a greatest hits set.Some clarity and precision is now missing, but Shepp’s solos are as garrulous as ever. There’s the sweet, leisurely, breathy tone at the lower end of the tenor sax that recalls Ben Webster, along with frequent lurches into clownish, vibrato-heavy yelps and screeches at the upper register (what Philip Larkin dismissed as “these death-to-all-white-men wails”). Much of the heavy lifting is done by a fine quintet – most based in Paris, where Shepp has lived for decades. There are also some muscular harmonies from the eight-strong choir, which features Carleen Anderson (hitting outrageous high notes) and Cleveland Watkiss (who also fronted Simon Purcell’s excellent Red Circle in the support slot).But the real star is gospel organist and singer Amina Claudine Myers, who really takes this material to church, her Hammond interlocking with pianist Pierre François Blanchard, her voice hollering above Shepp’s ecstatic wails. The “new wave” that Shepp helped to pioneer in the 1960s was often hindered by a certain arid spikiness, but tonight’s set is soul and skronk in perfect harmony, something that Shepp has been grasping at for more than half a century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf306486891a75d1227c0b4ec24d54c2482c19c/23_73_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e440ab8ba46c765bf87bfd37b2925726","title":"story bagpusss magical folk soundtrack sandra kerr john faulkner oliver postgate","story":"Sandra Kerr and John Faulkner on recording the music for the 1974 series about ‘a saggy old cloth cat’, stress-tested by Ewan McColl and Peggy Seeger – and endorsed by Belle and SebastianLast year, Sandra Kerr retired from her job at Newcastle University, where she had taught a course on “traditions of these islands” for the music department. “Through the whole 17 years,” she says, “I’ve had students say to me that Bagpuss was their first introduction to traditional music. That’s enormously pleasing, to think that young people who have gone on to get attention and admiration for their music might have started with hearing the music for Bagpuss.”Bagpuss, of course, was the most important, the most beautiful, the most magical saggy old cloth cat in the whole wide world. He lived in a shop window, deposited there – along with the mice and their mouse organ, the carved woodpecker bookend known as Professor Yaffle, Madeleine the rag doll, and Gabriel the toad – by a little girl called Emily, who brought back objects that would inspire flights of fancy as the toys came to life. Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin’s stop-frame animation ran for only 13 episodes in early 1974, but through repeats imprinted itself on the consciousness of successive generations. And alongside the magical stories, the music made for the series by Kerr and her then husband, John Faulkner, seeped into the imaginations of musicians and music lovers. Now all the music they recorded for Bagpuss – alongside outtakes and alternate versions – is getting the reissue it deserves, in a beautiful book-style package, from Earth Records.Kerr and Faulkner were, on the face of it, unlikely candidates to soundtrack a children’s TV series. They met in 1963, through the folk scene – both were at first enraptured by skiffle and US roots music – but something else happened that changed their musical orientation. “I went off to live with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, to be their au pair and folk apprentice,” Kerr says. “That does sound like an extraordinary job description, doesn’t it? I was completely and utterly over the moon with that. I had one-to-ones with Ewan in things like the social and political history of folk songs. With Peggy, I had formal musicology and guitar lessons. I was very fortunate indeed to have that year it was my folk degree.”The young couple were invited by MacColl into an informal gathering he established, the London Critics Group. “We felt we had a mission to promote British folk songs and folklore, which were being ignored because of the influence of American music,” Faulkner says.“The first thing I always think about was how exciting it all was,” Kerr says. “There we were with one of the architects of the folk revival, and with Peggy, and every week we were in their house listening to traditional singers, analysing what they did, singing ourselves, and learning to critique what they did. We studied hard and worked incredibly hard.”The pair have different memories of how, in 1973, they came to be approached by Postgate. “Oliver, who didn’t know me and Sandra, knew Ewan.” Faulkner says. “I think there was a connection through his father, Raymond, who was a socialist historian. I think Oliver contacted Ewan and explained he was doing a series, and asked if Ewan could recommend anyone who might be interested in making music for it.”Kerr’s version begins with her and Faulkner supplying the theme for Sam on Boffs’ Island, a series written by Michael Rosen for schools television, starring Tony Robinson, Miriam Margolyes and Michael Rosen. “The producer, Claire Chovil, had lunch with Oliver. He said he was doing a new series about a saggy old cloth cat and he wanted a different kind of music for it. She said she had just worked with a couple who had played hundreds of instruments, which was us.”Faulkner says: “He explained what these programmes were about, and they were sort of experimental, in the sense that he liked the idea of using music that was traditional-based, because the stories he had written were very folky. He wanted something more bedrock, and we could provide the kinds of instruments I don’t think he’d considered – autoharp, mandolin, concertina.”Both remember making the Bagpuss music to be a delight. Postgate would tell them the stories he was telling in the episodes, sometimes supplying them with lyrics to set to music, and they would compose around his suggestions. “He would give us a lyric, like The Bony King of Nowhere,” Faulkner says, “and say: ‘Can you write a melody for that?’ We would go away and throw it around, then record a tune to cassette. Because of what we were presenting, he started to think of it as music-led. I think it’s true to say that he was inspired by what we were giving him, and we were certainly inspired by what he was giving us.”The pair were inspired by many different strands of traditional music of the British Isles: the Irish traditional song Brian O’Lynn makes an appearance for The Weaving Song, they set Postgate’s words to an old Scottish tune called The Calton Weaver. One of the most recognisable pieces – the mouse round, We Will Fix It – dated back centuries. “I think we had just recorded Sumer Is Icumen In with the Critics Group,” Kerr says, “and, when Oliver said he wanted a little round, that must have been in my head.”The results were magical. The unusual instrumentation – with concertina, Appalachian dulcimer and autoharp prominent – gives the music a timeless, otherworldly feel that is almost hallucinatory in its quality (in his sleevenotes for the reissue, Stewart Lee suggests that it has influenced acid folk). And the very best of the music – The Miller’s Song, for example – is so good you can’t believe it was recorded for a lunchtime children’s TV programme. “That’s my favourite,” Kerr says. “And Oliver loved that song in particular. I still sing it, and people respond to it whether or not they were Bagpuss fans, so I suppose it has entered the folk tradition, which is very gratifying.”Of course, the original audience for Bagpuss barely comprehended the music in their infancy, but as they grew older, its wondrousness became apparent. “It wouldn’t surprise some people to hear that in the days before iPads, when we went on tour we used to watch videos on the bus, and one of the regular things was Bagpuss videos,” says Sarah Martin of Belle and Sebastian. “I remember sitting on the bus watching it with Chris Geddes and The Miller’s Song came on, and we both said: ‘What a great song.’ You’re not aware of it as a kid, because it’s quite wordy and meaningful, but to find a gem like that on a children’s TV show is extraordinary.”• The Music from Bagpuss is out now on Earth Recordings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e44dc10db4a71291fb943ceeba67d7a20343a0/0_141_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edb28840f19a8062635a0904aa02ce24","title":"poverty in britain a social calamity","story":"As part of his field work for a damning report into poverty in the UK, Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur, visited Newcastle where he found people struggling to negotiate the benefits system and going hungry.

We are not so proud that we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody. But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying.”She added: “But we look forward to working with experts in the area, to make sure we get the right outcome for the people who we want to look after.”Asked about the tone of the UN report, May’s spokesman said: “We strongly disagree with the analysis.”More generally on universal credit, which is designed to replace six separate benefits but which charities and councils have warned is overly complex and often puts new claimants into debt, Rudd struck a more conciliatory note. She promised to try to improve the system but offered no new policy specifics.Asked by the SNP’s Neil Gray to use her influence in cabinet to listen to charities and halt the rollout of the system, Rudd replied: “I wouldn’t want to overstate what the honourable gentleman calls my power, but I am certainly going to listen very carefully.“Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years – and we will certainly be doing it.”In response to another question on claimants’ access to emergency payments to tide them over as they move to universal credit, Rudd said: “We have already made some adjustments to that and I will make sure that I do all I can to ensure that we do better.”She promised to deliver “a fair, compassionate and efficient benefits system”, adding: “But I know there are problems with universal credit, despite its good intentions. I’ve seen them for myself. I will be listening and learning from the expert groups in this area who do such good work. I know it can be better. I will make sure it is my role to deliver that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78a6b91fc7821d76ab432cae63c13dc57b5fb717/853_42_2005_1203/master/2005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131e8832eb4b20957a919e68f71e7169","title":"energy minister claire perry accused of swearing and shouting at staff unions civil servants","story":"Unions write to top official at BEIS department saying claims were raised by civil servantsTrade unions have written to the top official in the business department to raise concerns about claims that the energy minister, Claire Perry, has sworn and screamed at civil servants, the  understands.Representatives of three unions representing Whitehall officials wrote a joint letter to Alex Chisholm, permanent secretary at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), citing wider concerns about the behaviour of its ministers.The letter, from the PCS, FDA and Prospect unions, said the claims had been raised by BEIS staff, but that the unions could not detail specific instances owing to concerns that iniduals involved could be identified.They singled out the alleged behaviour of Perry, claiming there had been a series of reports about her alleged behaviour towards her civil servants.It is understood that the complaints given to the unions include claims that Perry screamed and shouted, texted one civil servant to say “Fuck off”, and wrote, “What’s this shit?” on a memo produced by staff. The MP for Devizes became energy minister in June last year, a role that involves attending cabinet.The letter, sent earlier this month, has not been made public, and the unions involved have declined to comment.Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, urged the department to act on the letter. “The unions have raised serious allegations, and we’ve got to look into them carefully,” he said.“All ministers, however important, must pay close attention to relations with their staff, and avoid any conduct that could be seen as unprofessional. Bullying is totally unacceptable in any workplace.”In January, the government updated the official code for ministerial conduct, featuring an expanded section on bullying and harassment.The code says ministers’ working relationships with civil servants and others “should be proper and appropriate”.It continues: “Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the ministerial code and will not be tolerated.”A spokesman for BEIS said: “Like all government departments we are committed to ensuring that our staff are treated with respect. We have clear codes of conduct in place, with high standards expected of all.“Any complaints or grievances made by staff are investigated following agreed internal processes.”BEIS had no specific response to the claims raised but noted that the results of staff surveys showed it was among the best-performing Whitehall departments for the fair treatment of staff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92361abc1043d27ff9fd6186913c815f67ac5953/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9db6b9f7ce07d6bdb53613fe1f6be3","title":"brexit dup defends not backing may on budget saying consequences were inevitable politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenAccording to the BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler, Theresa May is not going to have much chance to alter the text of what the EU agrees on the framework for the future relationship later this week. A seven-page outline (pdf) has already been published, but a longer version is being drafted, to go alongside the text of the withdrawal agreement that is now regarded as finalised.Here are some more quotes from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MP pushing for a harder Brexit. He was speaking to journalists after the ERG briefing earlier.I would wait and see about that. You speak to Tory MPs and find Tory MPs who say they are really keen that Theresa May should lead us into the next general election?Basically, if there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year. Getting the 48 letters has shown to be quite difficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point I don’t think that is realistic. I think it is now or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.This is interesting, because it is a new argument from Rees-Mogg as to why MPs should support him in voting against May. He is widening the issue beyond Brexit, which could be seen as recognition that she won’t be defeated in a confidence vote purely on Brexit grounds.I have suggested something and not everybody has wanted to do it. That’s political life.I felt I ought to go public because I have previously been so supportive of the prime minister. When I came to the conclusion that you couldn’t separate the person and the policy, I felt I had no choice but to write my own letter of no confidence.The government has put forward its proposal. It will have to bring it to a vote. There are many people who expect to oppose the deal in the vote and they think that is the time to write letters, not now, and that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.The UK government has been refused permission for an appeal at the country’s highest court over a cross-party legal challenge on Brexit, the Press Association reports. The supreme court rejected an application to appeal against a ruling to ask the European court if the UK can unilaterally revoke its article 50 request to leave the European Union. The Press Association story goes on:The court of session in Edinburgh ruled in September to refer the question to the court of justice of the EU (CJEU) after a case brought by a cross-party group of politicians. The CJEU applied its expedited procedure, as requested by the court of session, to the case and an oral hearing is fixed for November 27. The UK government made an application for permission to appeal against the ruling to the supreme court, which was refused by Lord Carloway, Scotland’s most senior judge and lord president of the court of session in Edinburgh, earlier this month. The secretary of state for exiting the European Union then applied directly to the supreme court for permission to appeal. But, refusing permission on Tuesday, the court said the court of session’s ruling was “preliminary” and it would still have to reach a judgment on the matter after the European court has given guidance. A statement issued by the supreme court said: “It is clear that this interlocutor did not constitute a final judgment.” It continued: “As both this court and the CJEU have made clear, the preliminary ruling is merely a step in the proceedings pending before the national court - it is that court which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision. “It will therefore remain for the court of session to give judgment in the light of the preliminary ruling, any relevant facts which it may find and any relevant rules of domestic law. It is only then that there will be a final judgment in the proceedings.” Here is a link to the ERG paper published earlier.While we’re on the subject of the Irish backstop, this is what Theresa May says about it in her article today for the Belfast . She says:Finally, there has been a lot of focus on the so-called backstop to this agreement that ensures that there can never be a return to the borders of the past in the event that we have not entered into our future relationship by 2021. Although it is important to restate that both sides agree that we never want to use it, and will both be legally bound to use our best endeavours to reach agreement on the future in good time, I understand and share some of the concerns that have been expressed.I believe the following three points make this an acceptable insurance policy: first, there is the opportunity to extend the Implementation Period instead of entering the backstop second, the Government will keep regulations consistent across the whole of the UK in order to minimise any checks or controls and ensure no ergence between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and third, this is expressly temporary, with a mechanism by which it can be terminated. And of course, in this situation, Northern Ireland would benefit from frictionless access to both the EU and the rest of the UK markets.The Conservative MP Damian Collins voted remain in the EU referendum. But in a blog for his website, he has said he will not vote for Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. He explains:There are many concerns about the prime minister’s draft agreement that could be raised, but for me there is a fundamental issue that needs to be resolved before I could support it. The draft agreement proposes that there should be a transition period after we leave the EU on 29th March next year, lasting until 31st December 2020, where we remain in the single market and customs union. This transition can be extended if both sides agree, and failing that we would fall into a backstop arrangement until a future trade agreement is reached. During this period the UK would be part of a single customs territory with the EU, requiring us to remain aligned to their rules. Furthermore it is proposed that we would not be able to leave the backstop independently, and I believe this is totally unacceptable. This arrangement would also require different rules to operate in Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, something that we had said we would not accept.Theresa May is to travel to Brussels on Wednesday evening to finalise the Brexit deal in a meeting with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, Downing Street has said. Our full story is here.Steve Baker, the ERG deputy chairman, has also been giving interviews. He says it is “very difficult” to see how there won’t be 48 Tory MPs demanding a no confidence vote in Theresa May if she loses the “meaningful vote”. But he does not know if the 48 letters will go in beforehand, he says.Here are the key quotes from Jacob Rees-Mogg on the Tory leadership. Asked why the necessary 48 letters to force a confidence vote had not materialised, he said:Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace. We will see what letters come in due time.Do 47 want to come with me or not? I may find that they don’t or they don’t do it today but when we get the meaningful vote. That’s a decision for them.He also said the government was determined not to deliver a meaningful Brexit.What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit. We have a government led by remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible.Jacob Rees-Mogg is now conducting a TV interview, with a huddle of around 20 journalists surrounding him.I can’t get close enough to hear what is being said, but a colleague is embedded in the scrum, so I’ll find out soon enough.I’m heading back to the office. I will post again in about 10 minutes.Rees-Mogg says, like Theresa May, he is opposed to the use of language like that. He says talk of the night of the long knives is particularly inappropriate coming from German TV.Q: Yesterday the Northern Ireland secretary (Karen Bradley) said if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, there would have to be border checks in Ireland under WTO rules.

The hair loss can remain as patchy hair loss or can continue until all hair on the scalp is lost (Alopecia Totalis or AT) or complete loss of hair from the body (Alopecia Universalis or AU). The immune system, the body’s natural defence which normally protects from viruses and bacteria, mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, leading to hair loss.To raise awareness about the condition,  photographer Graeme Robertson would like to find people in the UK who are affected by Alopecia Areata to take part in a new  photography project, supported by the leading hair loss charity, Alopecia UK.Graeme himself is affected by this form of alopecia and wants to give a platform to other people who have the condition.

Baby waves – or so they seem from above – peel left across the town’s northern beach and there’s barely a sign that this stretch of water is considered one of the most monstrous surf spots in the world.“It’s impossible to visualise it on a day like today when it’s beautiful and sunny but sometimes it gets big out there and sometimes it gets to the next level, beyond the realms ...” says the surfer Andrew Cotton, tapering off as he considers how best to describe the 60ft wave that flattened him exactly a year ago. “It’s like moving mountains,” he adds.“It’s disorganised, it’s really tricky to surf, there are peaks everywhere, you get these crazy, crazy teepees with loads of energy, and when the waves break right in front of the lighthouse it’s like woah! Without doubt it’s the riskiest spot in the world to surf.”Cotton knows first-hand about the risks at Nazaré, where a deep offshore canyon funnels the ocean towards the headland and, during certain winter swells, creates waves up to seven storeys high.Last November, the 36-year-old Devon surfer was hit on the head by a mammoth wave before being spat 20ft into the air, the momentum eventually slamming him down onto the surface of the ocean with such force that it broke his back.It was dubbed a “liquid catapult into space” by the World Surf League big wave awards. Cotton remembers it all with eerie detail.“When I was checking the swell that morning I was seeing giant, perfect lefts,” he says. “I mind-surfed them and I knew exactly what I wanted from the day: I wanted to be in a 60ft barrel. Getting barrelled at three feet is amazing but getting barrelled at 60ft, that’s the dream.“It was probably my fourth wave of the day and I was like, ‘this is it, I’m going to send it’, but it went from being the best wave I’d ever seen to being possibly the worst. Suddenly I knew the lip wasn’t going to throw out as far as I expected. I could see it feathering above me so I hit the eject button and jumped off.“I never jump off my board,” he stresses, the panic recounted in his voice, “but instincts just took over”. The moments that followed were amongst the strangest of his surfing career.“I’ve fallen off my board a lot in the last 30 years and this time was weird, like nothing else,” he says. “I was having this weightless feeling and I thought maybe I was in the centre of the wave. I thought to myself ‘maybe I could’ve ridden this out’. And then bang! I landed so hard. When that impact happened I was like ‘I’m done’.”Was it painful? “Umm, yeah,” he says with bewilderment, as if the feeling was almost beyond register. “It was like jumping off the top of a building on to concrete.”Cotton was swept under by the ensuing white water and took a second, huge wave on the head before being rescued by his tow-surfing colleague, Hugo Vau. The pair eventually made it back to the beach, where Vau lost control of the jetski and spilled Cotton onto the sand, adding injury to injury. Needless to say, Cotton won the WSL Wipeout of the Year award.Having suffered an L2 vertebrae compression fracture, he was initially unable to walk. “At first I was on pain killers and I was like ‘it’s not that bad’,” he recalls. “But after a few days they put a body brace on me to see if I could stand up. I couldn’t even put my feet off the bed. Garrett (McNamara) and Hugo were there and I could see on their faces I’d really fucked up.”It has taken 12 months of intensive rehabilitation for Cotton to fully recover. As he wanders around the shipping hanger in Nazaré where Red Bull athletes keep their kit – where photos of past triumphs and remnants of broken boards decorate the walls – he’s feeling grateful to be back on his feet, back in town, back in the water.He checks his inflatable life vest and CO2 canisters, prepares the first aid kit which includes military-grade tourniquet dressings, and speaks of a mental comeback as much as a physical one.“Some days you go on internet binges looking at waves and all your mates having fun and you’re like, will I ever do that again?” he says. “I don’t think you know how much a wipeout like that changes you until you come back.“It would have been really easy to say ‘forget it’. I’ve got a family, I’m a qualified plumber, I’ve got other stuff going on in my life. Plumbing can get pretty exciting if you’ve got a leak going on!Last week, in the first significant swell of the season, Cotton surfed waves that were around 40ft high. He suffered another wipeout, this time snapping his board in two instead of his back. That experience fortified his belief that he’s ready to scale Nazaré’s moving mountains again.“Of course there was fear when I first came back here,” he says. “I was nervous, shaking a little bit with the adrenalin, but I said to myself it’s a long winter, just build your way back slowly.”Over the coming months he hopes to set new benchmarks while “drawing exciting, critical lines”. And having towed McNamara into a then world record wave at Nazaré in 2011 – the moment when Nazaré first caught global attention – Cotton is determined to add his own record to his ignominious wipeout award.On reflection, he muses: “Sometimes you have to endure the worst situation to get to experience the best.”• To find out more about Andrew Cotton, visit Redbull"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9a168c7450af36c0593d29e0db6e26f3cd208d/0_143_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d16634602af86e96abefc5aa1549305","title":"folau foley england australia rugby union pocock samu","story":"Key Australia attacking talents Israel Folau and Bernard Foley have been stuck with a sickness bug, plunging their fitness into doubt for Saturday’s England Test. The Wallabies have confirmed that full-back Folau and fly-half Foley have not trained yet this week as 10 of the travelling contingent - a mix of players and staff - have been laid low by illness. Back-row forward David Pocock is yet to train this week too due to a neck problem, with Australia still hoping the influential trio could be ready come the weekend.“Israel Folau and Bernard Foley are still recovering from a stomach bug that cropped up at the end of last week,” said an Australia spokesman.Lock Izack Rodda insisted that the majority of the Wallabies camp have been kept away from those still harbouring illness.“I think there’s been a few players and a couple of staff unwell, but it’s been contained so it’s pretty good,” said Rodda.Pete Samu is primed to slot into Australia’s line-up should Pocock miss out through injury.England’s head coach, Eddie Jones, however, had insisted he would pay no heed to Pocock’s early-week training absence on Monday night, saying: “When I heard it I thought ‘here we go again’.”But Samu was adamant Australia would not play fast and loose with fitness updates. “Yeah well Eddie (Jones) probably thinks it’s mind games from us, but if he’s not right, he’s not right,” said Samu. “He missed training yesterday, so we’ll give him every opportunity to be right this week, and go from there.”Asked how he would approach potentially replacing Pocock, Samu continued: “I’m ready for the challenge, if it comes to that. I think the coaches and staff will give Pocock every opportunity to be right for the game. If it comes to that then I’ll be good to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4472b5d23ef17a61bf9dcea99e5d3f6de6f2c0/222_76_4276_2567/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c11ad13c338776305a6626e751eca27","title":"jack leach ajaz patel left arm the spin cricket","story":"Rangana Herath did not want to end his Test career with a defeat in Galle but in the early days of the Sri Lankan’s new life as a retired cricketer, he may well have afforded himself just a little smile at two fellow purveyors of left-arm spin, Jack Leach and Ajaz Patel, bowling their sides, England and New Zealand, to famous away victories.A good man by all accounts, Test cricket’s most prolific exponent of the art would probably enjoy the respective stories of their ascent to the highest level too (even if Leach is delivering against Herath’s former teammates right now), arriving as they have on the international stage not after some frictionless progression up the ranks but through dogged persistence and differing degrees of personal reinvention.Patel first, who on Monday spun New Zealand to an utterly compelling four-run win over Pakistan in Abu Dhabi – the fifth smallest margin of victory in Test history – with figures of five for 59 on debut. His, too, was the final match-winning, gut-wrenching wicket of Azhar Ali, lbw for 65, as a lovely flighted delivery dipped into the line of the right-hander’s leg stump before turning past the outside edge and thudding the front pad bang in line.The futile review that followed was merely one final slap around the chops for the handful of Pakistan supporters in the ground who had watched their side get to within 41 of a 176-run target with six wickets in hand, only to wilt in the desert. For New Zealand, it was the spark for wild celebrations that continued into the dressing room and featured some lively Punjabi dancing from Jeet Raval and Ish Sodhi, who along with Patel make up a trio of Indian-born players in this Kiwi side.All three emigrated when they were young – Raval when he was 16, the other two aged four - and of them it is the 30-year-old Patel, born in Mumbai, who can be considered the late bloomer by some distance given he was still sending down left-arm seam in club cricket aged 21. After an acceptance that his 5ft 6in height would limit progress, he turned to spin and sought out the guidance of Dipak Patel, the former New Zealand all-rounder whose off-breaks were used as a then-pioneering new-ball weapon in the 1992 World Cup.“He came to see me about converting to spin and really, to be honest with you, from the very first moment I saw him bowl spin, he was a natural,” Dipak Patel told Radio New Zealand. “The thing about it is, he’s got the ability to spin the ball and from there on it’s an art and you learn and it takes a long time and I think he’s reaping the rewards from that.”The rewards have certainly come in the past three years when Patel has finished each season as the leading wicket-taker in New Zealand’s Plunket Shield, including 48 at 21 runs apiece as Central Districts were crowned champions in April. As he stood on the boundary’s edge at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Monday, fielding questions from the ever-zany Danny Morrison about his remarkable Test debut, his metamorphosis was complete.As regards Leach, to watch the smile break out below that frightful Movember moustache as he claimed the final Sri Lankan wicket on Sunday morning – the No 11, Malinda Pushpakumara, cue-ending a return catch – was to see the bounty paid out for a different kind of reinvention. His has been technically minor in comparison but arguably the more challenging for a bowler, given the crossroads his career was at two years ago.While his current spin bowling colleagues, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, were part of an England attack shipping 759 for six against India in Chennai in late 2016, the bowler known as “Nut” in Taunton was still coming to terms with the detection of a previously unspotted kink in his action which was picked up by some routine biomechanic screening during a Lions training camp at Loughborough.An arm straightening of more than the permitted 15 degrees just after passing shoulder height but well before release – technically illegal but offering no obvious advantage – meant a period of rehabilitation and battling the dreaded stigma attached to chucking. Inner resolve was required, something Leach can now be said to have in spades along with the smooth, strong and repeatable action that all spinner’s crave.As well managing Crohn’s disease since a teenage diagnosis, Leach has not exactly had fortune on his side as regards injuries either. In 2015 he fractured his skull on a bathroom sink after fainting. And in May this year, when looking certain to continue on from his Test debut in Christchurch, he first suffered a broken left thumb during a pre-match net and then, six weeks later in his comeback game for Somerset against Surrey, concussion courtesy of a Morne Morkel bouncer to the head.If patience is the spinner’s ally (and just not for the injury-related reasons above) then on turning tracks so too is having the fortitude to cope with expectation. Doubtless it has helped being one of three in this current England side, as has his schooling on Taunton’s regular turners, but Leach has still belied his relative inexperience on tour. As the spinner who has offered Joe Root the most control across the first two Tests – his 13 wickets is just one fewer than Moeen too – the question now is who makes way when conditions mean at least one of the three muske-twiddlers is benched.There is one Test to go first, of course, starting in Colombo this Friday, while for Patel and New Zealand, they sit 1-0 up with two to play. As the dust settles on Herath’s recent exit from the stage, the Spin will be watching with interest to see how two of Test cricket’s newest left-armers fare in the weeks, months and hopefully years to come.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

This is what you love so much about the game.”The Coliseum’s first Monday night game since 1985 was worth the wait – and if this fascinating spectacle turns out to be a Super Bowl preview, Atlanta should prepare for an All-Madden-level show from two of the most exciting teams in the league.“It was one of the most competitive games I’ve been a part of,” McVay said. “It was just a competitive game with a lot of high-caliber football in all three phases.”Rams linebacker Samson Ebukam returned a fumble and an interception for the first two TDs of his NFL career, while Kansas City’s Allen Bailey returned Goff’s fumble for a go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter.The second half was an extended thriller featuring 59 combined points, but the Rams made slightly more big plays down the stretch.After Goff led a 75-yard scoring drive in 89 seconds for the go-ahead TD to Everett, former Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters intercepted Mahomes’ underthrown ball near midfield with 1:18 to play.The Rams only managed to get 14 seconds off the clock on their next three plays, and the Coliseum roiled in anticipation of a big finish by Mahomes. But the Chiefs were pushed back to their 13 with 50 seconds left thanks to a booming punt by Johnny Hekker, and Joyner intercepted Mahomes’ final desperate heave with 13 seconds left.This game has loomed in capital letters on the NFL’s regular season schedule ever since these teams confirmed their status as offensive powerhouses in September. Along with New Orleans and New England, the Rams and Chiefs are the league’s biggest favorites for long postseason runs.But before January, these offensive powerhouses put on a show for a prime-time audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f9cd825c11c77f29afeae0dbd24332d0ed4d48/185_1829_3321_1993/master/3321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87abd6a85b475606a85ffb314ce76ea0","title":"comedy duos lazy susan norris and parker soho theatre london","story":"Sharing bedrooms and backstage nerves, Lazy Susan and Norris \u0026amp Parker reveal the intertwined lives of the double actFreya Parker: We started out as a trio called Lebensmüde. It was such a mistake to have a name no one can pronounce – or spell! Schadenfreude was already taken.I’d been doing a fringe play with my friend Ed who thought Celeste and I would get along. The three of us set out to write theatre together. The results were really worthy, just needlessly bleak. We booked a scratch night in Peckham. As it rapidly approached, we thought we couldn’t do this awful play about two little boys in a bunker. Instead, we did some sketches and jokes, then went to Edinburgh as a trio in 2013. After Ed went back into academia, Celeste and I did another Edinburgh – as Lazy Susan – and we got nominated for the comedy newcomer award.We spend an enormous amount of time together. In Edinburgh, we share a room and it’s quite intense. As soon as you open your eyes in the morning it’s like: “Hey! It’s me again! Hello!” In the first week of the festival, you’re up until the small hours every night rewriting.When we’re creating a show we’ll each come in with a scrap of an idea, a draft of a sketch or a character. We put music on and shoot the shit. We record ourselves improvising on our phones or jot things down. Friends have said to me: “Don’t put that in a sketch!” You can’t help but put your own life into your comedy but we’d never humiliate someone without their consent.Celeste and I find the same things funny, but my sense of humour is maybe a bit more surreal. I’m definitely the weirder one.Celeste Dring: Freya and I have got to a point now where we don’t take ourselves too seriously. There are jokes I can write about Freya that I feel she can take. We wanted to put more of ourselves into our new show. Freya is hyper-vigilant, and a few years ago I’d have felt like it was a criticism to draw attention to it. But the beginnings of this show were her hyper-vigilance and a joke about me being a bit sleazy. We wanted to write about fear and gender and make it personal to us.We started out doing comedy a bit tentatively because we were so bad at theatre. I’m quite terrified by how little I understand our process. You never feel like you really know how to do it. We usually work at Freya’s flat or mine. It’s important to be able to move around – we go outside and run about, do some stretching. If you’re in a coffee shop, you can get a bit too chatty. We wish we had a studio but we just can’t afford it.On acting jobs I’m quite spooked if people don’t have comedic impulses. Basically, what I’m saying is I get spooked if people don’t laugh at my jokes. I joke a lot in between takes because I’m so used to doing that in live comedy.I went on holiday for two weeks last year – that’s the longest I’ve gone without seeing Freya. It’s just like being in a long-term relationship. We have to block in time off together where we’re not working – like a couple who have been married for a long time and have to schedule in sex. We’re going bowling next week, but that’s mostly to enjoy the hilarity of Freya’s overarm bowl.Katie Norris: We’re shackled together. Sinead says I’m her blood supply and she’s my albatross. We weren’t sure of each other when we met at drama school in Manchester. Sinead’s quite shy I was really ballsy and had a bad fake tan. We have the same birthday so were forced to plan a joint night out at Manchester’s Comedy Store where we watched loads of male standups. Sinead was horrified I thought they were really funny.We pushed the boundaries of our friendship quite early on, getting drunk and dancing to Kate Bush, taking our clothes off and running around to Wuthering Heights. After we moved in it became like Withnail and I. We bought a rabbit that roamed around the flat and shat on our cardboard cutout of David Cameron’s face.To write material we sometimes book an Airbnb. As I’m the responsible one, I do the driving and the cooking. Sometimes I accidentally spoon Sinead when we sleep in the same bed. We improvise, watch really dark documentaries, laugh together. When we’re writing, Sinead will sit with a laptop. If I could have a chaise longue I would.This year in Edinburgh I joined a spa and went there every day. Sinead couldn’t afford the spa and decided to become an agoraphobic. She stayed in bed for most of the day and only got up at 9pm for the show.Sinead Parker: Neither of us had done comedy before we got together. I did a one-woman show when Katie went to Keswick on a theatre job after drama school. I felt like a limb had been amputated. Katie talks about it as the best time of her life – she went running, didn’t really drink, got paid regularly. Meanwhile, I was going through a horrible breakup and doing a solo show. I perversely enjoy the fear of standup, thinking I’m going to absolutely bomb.We have a similarly cruel sense of humour. That’s how we bonded. Our boyfriends always find us really intimidating together because we’re a horrible combination. But we also like silliness and finding the absurdity in everyday things.I’d happily live with Katie now we’re both in London, but I think she’d like boundaries. We do have sleepovers. We take baths together, we poo in front of each other. Katie came with me once to a colposcopy. Before we go on stage, I always have to check Katie’s catsuit for wet patches.Our new show took longer to write than we’d expected. At the end of it, we had a song that made no sense and cut it after the first preview in Edinburgh. Then Katie had a fever dream that she wrote up as our ending.A compere once called us The Fertile Girls. Norris \u0026amp Parker is the most unimaginative name for a double act. As the more dominant one, Katie went first. But it has a better ring to it than Parker \u0026amp Norris.• Lazy Susan’s Forgive Me, Mother! is at Soho theatre, London, 18 December-5 January.

We took a private photo with a gift just given to us – we should have been more thoughtful.“Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all,” she added. “We failed to do that here \u0026amp we must do better to serve our customers in India.”That apology angered others, who argued Twitter should forthrightly oppose Brahminism, the system of beliefs and practices that perpetuates the place of Brahmins at the top of India’s social order.It was the latest misstep for a major Silicon Valley company in India, a frontier market where many technology firms have been focusing their resources as their customer bases in Europe, the US and Australia become saturated.India has about 330m smartphones in circulation, the second highest in the world, but it has the world’s largest offline population: more than 1 billion people in 2016, according to the World Bank. Hundreds of millions of Indians are expected to come online in the next decade.Twitter is estimated to have about 34.4m active monthly users in the country.Facebook attempted to give away a free, limited version of the internet in villages across India in 2015. But the plan, called Free Basics, was criticised as “digital colonialism” and was found to violate net neutrality.Snapchat also faced a public relations storm when a disgruntled former employee claimed its CEO, Evan Spiegel, had said the app was “only for rich people” and that he did not want to expand into “poor countries like India”. The company denies Spiegel made the remarks.Twitter, on its official account, seemed to sum up the situation in a tweet on Monday night. “Awkward,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a24995187054938505b72edaa8cb35949928d94/147_499_5281_3168/master/5281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f613edadfcde30c18a40bb7a08b2fae","title":"behind the scenes with the league of gentlemen a photo essay","story":"Photographer Sarah Lee was given exclusive access in Royston Vasey for The League of Gentlemen’s last performance of their live tour. Gareth McLean reflects on 20 years of the League and speaks to the gents themselvesby  Gareth McLean Photographs by  Sarah LeeSince The League of Gentlemen graced the cover of  Weekend 17 years ago (and were interviewed by yours truly), Jeremy Dyson, Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith have been keeping themselves busy. Inidually, the trio have written and performed in Doctor Who, Psychoville, Inside No 9 and Sherlock. But the League still looms large. In the hearts of the British public, Royston Vasey residents found a home, however unlikely that seemed, given the monstrous, macabre or murderous natures of many. From Tubbs and Edward, Pauline, Ross and Mickey, to the Dentons, Papa Lazarou and Les McQueen, there’s someone for everyone in Royston Vasey. Gay, straight or bi, give us a try. And that, I think, is what The League of Gentlemen is about, at least in part. The British have an obsession with community, and television a consequent preoccupation in (re)creating it – however illusory, idealised and, ultimately, isolating that idea is. The imagined standards with which we are forever presented as to what makes a “good” or typical community do not accord with reality that then feels defective – yet we tend to blame reality for falling short, not the idealised version for selling us a lie. The League of Gentlemen spoke to that frustration. As far as I can tell, Dyson, Gatiss, Pemberton and Shearsmith haven’t changed that much in 17 years. At heart, they’re still the (self-described) socially awkward, cheerfully morbid, wildly imaginative boys they’ve always been but they are also the men they were, but more so. Now they fill the likes of the Edinburgh Playhouse and the Hammersmith Apollo. It is, as Les McQueen might say, a shit business.“The appearance of Lazarou was always a great moment in the show. He arrived with a bit of misdirection – as people did not expect him to have been ordained to bishop!” Reece Shearsmith“I never regretted playing Plop Plop, as I felt it needed to be a ‘performance’ in itself: ‘skin work’, as it’s called. But it took discipline not to panic once I was entombed in the outfit.” Reece Shearsmith“Reverend Bernice was great fun to play. As with the last tour, we decided that she would return to her role as Agony Aunt and be on hand to impart her particular no-nonsense words of wisdom.” Reece Shearsmith“This photo depicts Steve and me at the start of act two. We have just been given a one-minute warning and so as you can see, our noses are going up with the sellotape.” Reece Shearsmith“Pauline’s lipstick is like Poirot’s moustache – the character just isn’t there until it’s applied. Makeup maestro Liv would slather on the lipgloss, then it’s one quick pout and she’s off (Pauline, not Liv).” Steve Pemberton“The dinner suits were our uniform, a blank canvas we could use to conjure up any characters we wanted. In this scene Ollie Plimsoles has written a play about his favourite subject: himself. We wanted to romp through a ‘greatest hits’ of Legz Akimbo Theatre Company, as well as highlight Ollie’s take on the past 70 years of British theatre. It was a thrilling end to the first half of the show and one of my favourite bits to perform.” Steve Pemberton“I’m so very fond of Les McQueen. He is based on someone real but he’s also very representative of a lot of people’s thwarted ambitions. He was nearly there. Eurovision (heats). He’s a total chump but his unflagging optimism keeps him going and going and going.” Mark Gatiss“I love that in this picture Reece appears to be the real Edward. It’s a genuinely creepy image. Smiling through shark’s teeth. I suppose that sort of sums ups the show ...” Mark Gatiss“This (last) photo makes me think of Hilda Ogden handling Stan’s glasses after he died in Coronation Street. The original stage Tubbs never wore glasses, but they were useful for hiding the wig gauze which we used on TV to pull the nose up.” Steve Pemberton“This sketch which was conceived as being a sort of Ultimate Dentons – a riff on an old live favourite that would play on the audience’s expectations of what they were going to see. This new sketch would add a number of other bodily emissions each one more extreme than the last.” Jeremy Dyson“Tubbs and Edward here flee Papa Lazarou’s about-to-be-destroyed wife mine. The fact that these two monsters were able to take a romantic plot where the audience is rooting for them is a source of mystery to us, to this day.” Jeremy Dyson“As we all know, the selfie has overtaken the autograph in recent years as the memento de nos jours.” Steve Pemberton“Here is the unfortunate Dr Matthew Chinnery, with the even-more unfortunate Plop-Plop, wonderfully played by Reece, a moment before his decapitation via laser beam. It was only when the whole script was compiled that we realised we’d produced an unrelenting tirade of filth and smut and that we would have to make some adjustments.” Jeremy Dyson"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704094.1542705963!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"penguin intervention on attenborough show defended by top film makers","story":"A BBC camera crew, working on David Attenborough\u0027s Dynasties series, take the very rare decision to intervene and rescue a group of penguins that had become trapped in a ravine.

Nature film-makers are discouraged from intervening in the events they are attempting to capture on film. While the general principle is to avoid interfering with the natural course of events, the crew on the Dynasties series stepped in when they saw the birds’ predicament. The penguins at the centre of Sunday’s episode of Dynasties had either blown or tumbled into a gully in a storm and were unable to to get out. In what BBC Earth described as an “unprecedented move”, the crew dug a shallow ramp so some of the penguins would be able to use it to save themselves. But Allan said he saw no problem with the film crew’s intervention. “Interfering or not is a decision based on what you’re seeing at the time. To interfere on a predation event is definitely wrong but, in this situation, they didn’t spook the penguins. All they did was create an escape route for them,” he said. Allan explained it would have been a far more stressful situation for the penguins had the film crew decided to pick them up and move them. He added: “I certainly think, in that case, what they did was entirely justifiable and entirely understandable. I would have done the same thing in their situation.” Philip Hoare, author and film-maker, said the crew were bound to upset someone whichever way they responded. He said he found himself in a similar position when he was in Sri Lanka filming sperm whales. When a group of killer whales appeared to hunt the sperm whales, he realised his boat was in between the predator and prey. “It was a very difficult thing to make a decision on,” he said, “I didn’t want to see any whales die, but there was a possibility that, by being there, we were frustrating one species’ natural instinct and need.” In that instance, his crew moved the boat. He added that it was impossible to document an encounter between a human and another species objectively. “This notion of purity of an encounter between a human and another species is absolutely ridiculous. There’s no possibility of that.” Mike Gunton, the executive producer of the series, also defended the crew’s decision to help the penguins. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: “In the 30 years I’ve been doing this, it’s one of the very few occasions when we’ve ever done anything like this because it’s a very unusual situation. Normally, you don’t interfere, you can’t interfere, or you wouldn’t interfere because of all sorts of consequences. “One, it would be very dangerous to do often for both you and the animal. Also, you’ll probably be changing the dynamics of the natural system or you might be depriving something of its food. But, in this particular situation, none of those things applied.” While it has previously been reported that Attenborough had opposed the move, saying that “tragedy is a part of life”, Gunton said that the presenter had told him he also would have rescued the penguins.–"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

found that iniduals whose commutes to their place of employment were longer than 45 minutes tended to move house in order to reduce their travel times.Conversely, those who started the study period with commutes shorter than 45 minutes were often prepared to increase their travel times in order to move to a better home or to reach a more desirable job located further away.The study also found that those who did not move house over the study period were more likely to have shorter commutes to begin with and to be home-owners with decent to high incomes.Meanwhile people who changed residences but remained at the same workplace, had middle-range incomes and upgraded from tenancy to ownership, which lengthened commutes.Top 10 | Most affordable commuter towns within 60 minutes of

The patient had undergone a liver transplant surgery in May 2017, and subsequently developed abnormal liver symptoms. Clinical tests later showed that he had contracted the rat hepatitis virus. Researchers ruled out infection via his blood and organ donors. Instead, they found his housing complex had evidence of rodent infestation, including droppings and piles of open garbage.The patient was cured over a few months with the help of antiviral drugs, though it likely took longer given his weakened immune system after surgery. In the most recent instance, the woman’s symptoms cleared within weeks and didn’t require medication.Both were believed to have been infected in 2017, and lived in the same Hong Kong neighbourhoods. However, scientists haven’t found a direct link between the two cases.Like many other cities around the world, Hong Kong officials have long battled rats, which were described to one local paper as being “as big as kittens.”Hepatitis affects the liver and is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water – for instance, by eating under-cooked meat or coming into contact with unclean water.The specific strain, hepatitis E, infects around 20 million people a year and is most prevalent in East and South Asia, according to the World Health Organisation.Symptoms can vary from mild discomfort to very severe some infections become life-threatening.The rat version, first discovered in 2010 in Germany, has a “very significant genetic difference” from the strains typically known to infect humans up until now, Dr Sridhar said.Canadian curlers booted from event for being drunkBrexit deal latest news: Spain threatens to veto agreement over Gibraltar clauseSpain wants \u0026#39wins\u0026#39 out of Brexit leverage on Gibraltar\u0026#39Big pharma\u0026#39 urged to develop treatments for global health Comment: France and Spain want to renegotiate the Brexit deal — so why can\u0026#39t we, Mrs May?Brexiteers like ‘Dad\u0026#39s Army’ battling to submit enough letters of no confidence, Jacob Rees-Mogg saysComment: A post-Brexit trade deal with Nigeria must not be at any price Sex and the City 3 would have killed Mr BigJudge blocks Donald Trump from denying asylum to people entering US illegallyWhat is the Brexit deal, and what happens next? Comment: The DUP are unpredictable, contradictory and defiant, but Mrs May needs them more than ever Netflix sparks outrage in Jordan after turning Amman street into \u0026#39Israel\u0026#39Police subdue 11-year-old boy threatening to cut his own throat in OhioBlack cab rapist John Worboys should stay in prison for rest of his life, Justice Secretary saysPapua New Guinean police and soldiers storm parliament over unpaid APEC summit bonusesComment: The EU\u0026#39s \u0026#39barmy army\u0026#39 is a fantasy no more — and only federalists will cheer thatThree men charged in Australia for allegedly plotting \u0026#39chilling\u0026#39 terror attacks in Melbourne Fighting resumes in Yemeni port of Hodeidah after UN drafts truce deal40-foot waves batter the Canary Islands after storm causes dozens to evacuateItaly orders seizure of migrant rescue ship Aquarius for \u0026#39illegal waste treatment\u0026#39Instagram users facing death threats after being accused of posing as black women onlineWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/20/12/apple-designer-jony-ive-work.jpg","title":"apple jony ive iphone designer stephen hawking fellowship lecture","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsApple designer Jony Ive delivered the Stephen Hawking Fellowship lecture at the Cambridge Union on 19 November, 2018\u0027I find it happens to me once or twice a day and that frequency of shifting between two such different ways of seeing and thinking is fantastically demanding\u0027Click to followThe Independent TechThe Cambridge Union is used for impassioned debates.

Our tools can be powerful, they can be beautiful, and on many occasions they\u0027re not motivated by understood or articulated needs.But though Ive works in the world of technology, he recognises it can be challenging.As an aside, it\u0027s interesting, isn\u0027t it, when we struggle with technology, we assume the issue is actually with us.

Firstly, I could actually use it. I loved using it and it became a very powerful tool that helped me design and create. Secondly, and I think this is in some ways a rather embarrassing admission because this was at the end of four years of studying design, I realised that what you make represents who you are.It stands testament to your values and your preoccupations, and using the Mac I sensed a clear and direct connection with the people who actually created the Macintosh. For the first time, I remember being moved by obvious humanity and care beyond just the functional imperative. This, he said, led to him finding out more about the people at Apple and moving to California in 1992 to join the team.Jony Ive was awarded the 2018 Professor Hawking Fellowship (Apple)But his most interesting thoughts concerned creativity and the nature of ideas. I spend my time at Apple in that intersection of art and technology. I think that, almost by definition, ideas are fragile. If they were resolved, if they were robust, they wouldn\u0027t be ideas any more, they would be shipping products, a finished album, a completed building. I\u0027m not really entirely sure why, but I think I\u0027ve always taken an enormous delight when the most tentative thought, often from the quietest voice, evolves into significant and substantial products.As he described the process that surrounded one interface project which began in around 2002 to 2003, he intriguingly revealed that the concept of the Apple App Store began a long time ago.This was a project that we came to describe as multi-touch. Some of you may remember the first time you experienced the interface. Perhaps it was on one of the first iPhones or later on an iPad. But multi-touch describes the ability to directly touch and interact with your content to be able to pinch to zoom an image or flick through a list with your fingers.Importantly, it defined an opportunity to create applications with their own unique, very specific interface. So, not being generic but being specific inherently describes the application\u0027s function. We came to see that we could make applications purposeful, compelling and intuitive to use. And so, as the potential for a vast range of apps became clear, so did the idea for an app store.But it took time before it could happen: In reality, the supporting technology, the enabling technology, took years to catch up with the ideas. And I have to say the ideas posed problems and defined challenges, but in the process, we came close to giving up on a number of occasions.Thankfully, they didn\u0027t give up. But ideas, he said, were not in response to a defined problems. Nobody asked us to solve a problem. They were not in response to a technological opportunity. These ideas, they weren\u0027t vulnerable or fragile for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months, these ideas were fragile for years.Still, after nearly 30 years at Apple, he is eager to create. I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredicability and the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there\u0027s nothing. There is no idea, there is no conversation, the room is silent, there\u0027s certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday?Collaboration is a key element, he said, even if this can lead to complexities. Without doubt, collaborating closely with multiple experts from different disciplines is one of my favorite aspects of being part of the team at Apple but this does present challenges that are a function of working as a large group. As a larger group, opinions often become confused with ideas. Opinions expressed in larger groups tend to focus on what is measurable, tangible and can be easily evaluated and communicated. That\u0027s why there\u0027s an obsession with attributes like size and weight and speed, capacity, schedule or price. But there often follows the dangerous assumption: we talk about these attributes because we think they\u0027re important.Apple\u0027s Jony Ive on how he created the But, common vision and shared purpose, Ive says, is not enough. When we genuinely look at a problem it\u0027s an opportunity to learn together, and we discover something together. We know that learning in community is powerful. It feeds and supports momentum which in turn encourages a familiarity and an acceptance of challenges associated with doing difficult things. And I\u0027ve come to learn that I think a desire to learn makes doing something new just a little less scary.He also described a paradox in the way he works which, he says, almost becomes absurd.There is a fundamental conflict between two very different ways of thinking. It is the conflict between curiosity and the resolve and focus that is necessary to solve problems. Curiosity, while it fuels and motivates, despite being utterly fundamental to the generation of ideas, in isolation just culminates in lots of long lists, perhaps some ideas, but alone that\u0027s sort of where it ends.The necessary resolve to find solutions to the problems that stand between a tentative thought and something substantial, that resolve and that focus very often seems in direct conflict with most creative behaviour. Honestly, I can\u0027t think of two ways of working, two different ways of being, that are more polar. On one hand to be constantly questioning, loving surprises, consumed with curiosity and yet on the other hand having to be utterly driven and completely focused to solve apparently insurmountable problems, even if those solutions are without precedent or reference. And so, of course, this is where it becomes sort of ironic and teeters towards the utterly absurd.You see, in the mode of being unreasonable and resolute, you have to solve hard problems. But solving those problems requires new ideas. And so, we\u0027re back to needing ideas and back to having to be open and curious. This is not a shift that occurs once or twice in a multi-year project. I find it happens to me once or twice a day and that frequency of shifting between two such different ways of seeing and thinking is fantastically demanding.He ended by quoting Steve Jobs, the late CEO of Apple, with whom he had a deep and incredibly fruitful creative relationship. As he read Jobs’ words, he slowed, seeming moved, as if hearing the words anew.I\u0027m going to read you something that my close friend and collaborator, the remarkable Steve Jobs, said about 10 years ago. I thought to conclude with his words rather than mine seemed entirely fitting. \u0027There\u0027s lots of ways to be as a person. People express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands. You never hear their story or tell yours but somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something is transmitted there. And it\u0027s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation.\u0027 Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To bag a bargain, do your research and don’t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.”Among the items Which? Found could be picked up for a better price outside of the Black Friday weekend was that the a 60” LG television advertised at £799 by Amazon during the promotion that was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.The Sony Cybershot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, but was found to be £10 cheaper in June and July last year and then again in December and January.The results suggest consumers should be careful about attributing too much value to discounts which may not be as good as they first appear.Despite the findings UK shoppers are expected to spend billions on the Black Friday period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A transition to WTO could look like no-deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Highways Agency officials told The Independent in June that\u0026nbspplanned Channel port lorry parks will definitely not be available by March 2019 – too late to help tackle the estimated 30-mile lorry queues Dover is expected to face in the event of a collapse in exit talks.Mr Carney stressed that a no-deal next March with no transition would be even more economically damaging.“This would be a large negative shock to the economy – no deal, no transition – there should be no doubt about that,” he said.The risk of the UK crashing out of the European Union as soon as next March has risen after\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspgave an almost universally hostile reception to Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement and draft Political Declaration last week.Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of chaotic Brexit next year was high, but that if it did happen the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates.Asked on Tuesday whether the chance of a no-deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”He also claimed the Bank of England would be something of a “sideshow” in the event of a chaotic Brexit.“This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.”“This is not a financial crisis round two, where the Bank of England and other central banks were centre-stage, this is a real economy shock and therefore central banks have a role but we’re more of a sideshow.”ost output, lost jobs, lower wages, higher inflation all things being equal.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks.

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon will go bankrupt, the billionaire said, replying\u0026nbspto an employee who asked him about the company\u0027s\u0026nbspfuture, in relation to the bankruptcies of big US retailers such as Sears.If you look at large companies, their lifes tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.Amazon picks New York City and Arlington for new headquartersA recording of the meeting was heard by\u0026nbspCNBC.In it, Mr Bezos\u0026nbspadded that the way for Amazon to stay successful is for staff to obsess over customers.If we start to focus on ourselves, instead of focusing on our customers, that will be the beginning of the end, he said.His comments accompany a wave of major success for Amazon, even as the company comes under heightened scrutiny.Amazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employeesOn Tuesday Amazon\u0026nbspannounced that New York City and Arlington, Virginia had been picked as the locations for its new headquarters, with a $5bn investment planned across both sites.Both Amazon\u0026nbspand local authorities in New York attracted heavy criticism after the company\u0026nbsprevealed that it would receive around $1.5bn in incentives,\u0026nbspbased on job creation targets, in Long Island City, and $573m in Arlington.\u0026nbspTwo of the sites chosen for Amazon\u0027s new campus in the city were originally intended for affordable housing and the decision is now likely to cost the city around 1,500 residential units intended for low and middle-income\u0026nbspNew Yorkers, according to\u0026nbspPolitico.\u0026nbspThe announcement followed an extensive beauty pageant process, which saw 238 competing proposals submitted from locations across the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAmazon, which now employs\u0026nbspmore than 600,000 people worldwide, said salaries at its two new bases would average more than $150,000, with hiring set to start next year.Staff at the company told\u0026nbspCNBC\u0026nbspthat employees are worried about the impact of government regulation and potential antitrust violations.In September the EU\u0027s antitrust watchdog launched a preliminary investigation\u0026nbspwhich is examining how Amazon uses data from\u0026nbspthird-party merchants.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Any miss is going to get punished in the current febrile climateClick to followThe IndependentAn enlarged note minted by Clydesdale Bank, part of CYBG whose shares were hammeredBrexit pigeons are coming home to roost, as the latest CYBG results make clear.\u0026nbspThe group, which owns Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks and is\u0026nbspseeking the status of top challenger to the market’s big guns in the wake of its merger with Virgin Money, endured a brutal kicking on the stock market after their release.\u0026nbspNearly 10 per cent was wiped from its\u0026nbspvalue during the morning session.\u0026nbspHow will CYBG and Virgin Money fare against the big five banks? Virgin Money and CYBG strike £1.7bn deal putting 1,500 jobs at riskCYBG set for Virgin merger but consumers shouldn’t get too excitedThe shares sell-off wasn’t just about brexit. The bank fell into a pre-tax loss for the year to the end of September, thanks largely to\u0026nbspa much bigger than expected provision to cover the cost of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) misselling. Shore Capital had hoped for a better idend than was offered too.\u0026nbspThe baleful influence of Brexit, however, exacerbated the negatives in the bank’s numbers.\u0026nbspShortly after the EU referendum in June 2016,\u0026nbspCYBG held a capital markets day when the banking group\u0026nbspsaid it expected the impact of the leave vote to be felt 18 to 24 months down the line. Those\u0026nbspcomments have proved prescient.\u0026nbspOutside of\u0026nbspthe PPI nasty, CYBG has a decent enough story to tell. Merging with Virgin Money should give it a shot in the arm. It is growing its mortgage\u0026nbspbusiness faster than the market. The money RBS is having to pump into small business lending to facilitate competition as a consequence of its failure to spin off or sell what would have been known as Williams \u0026amp Glyn should help\u0026nbspCYBG, which is also outperforming in\u0026nbspthis sector.\u0026nbspBut it is significant that the bank made note of the fact that some companies are sitting on their hands when it comes to investment, putting off decisions and hoarding cash in an attempt to protect themselves should our politicians wreck things for them.\u0026nbspThe behaviour of the governing Conservative Party, and its noisy corps of extremists, is scaring just about everyone in possession of a working brain.\u0026nbsp“Up and down the country, firms large and small are deeply concerned by the potential for a no-deal scenario, and business investment is already being choked off by the surrounding uncertainty,” said Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, as the bank was unveiling its results.\u0026nbspBut no deal is what the extremists want, even if they won’t quite come out and say so, regardless of the consequences.\u0026nbspIn this febrile climate any misstep on analysts’ forecasts is going to get punished. The market is in a\u0026nbspfretful\u0026nbspmood.

It still isn’t clear who was most at fault for the IT disaster that continues to do down the bank’s good name, and we’ll probably never know for certain. It is clear that Debbie Crosbie may be entering the lion’s den when she joins next year.\u0026nbspTSB appoints Debbie Crosbie as new chief executive TSB owner Sabadell hit by IT failure costs with more expectedTSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure In case you’d forgotten, TSB was spun out of Lloyds, enjoying a brief time as an independent business before Sabadell moved in. Following the deal, it was decided that TSB should move off Lloyds’ IT system, for which it was paying a pretty penny, and onto one provided by its new owner.Trouble is, the transfer went disastrously wrong, resulting in people being locked out of online banking, and creating a political and media furore. TSB’s poor employees, who spent hours on end in its branches dealing with furious customers, went through hell too.\u0026nbspThe bank further compounded the issue by initially trying to downplay it and by failing to keep aggrieved customers properly informed about what was happening.\u0026nbspPester was slow to apologise and then went and told MPs on the Treasury Committee that all was well and they should think about switching to TSB when members of the MPs\u0027 own staff had told them they couldn’t access their accounts that morning.\u0026nbspPutting right what went wrong will be a tough ask for anyone, but on the face of it, Crosbie looks like a smart choice on the part of Sabadell, and the bank’s embattled chairman Richard Meddings, to do that.She’s currently the chief operating officer of CYBG, another ‘challenger’, which hasn’t been free of IT problems. So she knows the territory, and presumably has a good idea of what it takes to succeed with a mid sized bank in the British market.\u0026nbspBefore TSB can do that it needs to convince its customers, regulators and MPs that it can be trusted and is fit for purpose. That will be at the top of Crosbie’s to do list. She may also have to deal with some awkward politics, although that’s not unusual in banking.\u0026nbspTSB’s issues could have made the role tough to fill. But Crosbie was apparently one of 30 names to be given consideration, and topped a shortlist of four.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

To bag a bargain, do your research and don’t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.”Among the items Which? Found could be picked up for a better price outside of the Black Friday weekend was that the a 60” LG television advertised at £799 by Amazon during the promotion that was £50 cheaper on at least 62 occasions after Black Friday and dropped a further £150 for at least four days at the end of December and beginning of January.The Sony Cybershot HX60B Superzoom compact camera was advertised as £189 (save £10) on Black Friday by Currys PC World, but was found to be £10 cheaper in June and July last year and then again in December and January.The results suggest consumers should be careful about attributing too much value to discounts which may not be as good as they first appear.Despite the findings UK shoppers are expected to spend billions on the Black Friday period.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A transition to WTO could look like no-deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Highways Agency officials told The Independent in June that\u0026nbspplanned Channel port lorry parks will definitely not be available by March 2019 – too late to help tackle the estimated 30-mile lorry queues Dover is expected to face in the event of a collapse in exit talks.Mr Carney stressed that a no-deal next March with no transition would be even more economically damaging.“This would be a large negative shock to the economy – no deal, no transition – there should be no doubt about that,” he said.The risk of the UK crashing out of the European Union as soon as next March has risen after\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspgave an almost universally hostile reception to Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement and draft Political Declaration last week.Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of chaotic Brexit next year was high, but that if it did happen the Bank could be forced to raise interest rates.Asked on Tuesday whether the chance of a no-deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”He also claimed the Bank of England would be something of a “sideshow” in the event of a chaotic Brexit.“This would be a very unusual situation. It is very rare to see a large negative supply shock in an advanced economy. You would have to stretch back at least in our analysis until the 1970s to find analogies.”“This is not a financial crisis round two, where the Bank of England and other central banks were centre-stage, this is a real economy shock and therefore central banks have a role but we’re more of a sideshow.”ost output, lost jobs, lower wages, higher inflation all things being equal.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The committee asked Threadneedle Street to provide an analysis of how the EU Withdrawal Agreement will “affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a \u0027no deal, no transition\u0027 scenario”.The central bank said it had changed the date for publication of the results of its annual stress tests of the UK’s major banks - during which it analyses how the country’s biggest lenders would cope with a variety of risks. Mars bars could run out in ‘weeks’ in the event of a no-deal BrexitNHS faces £2.3bn cost of no-deal Brexit, report warnsIgnore the hot air from cabinet members about a no-deal BrexitThe Bank’s Financial Stability Report will be published alongside the results of the stress tests on Wednesday, 28 December. They were previously scheduled to be released on 5 December. The timing has been changed to allow politicians to look over the Bank’s assessment before any parliamentary votes on Brexit. The Treasury Select Committee has previously asked the Bank to look at the scenario of transition to World Trade Organisation trading terms for the UK , which would be the default in the event of no deal.The Bank’s governor, Mark Carney, told the TSC on Tuesday: “The question has to be: in 20 months would we be ready to have in place all the customs arrangements…that are necessary for a WTO trading relationship with the European Union? A transition to WTO could look like no-deal, no transition, or it could look more like a seamless move to WTO. We’ll just expose all that so you can have a proper assessment of it.”Earlier this month Mr Carney said he did not think the risk of no-deal was high, and when asked whether the chance of a no-deal has now risen he said: “We’re going to find out relatively soon! Some of you may know already.”“We’ve always operated from the view that this might happen so get the system prepared. We’ve been preparing for it since the day after the referendum effectively. We’re quietly confident that we have in place all the measures we could have in place.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,\u0027 said Ms FairbairnThe money that firms are being forced to spend in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit next March is a waste, the director-general of the CBI has complained.In a speech to the business lobby group’s 2018 conference on Monday Carloyn Fairbairn said “not one penny of it will create new jobs or products”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“Brexit is consuming government – every politician, every civil servant. And it is also consuming British business,” she said.“Our firms are spending hundreds of millions of pounds preparing for the worst case – and not one penny of it will create new jobs or new products.“Investment is flooding out of the right areas like skills and tech, and into areas which do absolutely nothing to help our productivity. Some of it is leaving our country altogether. While other countries are forging a competitive future, Westminster seems to be living in its own narrow world, in which extreme positions are being allowed to dominate.”Despite the almost universally hostile political reception for Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, unveiled last week, the CBI\u0026nbsphas called on MPs to back it since it avoids the risk of a cliff-edge for firms on 29 March 2019.“The Prime Minister’s agreement is not perfect. It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress,” said Ms Fairbairn.A no-deal Brexit next March would be expected to ground UK flights and result in severe disruption of haulage deliveries through UK ports.UK-based manufacturers and retailers which have “just-in-time” supply chains have warned of major problems in such circumstances and said that they have limited facilities for stock-piling.Last week, Ms May told the House of Commons: “We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to united and support the best deal that can be negotiated”.In her speech, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspagain castigated Labour’s nationalisation plans, saying that when it was last tried in the 1970s “it ushered in one of the darkest periods in our country’s modern economic history”.But she also had a message for those hardline Brexiteers who have presented leaving the EU as an opportunity for wholesale deregulation.“Extreme market ideology does not get us much further. Becoming a hustling cowboy nation with minimal regulation is not what people want. Nor is it what business wants,” she said.On immigration, Ms Fairbairn\u0026nbspalso rejected the recent advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee that the Government should, post-Brexit, only allow in skilled workers who can command a salary of more than £30,000 and also the Governments pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.“What has been proposed so far won’t work,” she said.“The idea that anyone earning less than £30,000 can’t contribute to our economy, for instance. Together, we could do so much better – through a jointly developed immigration policy, one that avoids false choices, that does away with arbitrary targets, and focusses instead on the people we need to build our economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. There have persistent rumours since that this will be the last Coldplay album ever produced, although the band have yet to confirm their future.Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as dealing with the fallout from a major report into Facebook’s communications strategy, the announcement was made amid mounting\u0026nbspconcern that the internet\u0026nbspand social media giants like Facebook are not doing enough to help support local news organisations.Facebook did not say it would make\u0026nbspchanges to its news feed algorithm, which decides what news stories show up on users’ feeds. It also is not making any changes to the way it pays for the kind of journalists the scheme will help train.The new reporters\u0026nbspwill be trained as “community journalists” in the areas they will work, according to the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which will ensure that they gain qualifications through the process. And they will work at local newspapers owned by publishers\u0026nbspNewsquest, JPIMedia, Reach, Archant and the Midland News Association, all of which are taking part in the project.Facebook’s UK head of news partnerships Nick Wrenn said the announcement was in recognition of “the important role\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspplays in how people get their news today, and we want to do more to support local publishers”.It would aim to “encourage more reporting from towns which have lost their local newspaper and beat reporters,”\u0026nbsphe said.The organisations behind the scheme also said they would focus on hiring a erse set of new journalists for the scheme.“The NCTJ cares deeply about the number, quality and ersity of journalists working in our local communities,” said\u0026nbspNCTJ chief executive Joanne Butcher.“We are very proud to support the sustainability of quality local journalism by overseeing the recruitment of additional local news journalists from erse and inclusive backgrounds and by ensuring they are properly trained and qualified.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sixteen nations were involved in its construction. In addition to the US and Russia, those were: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. \u0026nbsp2. No fewer than 136 space flights from seven different types of craft were deployed to deliver parts to the engineers. The large modules were delivered on 42 assembly flights: 37 on US shuttles, five on Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets.3. The result is the largest manned object in space, 357ft long — just a yard short of a full-length American football field.4. The ISS weighs 419,725kg including the weight of spacecrafts, of which it can accommodate as many as six at any one time.5. It is the single most expensive object ever built at £93.4bn.6. It is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus.7. The ISS travels at a speed of 4.791 miles per second, fast enough to go to the moon and back in a single day.Nasa space shuttle Endeavour (Getty)8. At that pace it orbits the earth approximately once every 90 minutes or 16 times in a 24-hour period, meaning it passes through 16 sunsets and sunrises per day. It passes over 90 per cent of the earth’s population in the course of its orbital path.9. The space station has more living space than a six-bedroom house, offering six sleeping quarters, a gym and a 360-degree bay window, but only two bathrooms. There are no chairs either —\u0026nbspastronauts taking time out to eat their three square meals a day of canned and dehydrated food have to float\u0026nbspgently in zero gravity. The atmosphere aboard is aboard is described as having a “metallic-ionisation-type smell”.Aki Hoshide participates in extravehicular activity outside the International Space Station (NasaGetty)10. So far 230 people from 18 nations have visited the ISS\u0026nbspand it has been continuously occupied since November 2000.11. Nasa’s Peggy Whitson set the record for the longest time living and working in space at 665 days on 2 September 2017, before returning to earth the next day.12. Astronauts aboard have completed 205 spacewalks since 1998 to carry out construction jobs, maintenance and repairs.ISS crew members\u0026nbspfrom the Vatican (Reuters)13. The physical toll all this takes on astronauts is considerable: crew members need to work out in the station\u0027s gym for at least two hours a day to mitigate the loss of bone and muscle mass and maintain the normal bodily health they would experience on terra firma.14. Four different delivery craft supply the crew with food\u0026nbspand equipment: Orbital ATK’s Cygnus, SpaceX’s Dragon, JAXA’s HTV and the Russian Progress.15. A Water Recovery System on board reduces the astronauts\u0027 dependence on these cargo craft by 65 per cent through recycling.

Oxygen is generated by a process of electrolysis: current captured from the station’s acre of solar panels is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.17. The ISS\u0027s internal pressurised volume is 32,333 cubic feet, which is roughly equivalent to that of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.18. Software on board the ISS monitors 350,000 sensors checking in on crew health and safety. The station meanwhile carries 50 computers and eight miles of wire, enough to run around the perimeter of Central Park in New York City.19. The ISS provided the set for the first music video ever shot outside of our atmosphere when commander Chris Hadfield\u0026nbspmade a short film set to\u0026nbspDavid Bowie’s “Space Oddity” up there in May 2013.20. To mark its turning 20, the ISS is getting a Refabricator for a birthday present. The device is a hybrid recycler and 3D printer that melts plastics down so that new tools can be created.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Given its brightness, it is surprising it was not discovered a lot sooner.Nasa reveals more about mysterious \u0027alien spacecraft\u0027 asteroidThe swirling cloud of dust is a mere 8,000 light years from Earth is a vast system made up of two shockingly bright stars. The astronomers who found it named it Apep, after the Egyptian god of chaos, reflecting the intensity and vastness of the system but also the curling shape of the snake-god, which matches its whirling appearance.The two bright stars\u0026nbsporbit each other every hundred years or so, according to the researchers. As they do, a fast wind is thrown off, moving as fast as\u0026nbsp12 million kilometres an hour.Eventually the system is going to throw out a\u0026nbsplong-duration gamma-ray burst, according to the astronomers who found it. They can last just a couple of seconds but throw out as much energy as the sun will emit in its whole lifetime.The two stars appear to be rotating so fast that they are close to ripping each other apart. It\u0027s that fast rotation that scientists expect will mean that Apep is likely to throw out one of the GRBs\u0026nbspwhen its core collapses at the end of its life.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We on this side of the House will always engage with professionals, with experts, with NGOs, we are not so proud we don’t think we can learn as we try to adjust universal credit for the benefit of everybody.“But that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and discredited a lot of what he was saying, but we look forward to working with experts in the area to make sure we get the right outcome for the people we want to look after.”Amber Rudd becomes sixth DWP secretary in less than three yearsEarlier in the debate, Justin Tomlinson, minister for family support, housing and child maintenance, said the government “disagreed” with Mr Alston’s findings, and defended universal credit as a “simplified benefit system that helps some of the most vulnerable people in society”.The remarks from the new work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspand Mr Tomlinson will exacerbate concerns raised in the UN report that ministers are “in a state of denial”\u0026nbspover the state of poverty in\u0026nbspBritain.\u0026nbspDelivering his findings on Friday, Mr Alston\u0026nbspsaid: “What I found in my discussions with ministers, is basically a state of denial. The ministers with whom I met have told me that things are going well, that they don’t see any big problems, and they are happy with the way in which their policies are playing out.“But it’s of course not the story that I heard in my travels through Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and in quite a few cities in England.”After the Commons debate, Ms Greenwood told The Independent: Amber Rudd is in total denial about the damage caused by this government’s austerity policies. Instead of launching an attack on the UN, the government must properly respond to the detailed evidence presented by the special rapporteur.Created with Sketch.

They\u0026nbspwill consider it a major victory that the prime minister’s proposed deal will be officially compared with the potential merits of staying in the EU and\u0026nbspnot merely considered against the risks of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Umunna said the amendment could “change everything”.Writing exclusively for The Independent, he said: “In a big admission – given she has been peddling, for many weeks, the falsehood that the choice is between her deal and no deal – the PM conceded in the House of Commons last week that the country actually faces three choices: no Brexit no deal or her agreement.“Therefore it is only right that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare provided with an economic analysis with a comparison between those options. Anything less would amount to pulling the wool over the eyes of parliamentarians and the people we represent.\u0026nbsp“Let parliament see the figures, and then\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan weigh up just how bad the trajectory the country is on will be for our communities.”Theresa May: ‘It’s the future relationship that delivers on the Brexit vote. It’s the future relationship that actually says this is the right deal for the future for our country’Speaking after ministers agreed to back down, he added: “This was the first test of strength facing the People’s Vote campaign in parliament since the government published their draft deal, and it is one that we in the campaign have won after gaining support from all sides of the House.“The government was planning to con the British people. It is vital at this crucial time for our country that MPs and the public know the full facts about the cost of Brexit and how it compares to the deal we already have inside the EU.”The latest blow to the prime minister’s authority came as Tory Brexiteers scrambled to secure enough signatures to trigger a vote of no confidence in her.Despite claiming\u0026nbspthey would have reached the threshold of 48\u0026nbspby Monday night, the rebels appeared to still be short of support as their attempt to oust Ms May rapidly lost momentum.But Ms May faced a further headache as the DUP, whose votes she relies on in Parliament, broke their agreement to back the government on key issues and abstained during\u0026nbspseveral Finance Bill votes.\u0026nbspDUP abstain from crucial vote in warning over May’s Brexit agreementPro-Brexit Tories struggling to gather support for May challengeSpain threatens to reject Brexit deal over GibraltarNo-deal Brexit spending by UK firms a waste of money says CBIEight of the party’s ten\u0026nbspMPs also backed a Labour amendment on child poverty.It raises urgent questions over the future of the pact between the DUP and the Tories just weeks before Parliament is expected to hold the crunch vote on the prime minister’s Brexit plan.Ms May will need the DUP’s support if her deal is to have any chance of passing the Commons.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Concerns centre on four areas, the authors\u0026nbspsaid: ensuring criminals are kept out, relieving pressure on public services, ensuring access to good jobs, and promoting integration.Lord Adonis said: “The choice between EU membership and controlling migration is a false one. Electronic ID cards would mean we know exactly who is here and give us real control over access to out public services and entitlements.“A new Strengthening Communities Fund could pump £2bn\u0026nbspa year into the public services and infrastructure facing new demand, and we could have tougher minimum wage enforcement and new rules to ensure British workers have the first chance to apply for new jobs when they need it.“These policies are practical, actionable solutions to immigration that are already being deployed across Europe. I believe strongly that they will help to persuade voters that the best way to take back control is to stay in the EU and get serious about immigration and welfare enforcement - so let’s do that instead of trashing our economy on the basis of a false choice.”Created with Sketch.

This data could be used to inject fresh funding into public services in areas where immigration has surged.At the same time, Global Future said, the government should strengthen workers’ rights and set up “enforcement squads” to crack down on unscrupulous employers, including those that do not pay\u0026nbspthe minimum wage.And a new multi-billion pound Strengthening Communities Fund should be set up to help teach migrants English and encourage them to integrate within their communities, the think thank said. This would replace the existing Controlling Migration Fund.The investment should partly be used to reverse swingeing cuts to English language classes since 2010, it added.Peter Starkings, director of Global Future, said:\u0026nbsp“Free movement has been good for Britain – it’s boosted our economy, created jobs and helped millions of Brits live, work and study across Europe.

Let’s be clear and honest and tell the EU that’s what we are prepared to do.”Stop the posturing – MPs like David Davis have no idea about BrexitDavis says there will be ‘some hiccups’ if UK leaves EU without dealUnited Kingdom will ‘split apart’ because of Brexit, Spain warnsBritain will only enter into a transition phase if the government reaches a withdrawal agreement with the EU. Mr Davis was Brexit secretary when UK and EU negotiators agreed the terms of the transition period, due to run until the end of 2020.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, of the pro-EU group Best for Britain, said: These comments by David Davis are completely unbelievable. He is frankly just deluded or just plain stupid.“It seems like the man who was in charge of delivering Brexit doesn’t understand the process. You can’t have a transition without a deal and everyone knows that.“The truth is that there are two genuine options available to the parliament and to the country: firstly the government’s deal that loses us decision making power and would leave us worse off, and second, our current deal that would keep our prosperity, keep our say over EU laws and trade agreements and deliver what the majority of people in the UK now want.”Jon Worth, visiting professor in EU policy at Bruges’s\u0026nbspCollege of Europe, tweeted: “How the sodding hell has Britain had a Brexit Minister (Davis) who does not even understand the basic scheduling of the process? Or is so mendacious or lazy he doesn’t want to understand?”Mr Davis’s opinion piece – which he began by quoting a Spice Girls lyric – was published as Tory Brexiteers\u0026nbspstruggled to gather support for a leadership challenge on Theresa May.“What we need now is leadership and the courage and confidence to deliver for the UK,” he wrote, claiming “MPs, Party members and the British public are rightly dismayed” with the\u0026nbspprime minister’s proposed EU deal.It is not the first time Mr Davis has been accused of failing to fully understand the Brexit negotiations.\u0026nbspFormer Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, speaking about the implications for the Irish border,\u0026nbspsaid in January: “I continue to have my doubts – does he understand this stuff?”Mr Davis was also widely ridiculed for suggesting three weeks after the EU referendum that Britain would have completed most of its global trade deals “within between 12 and 24 months”.The Independent has contacted Mr Davis’s office for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know that genuine ‘parity of esteem’ will need resources as well as rhetoric,” Ms Rayner said.“But achieving a deep seated culture change, where employers both know and value different kinds of education, needs leadership from government as well. So a Labour Government will practise what it preaches.“We will end the snobbery that underpins attitudes towards different types of qualification and end the assumption that academic qualifications should be a basic entry requirement for jobs in Whitehall, limiting them to where they are necessary.“Government itself will lead the way in setting a clear example to other employers that a person’s skills and experience is as valuable as any particular type of qualification.“And we will ensure that those working at the heart of government become more representative of the country they serve.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

A third of those who replied were undecided.\u0026nbspThe majority (63.3 per cent) backed a second referendum when asked how the government could give people a say on the terms of Britain’s exit from the bloc, while 10.9 per cent suggested a public consultation.About 10 per cent said they trust the government to do a good job, and 7.4 per cent said the UK should just leave the EU.Kajal Odedra, executive director of change.org UK, said people feel “bombarded but gagged by Brexit”, regardless of whether they voted to leave or remain in the European Union.EU to decide whether Brits will need visas in event of no-deal BrexitVoters in most vulnerable Tory seats \u0027back fresh Brexit vote\u0027Every day takes us closer to giving the people the final say on BrexitThornberry says Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumCorbyn rejects calls for Final Say referendum, despite Labour backlashJohnson insists May can be forced into Final Say referendum on BrexitWriting exclusively for The Independent, Ms Odedra said: “The choices the government makes in negotiations are critical.\u0026nbsp“But they are being made far away from the public with no consultation whatsoever.\u0026nbsp“When we asked change.org users, only 7 per cent of those polled felt they have been given a chance for their voices to be heard since the referendum.“And 85 per cent felt they didn’t have any say in shaping the government’s Brexit strategy.”Leave voters were more likely to feel heard by ministers at about 23 per cent, while only 1.4 per cent of Remain voters said they had been listened to, according to the poll.Young people were also more likely to feel ignored than older voters, the findings show, with just 8.3 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting that they believe their voices are being heard.Around a quarter of over-65s said they felt listened to, compared to 20 per cent of those aged 55 to 64, and 10.5 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds.It comes after a special parliamentary event heard that\u0026nbspmore people back a fresh referendum than oppose one in all of the 67 most marginal Tory seats.The YouGov survey of 25,000 people\u0026nbspalso found that a majority of voters in the Labour constituencies that voted Leave in 2016 now back a fresh referendum, by an average of 59 per cent in favour compared to 41 per cent against.It also comes as more than 3,000 people were expected to attend a major rally in London to urge\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto reject a bad Brexit deal.Cross-party MPs have backed the call,\u0026nbspincluding Tory Jo Johnson, who resigned from government last week over Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, Labour’s David Lammy and SNP\u0026nbspWestminster leader Ian Blackford.Liberal Democrat MP\u0026nbspLayla Moran, who backs the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid: “No one voted for this pathetic little deal which actually hands over our sovereignty, making the UK a rule taker rather than a rule maker. It is the opposite of taking back control.”Caroline Lucas, former Green party co-leader,\u0026nbspadded: “The only solution is to take the final decision out of the hands of deadlocked politicians, away from the backroom deals, and give it back to the public with a People’s Vote.“On Brexit, it’s clear we have a parliament in stalemate that can’t deliver a clear choice for the future. So it’s time to let the British public do it instead.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It would be a huge upset if they did not sign the agreement.The Daily Mail and the  could save us from a hard BrexitThere will not be any negotiation on the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – that, as far as the EU is concerned, is settled. Many countries have said as much publicly, in the face of cabinet Brexiteers demanding a rethink.But the second part of the deal, the future relationship, is far from sealed. If anything, EU states believe their negotiators might have given away too much to Britain: some are unhappy about concessions given with little in return, and want quid pro quos like guaranteed access to British waters for their fishing fleets.If there are changes there, things could get even trickier for the prime minister at home – but these are real countries fighting for their own interests, not fantasy negotiating partners only committed to making things easy for the prime minister.None of the details for the summit are finalised yet, with an agenda set to be released later this week. We’re not sure at this point whether actual negotiation will take place at it, or whether it will just be a glorified rubber stamp. Brussels is known to favour the latter.I was on holiday during the Brexit chaos – what did I miss?Legally, the summit has to take place, because only the European Council – that is the 27 leaders meeting together in Brussels – can sign off the deal and make the political declaration about the future relationship.Those in Brussels and other EU capitals do not like being seen to “meddle” in British politics, precisely because they know how poorly they are perceived.They mostly stayed out of the referendum, they accepted the result, and they have mostly declined to call for a rerun or anything to that effect.But it is possible some may break the habit of a lifetime at the gathering and urge British members of parliament to back the deal. If they do not do it directly, they might apply pressure through other means – perhaps by warning of the prospect of no deal if it is voted down.This will be a difficult sell, however. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said as recently as last week that Brexit could be stopped if Britain wanted. If the deal is voted down, staying in is still an option. And there is clearly not a majority for a no-deal departure in the House of Commons.But despite conspiracy theories from both some Brexiteers and the odd\u0026nbspRemainer, everyone around the summit table will want a deal – just not necessarily at any cost.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its settlements there are considered illegal by most world powers.Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this.Israel’s plan to demolish West Bank village ‘could be war crime’“We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,” Airbnb said on its website.“Our hope is that someday sooner rather than later, a framework is put in place where the entire global community is aligned so there will be a resolution to this historic conflict and a clear path forward for everybody to follow.”Palestinians and their supporters had long lobbied Airbnb to delist the settlements. Israel strongly opposes such calls for boycotts, which it considers a biased approach to the conflict.Israeli tourism minister Yariv Levin called Airbnb’s move “the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts”.Speaking on Israel’s Channel 13 television, he said Israel was not told of the decision in advance and that it would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in US courts.Waleed Assraf, head of a Palestinian anti-settlement group run by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed Airbnb’s decision. Should other companies follow suit, he told Reuters, “this will contribute to achieving peace”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A view of the Fuego volcano eruption at sunrise, seen from El Rodeo, Escuintla, Guatemala.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity.

Your pecs, abs and arms — and thanks to Instagram, your wealth, car and clothes. Thanks to porn, it’s how long you can last at sex, how many positions you do it in, how big your penis is. Then there’s the terror she will tell all to her mates on social mediayou weren’t very good. It’s all so exhausting, I tend to stay single.”Student, , Belfast: “In relationships, I’d like to have more understanding, connection and vulnerability. Other people’s lives look better. I’m only  but I already dread dying without having felt loved.”MARKETING manager, , Liverpool: “I cant trust women any more because they keep cheating on me.

But I’m very happy to be having any sex at all.”Teacher, , Corby, Northants: “I’d like more sex, more respect, more attention, less arguing. The we’s told me I can have that when I lose some weight and cut down on the drinking. So it’s a stalemate.”Office worker, , Cumbria: “I would like bigger arms and to tidy up my stomach a bit, plus white teeth and a strong jawline. But those things won’t happen because I’m too busy for the gym and love chocolate. Thus, I have made my peace with the fact I shall never be some Greek Adonis.”Researcher, , East Midlands: “Why is it that women expect men to Hoover, wash, cook, clean and change nappies, but when you ask them to make dinner, it turns into some sort of gender battle about sexism  Women these days would rather watch Bake Off and buy a ready meal. They’ve forgotten how to cook like their mums, while we still slave like our dads.”Marketing analyst, , Manchester: “Sometimes I look at my ripped body and think, ‘Who is this for  Do I even want to look like this ’ I’m straight but I’m always at the gym to try to beef up, which means I have no social le and spend most of my time either looking at myself in the mirror or comparing myself ­unfavourably with other, bigger men.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show. Paddy Considine, Jessica Raines and Bel Powley all performing brilliantly in BBC’s Informer.Channel ’s strangely addictive and reassuring live operations series, with Nicky Campbell.Prime-Minister-in-waiting Johnny Mercer MP breezing through Celebrity Hunted, without dear old Kay Burley to encumber him.Scotland playing olé football against the mighty Albania.And the politically incorrect brilliance of the response Chase contestant Bethan gave to Bradley Walsh’s question: “The name of what German ­company comes from the name of founder Adolf Dassler ”“Hitler.”Compiled by Graham WrayGary Neville: “Lingard has his hands in his head.”Michael Dawson: “It’s an unexpected start for Spurs because they didn’t expect that.”Trevor Bayliss: “We’ve come to Sri Lanka to play in conditions which are foreign to us.”And Paul Merson: “A poor finish from Vardy, but that’s him at his best.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but they show up on Google Earth satellite images.Study leader Professor Stephen Martin, from the University of Salford, said: These mounds were formed by a single termite species that excavated a massive network of tunnels to allow them to access dead leaves to eat safely and directly from the forest floor.The amount of soil excavated is over  cubic kilometres, equivalent to , great pyramids of Giza, and represents one of the biggest structures built by a single insect species.The scientists collected soil samples from the centres of  mounds and used dating technology to estimate their age.The results, published in the journal Current Biology, showed the mounds were between  and , years old.Termite mounds have a complex inner structure with numerous shafts and tunnels that serve as a ventilation system for underground nests.The constructions investigated by the scientists are not abandoned ancient relics.Their builders, all members of the termite species Syntermes dirus, still inhabit large colonies incorporating as many as  mounds, the study found.Prof Martin added: Its incredible that, in this day and age, you can find an unknown biological wonder of this sheer size and age still existing, with the occupants still present.Many questions about the termite colonies remain unanswered, said the researchers.For instance, attempts to explore the colonies with a fibre optic scope had failed to locate a single royal chamber housing the termite queen.The mounds were also distributed in a strangely regular way that did not appear to be driven by aggressive encounters between neighbouring colonies."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000385907645.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vape at work mps say","story":"According to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Vaping , employers should provide designated indoor vaping areas - including in the Houses of Parliament.They want vaping to be more acceptable around the workplace with proper vaping policies for businesses and public places to be put in place in a bid to tackle misunderstandings about the practice.The group believes that guidelines for reasonable vaping etiquette should be drawn up and that all outside areas should be available to vapers unless theres a legitimate safety or professional reason to stop it.APPGV chairman Mark Pawsey said that Britains current anti-vaping culture created a  impression among the public that passive vaping was as harmful as passive smoking.Indeed, this lack of understanding was very evident in Parliament itself, a place many will look to for an example.There are only two designated vaping locations, and despite being a member for eight years, I still have no idea where either of these locations are, he said.Both of the sites are outside and given the size of the Parliament Estate could be a signicant distance away from an employee or visitors location, MPs stated.It comes after council bosses in Dundee banned staff from vaping anywhere during work hours - eventheyre off the premises.While the British Heart Foundation doesnt advise non-smokers to start smoking e-cigs, Public Health England estimates that theyre  per cent less harmful than regular cigarettes - thanks to the fact that they dont create toxic tobacco smoke.Hazel Cheeseman, Director of Policy for Action on Smoking and Healthtold The Sun: “Public health organisations like ASH and PHE have long said that we need clear policies that distinguish between vaping and smoking.When organisations treat them the same, without being clear that e-cigarettes are a much less harmful alternative, it fuels public misunderstanding and makes it less likely that smokers will switch and protect their health.Whether people choose to allow vaping inside the workplace will depend on inidual circumstances.But what is crucial is that employees understand that vaping is not as harmful as smoking and any restrictions are not about health but about courtesy in the working environment.A report by PHE published in  found that e-cigs were so much less harmful than smoking, that they could pave the way for the real game changer in regards to helping prisons go smoke-free.A project to get prisons in England to implement smoke-free policies is now fully underway, with vaping playing a critical role.Prior to the project starting, around , prisoners were buying tobacco.Today, prison canteens sell over , vaping protects to , prisoners - suggesting a signicant reduction in harm.According to Public Health Matters, . per cent of adults in England smoke tobacco. In prison,  per cent of people smoke.If vaping really is  per cent safer, that could see a massive reduction in the , smoke-related deaths we see in England every year.Daniel Pryor, Head of Programmes at the Adam Smith Institute told The Sun: Britain’s businesses should make it as easy as possible for smokers to switch to e-cigs, which are at least  per cent safer than cigarettes.The latest scientic evidence shows no risks from so-called passive vaping, so letting vapers use their devices considerately indoors is a no-brainer for public health and personal freedom.Not having to pop out for a puff in the pouring rain could make the dference between someone stopping smoking using an e-cig and their quit attempt ending in failure.And stopping could make the dference between living a long and healthy le, or dying early of cancer.The New Nicotine Alliancehas welcomed the Parliamentary report, with its chair, Sarah Jakes, saying: The Parliamentary estate becoming vape-friendly would send a strong message to other employers and venue owners that vapers should be encouraged, not harassed, and would help to educate the public that vapers are simply former smokers doing something that is good for their health.There are currently . million vapers in the UK, . million of whom have quit smoking entirely using e-cigarettes.This has contributed to the rate of smoking prevalence plummeting, but many smokers are still hesitant due to misperceptions surrounding vaping.More liberal workplace policies can have the dual benefit of correcting these misperceptions while also providing a more encouraging environment for vapers to prevent relapse, as well as for smokers considering vaping instead.Back in August, MPs called for e-cigs to be made free on the NHS as a key weapon in the health services stop-smoking arsenal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450803166-e1542712329130.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fish and chip shop owner struggling to find anyone to employ says benefits system makes people workshy","story":"Frank Suhadolnik, , runs Haughton Chippy in Darlington and has never had trouble hiring staff in the past.He recently invested £, to open a second chippie in the market town but cannot find people to staff the shop.The -year-old claimed Universal Credit – the controversial new benefits system - had turned Brits “workshy”.In a letter to The Times he said: “It has to have something to do with the benefits system.“People have to be looking for work to qualy for benefits. So they turn up to our interviews to say they’ve been looking and then leave us stuck.“We’re just ordinary people trying to make a living and we just can’t get anybody to work. It’s unbelievable.”The grandfather and his we Pamela, , had been forced to cover  shts a week to keep the chippie going.He said: “My we and I are very old. We don’t mind working but we never imagined that we would have to go back to work full-time”.Frank’s son Robert, , who manages the chippie, told the Sun Online confusion around the new benefits system had made it very dficult to hire staff.He said: “Our second shop opened last week on the other side of town. Weve been recruiting for the last three months. We had around  to  applicants, some were unsuitable but for the ones we tried to arrange interviews for, only  to  per cent came in.“We organised about  interviews a day but only one or two attended.“Then when they get through the interview stage and to a trial sht, which is fully paid, they confirm they are coming on the day about pm saying they’ll be here for the .pm sht but then nobody walks through the door. It’s a bit of a mystery.“That happened for  days on the trot. It takes the wind out of your sails. It’s been a bit of a nightmare.

We’ve got seven or interview organised for tomorrow. But are these people going to attend ”Robert said uncertainty about the new benefits system - which rolls six payments into one - was frequently mentioned by applicants.He told the Sun Online: “It has been mentioned quite a lot. They don’t know how it’s going to affect them and there’s no way of knowing how it will affect them until they are in work.“If they are offered more hours in work, it might mean their council tax element gets cut, for example. That seems to be a huge concern. They don’t know where they are going to be financially and it’s a constant source of stress.”Brits going on to the new system have said it pushes them into debt as they are forced to wait at least five weeks for their first payment.Yesterday one mum said shed been forced into prostitution to make ends meet while she waited.And claimants have said they dont know what money they will be getting from week so week - with some claiming they are reluctant to get a job in case their income changes.But new DWP boss Amber Rudd has vowed to fix the problems and said she would fight the Treasury for more cash.When you first claim Universal Credit you wont be paid any money until five weeks after you submit your claim, you will then be paid monthly.So,you need help to pay your bills or cover other costs while you wait for your first Universal Credit payment, you can apply to get an advance.You can apply for an advance payment via your online universal credit account or through your Jobcentre Plus work coach.If you get Universal Credit, you may be able to apply for a budgeting advance of between £ and £ - depending on your circumstances - to help pay for emergency household costs.Again, this MUST be repaid within a year and repayments will be deducted from your monthly Universal Credit payments - or via other meansyou no longer get universal credit.If you fail to meet your responsibilities or what you’ve agreed in your claimant commitment, your Universal Credit could be stopped or reduced - this is called a sanction.You can ask for a hardship paymentyou cannot pay for rent, heating, food or hygiene needs because you got a sanction.The hardship payment is roughly  per cent of the amount you were sanctioned by in the last month.Again, you will need to pay it back through your Universal Credit payments.If you’re having financial dficulties or you’re behind on your rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an alternative payment arrangement .Depending on your circumstances, you could get an APA to:You may also be entitled to discretionary housing paymentsyour Universal Credit payment is not enough to pay your rent - but this will depend on your council, so ask.Renters and homeowners may also be entitled to housing payment.Plus,youre struggling to pay your council tax bills you may also be allowed an up to  per cent reduction.

Running hard to avoid falling over is a bad choice for a Prime Minister who’ll know privately her unpopular, chaotic plan is a far worse deal for Britain than remaining in Europe. Surrendering sovereignty to minimise economic damage is May’s cowardly compromise. A braver PM would denounce forcefully the cost-free easy Britannia bonanza fabricated by fibbers Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, then champion another referendum. The uncomfortable home truths about stockpiling medicines and food as well as troops on the streets put into perspective the Leavers’ mythical poundmillion a week saving promise on the side of a bus. Timid Theresa May doesn’t come clean because she’s afraid of insulting five Cabinet Brextremists organising against her including Michael Gove and a Liam Fox suddenly believing any deal’s better than no deal.  She might survive a no-confidence vote of Conservative MPs in the coming weeks. But May is not strong and stable. She is living to die another day and her botched plan is barely worth the name. So a sovereign Parliament gains a glorious opportunity to take back control next month. Jeremy Corbyn’s immediate task is to convince his Westminster waverers the choice isn’t May’s mess or accidentally crashing out of Europe without a leline. Tory Leaver Zac Goldsmith declaring he’d have voted Remain in place of May’s mayhem. Brexit paymaster Arron Banks said last Sunday he’d do the same. They are rats abandoning the Quitter ship.

The synthetic cannabis, accused of turning users into zombies, was covered by an Act of Parliament curbing new psychoactive substancesin . Synthetic cannabis products were also made a Class B drug a few months later. But a Home Office review of the Act says use of NPS, especially synthetic cannabis, in prisons has continued or in some cases increased. A London hospital study also found the number of patients with synthetic cannabis problems doubled from  to  a month.And the review noted that some synthetic cannabis samples in Manchester were up to  times stronger than what had previously been sold in head shops”. Overall the review found the open sale of NPS - previously known as legal highs - appears to have been largely eliminated.But it said the trade has shted underground to street dealers while  head shops have closed.Synthetic cannabinoids are no longer being sold in branded packets, and are now largely sold in clear snap bags, the review added.This may mean that users are now less aware of the substances that they are taking, which could also lead to greater harms.It added: Some areas of concern have remained or emerged since the Act, such as the supply of NPS by street dealers, the continued development of new substances, the potential displacement from NPS to other harmful substances, and continued high levels of synthetic cannabinoid use among the homeless and prison populations. There was an explosion in the popularity of NPS on the drug scene around a decade ago.  The drugs contain substances which mimic the effects of traditional illegal drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy. Ministers brought forward the legislation to crack down on NPS after they were linked to dozens of deaths. The Act came into force in May , creating a blanket ban on the production, distribution, sale and supply of psychoactive substances in the United Kingdom for human consumption. Offenders can face up to seven years in prison, while civil orders can be issued to shut down head shops and online dealers. One of the main aims of the blanket ban was to close off a loophole in the previous regime. The loophole meant new drugs appeared with a slightly altered chemical make-up almost immediately after the previous version was banned. But the review said this objective does not appear to have been achieved, pointing to indications the emergence of new NPS in the UK has not ceased.

Tory MP Steve Baker said there is “a tactical disagreement” among supporters of the hardline European Research Groupof Tory Brexiteers, over when to force a no-confidence vote in Mrs May’s leadership. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, called on supporters to submit letters to Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady on Thursday. But they have so far failed to muster the  letters needed to trigger a vote. Mr Baker, a senior figure in the ERG, said today the group was split over whether to trigger the vote now or after Mrs May loses the Commons ‘meaningful vote’ on her Brexit deal.  He said the holdouts “want to defeat the Prime Minister, and they think they’re more likely to defeat the PM after she’s lost the meaningful vote. “That’s what’s holding back quite a material number of colleagues.” “But the letters are slowly going in,” he added. “I received a call last night to say that a letter had gone in. “So obviously it’s not the case that Jacob and I’s word is not enough to sht the Conservative Party, I would have been surprisedit had been. “But everybody faces grave choices.”  Asked why the letters had not materialised at the same event, a press conference by ERG-linked group Global Britain, Mr Rees-Mogg said: Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace. We will see what letters come in due time. He added: Do  want to come with me or not  I may find that they dont or they dont do it today but when we get the meaningful vote. Thats a decision for them. Mr Rees-Mogg denied he was trying to mount a coup against Mrs May, insisting he was using the legitimate processes of party democracy. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to  , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They will vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They will vote down the dealit allows customs checks between Ulster and Britain. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. The party has confirmed theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit.OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. Askedhis attempt to unseat the PM had been exposed as a Dads Army operation, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: Ive always admired Captain Mainwaring. Mr Baker added: “Two things have happened. Colleagues have consulted their associations, I don’t know what those conversations have yielded. “But also there’s been an enormous whipping operation over the weekend, including senior members of the voluntary party talking to members of parliament about what they’re doing, so I don’t know how opinion will have changed.

David Davis, also appearing at the press conference, introduced himself as the “former, former Brexit Secretary.” He refused to answer questions during the QA on whether he had himself submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady.

A further three in  believe they need to de-stress after Christmas shopping, and  per cent like to spend more quiet time with their family. However, almost one in five are simply using up holiday days before the end of the year. John Annoh from Premier Inn said: “Over the years, Premier Inn has seen Christmas markets become increasingly popular so we wanted to reveal the ones which Brits rate the best.

The -year-old business coach plans her weeks by the hour so she knows where she has to be and what she has to be doing at every precise moment. JoJo, who started a network marketing business at the age of  and used her son Noahs nap times to grow her company, told WalesOnline that you really can have it all but it might not feel like it.  She said: Being a single mum and running a business isnt easy. Getting the work le balance is also very dficult, but it is possibleyou are very focused on what it is that you need to do to make that happen. For me, I am very careful with my time. I have to run my weeks like a tight ship. Every Sunday I sit down and plan my week to the very hour. I know exactly what Im doing at every moment. From having a part-time job aged  to working through university, and quitting the only profession shes ever known, JoJo is one determined woman. But how has she managed it all  Growing up in Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, JoJo got a good set of grades at GCSE and A-level. She worked in a bank during the holidays, as well as working as a barmaid and cleaner. She continued working as she went to study business management at University of Wales Trinity Saint David in Carmarthen. After graduating, she moved away from home at the age of . The one thing that changed things for me was when I was working in my bank job and it was , and I went for a promotion which Id worked years to get, she said. Somebody  got it instead of me, it was the moment I realised I had to stop allowing other people dictate to me how much Im worth.  I had to go out there and create success myself. As scary as it was, starting a business and building a business was the only option for me to actually create that. Within three months, JoJo quit her bank job and set up a network marketing business at the age of . Remarkably, she had replaced her full-time income within six months. Then, she found out she was pregnant. With the clock ticking before she became a mum, it just motivated her to grow her business rapidly. She worked tirelessly right up until the night her little boy was born - and ed to work just two weeks later. As the main bread-winner for her family, when her baby was eight months old she decided to start another business coaching and mentoring. Its not easy running a business and having a baby. I did it all through nap time when he was sleeping, she said She went on to earn a six-figure salary in her first year and is now an author too, all while being a very proud single mum. Working with over  clients, JoJo is a successful business coach who also runs online classes and programmes to help other female entrepreneurs grow their businesses. She hopes to help one million women build their own successful businesses by . The mum-of-one also travels the globe, attending business retreats with her mentors. Next year, JoJo is running her own retreat in Santorini, Greece. Juggling it all isnt easy, but JoJo says she makes it work. Ive built my business to a point where I can afford a nursery two days a week, she said. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are mum days and I dont do any work. Noah goes to nursery two days a week, which is great because he absolutely loves it. It gives me that time to work on my business and stop for a moment. Being a mum, its important to just step away from your role as a mother. Even though its the most rewarding and the best job that you could have in the world, we have to remember that were also important andwe want to reach all of our goals, then we need to make time for that as well. I put so much pressure on myself at the age of  to have everything all sorted when, in reality, I was still so young. As long as I was moving just a little bit, then that would be okay. Can you really have it all  I think its a decision, she said. I think that you can have it all but it might not feel like it. You can have a great business, a great relationship but some things are priorities. If anyone feels like they cant accomplish things in le, theyve just got to decide that they can make it happen. The only person that will stop you doing it is yourself.

For months people had been speculating about the designer and the style she would go for, and the big reveal was a moment many fashionistas will never forget. The Duchess of Sussex looked beautul in a pure white dress with an open bateau neckline and three-quartersleeves, designed by Clare Waight Keller, the Artistic Director of French fashion house, Givenchy.  While many adored the dress, praising Meghan for opting for something so elegant, others were left feeling a little underwhelmed by how simple it was. And it seems they werent the only ones who questioned her choice. According to the Mail on Sunday, royal sources have revealed that the Queen was surprised by the -year-olds decision to wear white down the aisle. They said: The Queen is said to have expressed surprise that Meghan, a orcee, wore quite such a white dress for her wedding.  Traditionally a white wedding dress has been seen as a symbol of purity and once a woman had married and consummated the relationship, they were no longer meant to wear white as they had lost their virginity. Meghan, who is currently expecting her first child with husband Prince Harry, has been married once before and as such the Queen may have expected her to opt for a champagne or soft pink dress for her nupitals. The former Suits star tied the knot with movie producer Trevor Engelson in  during a four-day bash in Jamaica.  The pair had been dating for seven years before they wed but their marriage lasted only two years. For this ceremony, Meghan wore a long, white, floor- gown with an encrusted silver belt embellished on to the dress. The strapless dress also featured a short v-plunge at the front.

Leeds Crown Court heard the girl later got a boyfriend. The couple then began receiving sexually-explicit messages from Fletcher and the defendant hacked into their accounts to send private photos of them to their friends. Fletcher was arrested in  and police found a large number of extreme pornographic images - featuring animals, sadism and mutilation - on his computer, reports StokeonTrent Live.  Now Fletcher is behind bars after admitting two counts of stalking, four counts of sending private photographs without consent and having extreme pornography. Judge Christopher Batty told the defendant: “You have never provided an explanation as to why you did this. But I take the view that it was born out of obsession and nothing  - your campaign caused signicant stress to two young people. You were able to stop this at any time but you did not. You are now ashamed of what you did but you only have yourself to blame. This was not a one-off matter, it was a long course of action over many months. The court heard the boy and girl were both left feeling suicidal. Matthew Harding, defending, read out a letter to the court from Fletcher in which he apologised. He told how he was disgusted with himself and revealed had lost everything.

The -year-old was unaware of the alleged creepy campaign by Basra, who is a fellow law student at the University of Dundee. Chloe claims that whenever she posted something on Instagram, Basra would copy them within hours, using the same poses, clothes and wording, reports the Daily Record. In a horrying twist, the mimicry even includes photos Chloe posted when her dad died. When Chloe and her big sister, Linzi, looked further into what was happening, they discovered hundreds of the bizarre photos.  It was claimed that Basra even copied Chloe’s Instagram tag of ChloeCowanxo with her own, HoneyBasraxo. On Monday, Linzi took to Facebook to warn others about the dangers of social media. The -year-old, from Glasgow, who posted more than  pictures to back her claims and said the police have been notied, wrote: “Don’t even know where to start with this but just want to let people know the dangers of social media.  “My sister Chloe is at Dundee university and another girl living in Dundeehas been reenacting her le on Instagram for almost  years. “This girls behaviour is to the extreme of reenacting videos of a photo album that Chloe posted of my dad who past away . “This girl doesn’t follow my sister on social media and had made a fake account.”  And she explained that while “imitation is flattering” Basra’s campaign had gone “too far, adding: “Her behaviour is not ok and I just wanted this out in the open for people to be aware of just how scary social media can be. “Imitation is flattering but this is just too far.” Linzi also claimed to have informed the police about Basra.  Friends of the two sisters also reacted to the story which began to emerge on Sunday evening. Linzi’s pal Nathan McNaughton wrote: “I cannot understand the reasoning behind this at all... It’s completely unhealthy! Like most people I’m guilty of copying someone’s style from time to time but this just isn’t the same thing! Hope your sister is okay!

He said: “The welfare of all University of Dundee students is treated with the ultimate importance. “We are aware of these claims and our Student Services team and the Dundee University Students’ Association is providing assistance to those affected.” Basra deleted her Instagram account earlier in the day and was unavailable for comment.

Featuring in any number of famous films and telly favourites, the holiday is easily on a par with Christmas for most in the USA. Families come together to share a feast centred around turkey, take in massive parades and watch American football. Lots of expat Americans living this side of the Atlantic will celebrate Thanksgiving too, but many Brits wont have a clue what exactly is being honoured. So heres everything you need to know about the festivities on this most American of holidays:  When is Thanksgiving  Without exception, Thanksgiving always falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In , thats Thursday  November. In the US, government offices, businesses and schools close on Thanksgiving Day - with many closing on the Friday after, too, giving employees a four-day weekend. What gets eaten at Thanksgiving   The traditional Thanksgiving meal revolves around turkey, stuffing and vegetables. Youll also hear Americans talking about eating yams. Yams are a starchy root vegetable grown in the Carribean. But usually when Americans talk about yams, they actually mean sweet potatoes. The meal is traditionally rounded off with a pumpkin pie. What  goes on   Many big cities hold a Thanksgiving Day parade, the most famous of which is the Macys parade in New York. The three-hour event features floats, costumes and huge helium balloons in the shape of cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat. Playing and watching American football is a long held Thanksgiving tradition. NFL and college have played over the Thanksgiving weekend practically since the games invention, and its one of the biggest days in the football calendar. Whats the history behind Thanksgiving   The celebration of Thanksgiving is, in general, a feast to give thanks for the fruits of the previous harvest. In America specically, it dates back to the s. Theres some discussion over when the first Thanksgiving was, but many think it dates back to , when the harvest was celebrated by the Pilgrims - Dutch settlers of the Plymouth Colony in whats now called Massachusetts. This feast lasted three days, and was attended by  Native Americans and  Pilgrims. It spread through the country and was celebrated on dferent days in dferent communities until, in , George Washington declared the first national Thanksgiving Day.  #cite_note-Encyclop.C.Adia_Britannica-\" rel\"nofollow\" Does everyone in the US celebrate Thanksgiving  No. Many Indigenous Americans, who were displaced by the settlers, understandably choose not to celebrate Thanksgiving. Indeed, many groups actively protest against what they see as an offensive glorication of a group of people who plundered and stole their land and brought them, among other delights, syphilis. How does Thanksgiving relate to Black Friday  The years most terrying shopping day, Black Friday started in the US and always falls on the day after Thankgiving. Many states in the US have Thankgiving and the day after as public holidays, so people have a lot of spare time after the festivities and nothing to do but shop. Traditionally it marked the start of the Christmas shopping season, and many stores open early and put on big sales. In recent years, the Monday after Black Friday has become known as Cyber Monday - the busiest online shopping day of the year. Like Black Friday, many online retailers have sales on.  When might I have seen Thanksgiving on screen  Many Brits idea of Thanksgiving comes from the annual holiday episodes of Friends. They were some of the classic sitcoms best loved episodes. Youll remember Chandler boycotting the holiday because it reminded him of his parents orce and the time when a Macys parade balloon escaped and the cartoon character Underdog flew away - leading to the gang being locked out of Monicas apartment while the turkey burned. But the best screen representation of Thanksgiving has to be the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles, starring Steve Martin and John Candy. Its the story of two strangers who instantly hate each other, but are forced to work together to navigate holiday transport madness to get home for the weekend. Often misremembered as a Christmas film due to the snowy backdrop, its not only hilarious, but gives you a great sense of how chaotic Thanksgiving weekend can be.

The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn’t right.  There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby looked like a pig, with a mix of human. The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: We were shocked. We cant explain how it looks like that. “All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look. Sadly, the two infants and the mother goat all died, sparking fears that the creature was a cursed mutant devil that brought bad luck.  Josephine added: Nobody knows what it is, but its not a goat.

Dr Agapita Salces of the Institute of Animal Science of the University of the Philippines said the foetus appeared to have suffered a genetic mutation in the womb.

Suggestions were made to implement further speed-reducing measures along this stretch of Hebrides Drive to mitigate the problem.“The introduction of two new raised tables and narrowing of the Hebrides Drive junction at the north-west of site A has been included in the proposals.“Overall, the response was positive and group members have been in favour of the tabled design and the development in principle.“The need for new homes on this site was universally uncontroversial and the public was broadly supportive of the designs of the inidual house types.“The consultation boards were left in the Community Lounge for a week following the event to give all residents the chance to review the proposals and make further comments.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee bars may close as companies face liquidation","story":"The companies behind two popular city venues are facing liquidation.A winding-up order has been issued by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customsfor the parent firms of The D’Arcy Thompson and the West House on West Port.It is still business as usual for both premises but a petition for the liquidation of The D’Arcy Thompson Dundee Ltd and West House Dundee Ltd has been presented at Dundee Sherf Court.The well-known bars and restaurants are listed as being run by directors Jake Zakrzewski and Andrew “Macky” McMahon under the Bon Viveur Group Ltd.Companies House does not list either Mr Zakrzewski or Mr McMahon as directors of Bon Viveur Group Ltd, with the sole director listed as Helen McMahon.The winding-up notice for The D’Arcy Thompson Dundee Ltd states: “On October  , a petition was presented to Dundee Sherf Court by the Advocate General for Scotland for and on behalf of the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs craving the court inter alia to order that D’Arcy Thompson Dundee Ltd be wound up by the court and to appoint the liquidator.”As well as The D’Arcy Thompson and the West House, the Bon Viveur Group also owns The Tinsmith and Gallery , both of which are also based on West Port.The company opened cocktail bar Tom’s in the same area earlier this year.All of the ventures have opened within the last five years with the Bon Viveur Group claiming its premises “are recognised for leading the way in style, service and quality of offer”.In March, Perth Road eatery Meat House was wound up with debts of more than £,.The business, which closed suddenly in January, failed to pay HMRC and suppliers – with staff being owed almost £, in unpaid wages.The Tele attempted to contact Mr Zakrzewski, Mr McMahon and Ms McMahon for comment but they could not be reached at the time of going to press."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee cops to visit oaps in their homes ahead of christmas","story":"Police officers in Dundee are to carry out visits to elderly people in their homes in the run up to Christmas.The action will fall under the Operation After Dark programme which was rolled out last month.Community Sergeant Elise Wilson told a meeting of West End Community Council about the plans for the ward.

managers operating in the Championship right now who know better than Robbie Neilson just how powerful fans can be.As a player, he played more than two thirds of his  plus games for Hearts, whose supporters, arguably, create the best atmosphere of any club outside of the Old Firm when their team is playing in front of them at Tynecastle.And Robbie, of course, experienced more of what the Jambos fans have to offer when he successfully managed them for two-and-a-half years.Those spells in Edinburgh, in particular, taught him the backing of a passionate support can be worth points to a team.And he believes that can prove the case now he’s in charge at Dundee United.Since taking over from Csaba Laszlo at Tannadice last month, Robbie has mentioned the quality of the backing Arabs have given his rejuvenated team on several occasions.And he firmly believes they’ve more than played their part in an impressive unbeaten run of four wins and a draw that has seen the Tangerines re-emerge as serious promotion contenders from the second tier.On Tuesday night, however, it could be a case of ided loyalties for some Arabs, simply because United will be facing Alloa in a re-arranged league outing at the same time as Scotland face what could be a vital Nations League clash with Israel at Hampden.Having been blown away by the backing so far, the manager suspects it will be a case of club before country for most.“I’m definitely looking for a big turnout,” he said.“If there are any more pull-outs, my problem could be a few players might get called up for the Scotland squad!”Jokes aside, he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf2bc8421f0d.jpg ","title":"nicola sturgeon opens new major trauma centre in

services","story":"If you were in charge of the council budget, how would you balance the books and keep everyone happy  vw, px\"  That’s the question Dundee City Council is putting to locals with a new online questionnaire, Conversation with the City, which asks taxpayers to prioritise public services including housing, street cleaning and education.Participants can even choose how much more council tax they would be willing to pay, from zero to more than %.The authority insists that far from being a box-ticking exercise, the survey will be used to help shape the council’s financial priorities for the year ahead.Finance spokesman Willie Sawers said: “We’re asking about the services that people value the most.“People have to recognise that the more money they pay into the council the better level of service we can provide.“The council doesn’t set charges for the sake of it – and often the charges we levy for services don’t actually cover the cost of the service itself.“The money that comes in through charges is used to provide services, so the survey is designed to reflect the dficult decisions the council has to make in the current harsh financial climate.”In an ideal world, telling the council you want to pay as little as possible for everything would result in a cheaper tax bill.However, while the survey will be used to inform the budget, the council isn’t quite handing all the power to the people.Mr Sawers would not be drawn on the extent to which the residents’ feedback will be implemented.“How influential the survey is will depend on the response rate – we would have to balance out the income we’re spending on services with what people say,” he said.Nearly half of council tax bills goes towards children and family services such as education.About a fth goes into providing health and social care services and just under % goes into neighbourhood services such as parks and housing. More goes into council administration, road repairs and capital projects such as building schools.The distribution of those funds is not fixed, meaning Dundonians could potentially have a real say in where their money goes.Askedthe council was shying away from making its own dficult decisions, Mr Sawers said: “We want to know what people’s priorities are but we’re not asking them to decide everything.“We’re not asking people to make every last decision for us – it’s not like we’re sticking  pages of questions on this survey and asking for changes on everything we do.“And many of the people who are most reliant on our services could be less representative then others in responding to the survey. We are aware of that.”The consultation has been partly inspired by the Dundee Decides survey, where residents voted on what projects they wanted to see funded by the council’s £ million community fund.Mr Sawers said: “If you look at the turnout at council elections, it is a lot lower than UK or Scottish elections. That indicates that there’s a disconnect between people and councils.“The survey is another way for us to engage with the public and spell out our range of services, by discussing them outwith our own organisation.“Going forward in future years, we’ll be looking at the types of questions we ask too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed arsenal watched dundee prospect kerr waddell","story":"Dundee kid Kerr Waddell was watched by English Premier League giants Arsenal during the summer.And the -year-old’s progress continues to be monitored by a string of clubs from south of the border.Wednesday saw Waddell extend his loan at Championship outfit Morton until the end of the season, a move that will free him up to play in the Scottish Cup as well as league matches.Waddell made his temporary switch to Greenock, at first on a six-month deal, in early July but initially it had been pencilled in for a few weeks earlier so he could join the Ton at the start of their pre-season training programme.The loan was delayed, however, and he played in the Dark Blues opening build up game at Brechin City at the end of June, when he was watched by Gunners scouts.That was with a view to adding him to their U  squad and although the spying mission did not lead to an offer being tabled, Arsenal and others down south have been keeping tabs on his progress at Morton.New Dundee boss Jim McIntyre has also had reports on him but with good options available in defence, he’s decided the player’s development will be best served by remaining at Morton until the end of the season.Waddell broke into the first team at Dens early last season and got the goals that earned a vital win over Hearts a year past September.Injury and the arrival of experienced central defensive pair Genseric Kusunga and Steven Caulker in the early weeks of this year, saw his appearances in the second half of the campaign dry up.At Morton he’s made  appearances so far this term.The Dens gaffer has said he’s keeping an eye on all his players out on loan to see what they might add to the first-team should they be recalled in January.He said: “We send people to go and watch them so we are getting proper feedback.“Ideally, going forward I would like a position created for the loan players, somebody who keeps an eye on them so we are getting reports on each game.“The possibility is there for bringing them back but they need to be doing well where they are.”n Glen Kamara played  minutes for Finland last night in their - Nations League loss in Greece."},{"url":null,"title":"win against alloa could see dundee united eat into ayrs lead","story":"Dundee United go into today’s re-arranged Championship clash with Alloa knowing they can eat into the gap at the top of the table.The weekend saw leaders Ayr United slip up when they were held at home by Morton.It means three points for the Tangerines today will mean a deficit that stood at eight when gaffer Robbie Neilson took over last month would be down to just three.And it would leave them able to wipe out the Honest Men’s advantage when the pair meet at Tannadice next week, though they could still trail Ross County, who currently lie second.Robbie has stressed he and his players will be looking no further forward than today’s outing but already the meeting with Ayr on Friday week is shaping up to be one of the most important games of the season so far.United remain hopeful of having skipper Fraser Fyvie, centre-half Frederic Frans and full-back Callum Booth available for today.They were all stepping up their work in training over the weekend after injury problems.If they’ve suffered no reactions, they’ll be in the squad.And in the case of Frans and Booth, both of whom have missed games, the manager has admitted that would give him a nice selection headache.“They have been doing well in the team but so have the players who’ve taken over from them while they were injured,” said Robbie.The reserves are not in action this week and don’t have another competitive fixture until they’re due to face Celtic in a league game early next month.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Defending Coughtrie, of Galloway Avenue, solicitor Tony Currie said: “Slightly unusual as I don’t think either of them have a caravan. “It requested both of them to carry the item out of the shop. “This is an offence that was against a background of a chaotic lestyle and drug issues.” Mr Currie explained the pair were then caught “literally straight at the traffic lights”. Sherf John Montgomery commented the theft attempt was “rather pathetic”. Defending Thomson, of Elba Gardens in Ayr, solicitor Ian Gillies said: “Mr Thomson and Miss Coughtrie were living together but they’ve decided to part – and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. They’ve been getting themselves involved in drug-taking. “Mr Thomson could do with some support.” Sherf John Montgomery told the pair: “You both tell me that you want to change – well I can provide you with an opportunity to do that with a community payback order. “If you don’t comply with the terms of the order you’ll be brought back before me and we know what will happen.” Coughtrie and Thomson were ordered to be under supervision for  months.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCourtsPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Five primary schools in the area were ordered to raise standards by Education Scotland inspectors. They include Catrine, Logan and Drongan and Kilmarnock schools Hillhead and Mount Carmel. Four of the schools: Drongan, Logan, Catrine and Mount Carmel have seen head teacher changes since the inspections took place. Hillhead got a new school boss shortly before the Education Scotland visit. The recently recruited heads appeared before a council meeting to report on progress this week. Commenting on the shake-up of leadership in the schools, Councillor George Mair said it “seems to be head teachers disappear”. And he asked: “Is there an island they are all on ” Speaking at the council’s Governance and Scrutiny Committee last week he said the new head teachers appeared to be doing a good job. But he added: “What has been going on before  What is the problem with head teachers ”  Committee chairman Councillor Barry Douglas said: “We are not here to discuss inidual head teachers.” The council’s chief governance officer David Mitchell said there is a link between the strength and quality of leadership in schools and reports received. The meeting heard about the status at each school with the new heads giving updates to councillors. Catrine Primary and Early Childhood Centre was ordered to carry out a list of ‘requirements,’ ‘improvements’ and ‘recommendations’ in . A new head teacher, Judith Govans who was previously depute in Hurlford, was recruited to the post in June, . Ms Govans told the Committee: “To get Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Educationin was very exciting. I have had a lot of support from the local authority and my colleagues, which is appreciated.” A report presented to the meeting said: “An experienced head teacher within the local authority was re-deployed within the school.  Progress at the school is now rated satisfactory and good at the nursery. Another update on the primary from the council is due at a later date. Sean Maddocks has just become acting head of Drongan Primary and nursery. Both the school and nursery received two weak and satisfactory scores in May from Education Scotland. Mr Maddocks said: “Following the inspection in May we have a clear action plan.” A further inspection of Drongan will take place at a later date Logan Primary and Early Childhood Centre has made good progress since it was given a list of improvements from Education Scotland in . Head teacher Denise MacColl was appointed in  after the inspection. The meeting heard how she managed to turn around the school’s fortune quickly and there will be no more visits from inspectors.

more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Therersquos a lot of us in that situation.Councillor George Turnbull , who serves as the ruling administrationrsquos executive member for finance, replied: ldquoMy understanding is that it is one of the many items which will be coming before the council meeting towards the end of November, because I know the council have been in discussion with a private company.ldquoI think theyrsquove been looking at every facility which is still open at this present time.ldquoIn the report that is to come before the council there will be recommendations of dferent levels: some may be closed, some may be refurbished, the charging system might change, but Irsquove not been privy to the draft report.The decision to look into privatising the toilets followed a damning report put to the council in June that showed the decision to charge for using public toilets had netted just a third of the income that Scottish Borders Council had hoped for.The current p charge for using  of the councilrsquos public toilets in the Borders was agreed by a full council meeting in February, following a report in which officers assured members that charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the report put to councillors in June estimated that the total yearly income would be just pound,.That analysis, put forth by neighbourhood services manager Jason Hedley, relied on anecdotal evidence to explain the shortcomings in income generation.He wrote: ldquoWhat is apparent from financial monitoring is that revenue income received to date is signicantly less than the estimated levels that were forecast.ldquoA revised full year of income of pound, is now being estimated, a shortfall of some pound, which in turn was expected to also cover the cost of the implementation of comfort schemes.ldquoA signicant body of anecdotal evidence around payment avoidance has been received and observed, including from elected members.ldquoThis centres around tailgating , the lsquogood Samaritanrsquo , families paying one fee for multiple usage or antisocial behaviour, where people vandalise doors or wedge them open, allowing free access to all.A full meeting of Scottish Borders Council will be held on Thursday, November , when councillors are expected to receive a report on the procurement exercise and receive recommendations from council officers on the next course of action for the regionrsquos public toilets."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-community-action-team-do-in-the-borders","story":"THE regionrsquos Community Action Teamhas released its second quarterly report, providing a snapshot of the teamrsquos performance over a six month period.The CAT was launched in April as a collaboration between Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland as a way to tackle anti-social behaviour and drug related crime in the Borders.The team is funded via a pound, grant from Scottish Borders Council, and tackles community priorities by fining offending motorists, carrying out high-visibility foot patrols and conducting drug searches of people and properties.The CAT has also led visibility patrols during the common ridings and festivals season, and confiscated alcohol from young people at those events.Between April and September, the team has issued  parking tickets, which is an increase of . per cent on the same period last year, and has issued  road traffic fixed penalty notices and carried out  static roadside checks.Officers have also conducted  personal drug searches and  property searches. Although more than  per cent of property searches were successful, just . per cent of personal searches yielded drugs.The community action team has also carried out  hours of high-visibility patrols over the six month period, and conducted . hours of mobile patrols.Although tackling dog fouling is part of Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotlandrsquos wider initiatives to tackle anti-social behaviour, the team has handed out just two fixed penalty notices to dog owners.The latest quarterly report, which is due to go before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive committee on Tuesday , reads: ldquoFrom completing mobile patrols and static road checks several motorists have been charged with relevant road traffic offences with fixed penalty tickets being issued and drivers reported to court.ldquoThe community action team do take the opportunity to speak with and educate motorists regarding their driving style, their awareness of other road users and in relation to minor vehicle maintenance issues.ldquoOfficers have had positive results following engagement with young drivers in areas identied as having anti-social and or inconsiderate driving by groups.ldquoWork has also been done to enlighten cyclists using pavements in Innerleithen and engage with motorcyclists using the A at St Marys Loch.ldquoAll Borders towns have received attention in relation to dangerous and inconsiderate parking with an increase in the number of parking tickets issued this quarter.ldquoOfficers have been completing timed parking in our main streets and high streets in response to concerns raised by local businesses and residents.ldquoAlthough enforcement is important, the community action team officers do try to move vehicles on when possible and explain the parking regulations to the public.ldquoThe community action team are liaising with the local authority with regards to any signage problems or insufficient road markings.Between July and September, the community action team has also tackled local issues which have been raised by residents.Some of the issues investigated include: anti-social issues in Berwickshire anti-social behaviour, intimidation, harassment and vandalism in the Cheviot locality youth issues in the Teviot area and anti-social driving in Tweeddale."},{"url":null,"title":"annie-jr-a-sensational-show-thats-hard-to-knock","story":"REVIEWAnnie JrBy Hilary ScottTHE tale of loveable orphan Annie was brought to le at Innerleithenrsquos Memorial Hall last week, with a debut performance by the talented proteges of the townrsquos youth opera, who delivered the award-winning musical in sensational style.When I was a little girl, I fell in love with the classic  story of feisty, freckly redheaded Annie, who sings her way through a hard knock le at the orphanage run by child-loathing Miss Hannigan, going from rags to riches and capturing the heart of billionaire Mr Warbucks.And bringing this classic to the stage was the Kids Innerleithen Youth Theatrewho, with three sell-out performances, won over the audiences with their charming adaptation of the Broadway musical.A fan of theatre, it has become a family tradition to don our Christmas jumpers and kick off the festive season at the Kingrsquos Theatre panto in December. Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

reporters at a Westminster news conference.ldquoYou find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.His warning came as Downing Street confirmed Mrs May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Wednesday ahead of a special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.Last week senior ERG figures were confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership.But with Brexiteers apparently ided over whether it was the right time to mount a challenge, the prospect of them achieving their target appeared to be dwindling.However, Mr Rees-Mogg warned that they needed to consider whether they really wanted to carry on with her at the helm.While party rules would permit a fresh challenge in a yearrsquos timethere was a failed attempt now, he said that in practice it was doubtful that would happen.ldquoBasically,there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year, he said.ldquoGetting the  letters has shown to be quite dficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point, I donrsquot think that is realistic.Askedhis attempt to unseat the Prime Minister had been exposed as a ldquoDadrsquos Army operation, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ldquoIrsquove always admired Captain Mainwaring.Senior ministers sought to rally round Mrs May, with Justice Secretary David Gauke warning that any move to oust her would be ldquodangerous for the country.He told BBC Breakfast: ldquoThe idea that at this point, in the middle of a very delicate negotiation, that is hugely important to the future of this country, that we should remove the Prime Minister, essentially leave us leaderless, for certainly several weeks, possibly months, would be hugely irresponsible.ldquoI donrsquot think people should be talking about removing her at this point.I think that would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.The latest threat to Mrs May followed a shot across the bows from the DUP, who prop up her minority Government in the Commons.On Monday night the party joined Labour in voting against the Government on a Budget measure while abstaining in two other isions in apparent breach of their ldquoconfidence and supply agreement.The partyrsquos Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the move was intended to send a ldquopolitical message to the Prime Minister after she breached a ldquofundamental assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.ldquoWe had to do something to show our displeasure, he told the BBC.In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs Mayrsquos Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid will vote against the withdrawal deal at the summit on SundayGibraltarrsquos future is not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draftBrexitdeal puts Northern Ireland in a ldquofantastic position for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the Prime Minister claimed the regionrsquos constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border ldquobackstop and

Oliver looks way younger than  years on this planet would suggest, and is relaxed, yet on the clock, given one of his brood has to picked up from school in an hour.He certainly has the energy to undertake a tour of the great theatre halls of the land with his new show, telling of the British Isles in  Places, Glasgow this week which expands upon the detail in his new book of the same title. But his is all new to him  ldquoIrsquove spoken in public before, at literary festivals, but not night after night, he says. ldquoI only get a couple of days off during the months and itrsquos quite intense and nerve wracking. Having said that, itrsquos a fascinating and very dferent way of seeing a country. And it makes you question the notion of what a country is. Once you interrogate this notion you realise the audience in the North East [of England], for example, is a very dferent tribe from those in the South.\"You get this throughout Scotland as well. The iety of what you find leaves you confused. At times you donrsquot know where you are.But there is a commonality, I ask. Arent we all in the same boat ndash one which seems to be sinking  He doesnrsquot think so. ldquoWersquove been through everything, from invasion to natural disaster to famine to religious fundamentalism, he says. ldquoWersquove been through civil war, wars of independence, the industrial revolution, two world wars. All of this has unfolded in the same tapestry. This is just a period in history. In a  years there will be dferent issues and a dferent set of politics.Thatrsquos a comfort. Sort of. But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier.

Indeed, this bustling port on the Isle of Lewis has a thriving arts, culture and food scene that puts many bigger mainland towns to shame.Itrsquos also a place to soak up Gaelic hospitality, history and tradition, while appreciating the ever-changing terrains of this magical, wind-swept isle.Historical HighlightsKnown as Stjoacuternavaacutegr, or ldquosteering bay in Old Norse, Stornoway was founded by the Vikings in the early th century, people have inhabited Lewis for around  years.The main street, Cromwell Street, is named for Oliver Cromwell, whose forces fought to take control of the town in .Owned by the Mackenzies of Seaforth for more than  years, Lewis was sold to Sir James Matheson for pound, in . The new laird built Lews Castle, which still overlooks the bay, as well as many of the islandrsquos roads and schools.With its sheltered harbour and strategic location, Stornoway played a key role in both world wars.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

On Saturday, the Edinburgh-based newspaper was put into administration by its then-owners, Johnston Press, alongside a slew of other UK titles.The papers had been put up for sale a few weeks ago, but no potential buyer was willing or able to cover the poundm of debt attached, which was supposed to be re-paid next year.For a while, it looked as though the end was nigh for the -year-old Scotsman, as well as the Edinburgh |Evening News, the i-paper and the Yorkshire Post, another of the oldest papers in the UK, which serves a population the size of Scotland. Scores of other loyal local titles were also at risk.Later, a statement confirmed that a new company had been formed by Johnstonrsquos bondholders which, it seems, will preserve jobs and titles in the short-term. Whether there is a medium or indeed long-term future for the business remains less clear.Like most of those who work in the close-knit Scottish newspaper industry, I felt sad and a bit angry as the events unfolded. Sad that so many good, decent colleagues would be worrying about their jobs and wondering how they would look after their families, angry that they and the readers they serve had been put in this precarious situation in the first place.Make no mistake, those of us on the inside know all too well how the newspaper industry has struggled to respond to the huge challenges of the digital age, seeing our newsrooms reduce in size and scope as consumers stopped buying print products, advertising revenues fell and shareholders continued to expect big idends.But we also know how hard and tenaciously the journalists work to give readers quality news and comment in an increasingly uncertain world, how determined we are to evolve and carry on. Those of us who work for long-established brands are very aware that the trust our readers put in us, the authority we carry, has never been more valuable or vital than now, in todayrsquos fragmented, confusing world.With this in mind, journalists from up and down the land tweeted and retweeted messages of solidarity and empathy with colleagues at the Scotsman, while public figures from across the political ide, including the First Minister, also voiced support.It was shocking and dispiriting, therefore, to see others react with joy and even glee at news of the Scotsmanrsquos struggles, rushing to link the paperrsquos constitutional stance ndash it was against independence in the  referendum - with recent misfortunes, seemingly delighted to see two centuries of national journalism go down the tubes, all because they donrsquot agree with an editorial line.Taking aside the plain nastiness of revelling in the misfortune of others, the hubris and naivety inherent in this narrative is equally depressing. Do the authors of such social media threads truly believe failure to endorse a Yes vote in  has been instrumental in bringing down a mainstay in what they insist on calling the ldquomainsteam media, as opposed to economics and or poor management  Surelyit was a simple as this, my excellent colleagues at The National would be the bestselling newspaper in Scotland They seem to believe consumers buy newspapers solely on the basis of constitutional affiliation. Irsquove got news - they donrsquot.Isnrsquot it blatantly obvious that no publication is solely about its editorial stance  Thatrsquos simply not the way journalism or journalists work. Open any paper, tabloid or broadsheet, local or national, and you will find stories on an endless stream of subjects, written by people from every background and age bracket, race, gender and political persuasions, with a staggering array of interests, contacts and areas of expertise. The folk who write and edit newspapers are not perfect by any means ndash they are human and sometimes make mistakes. But in my experience the overwhelming majority thrive on interrogation and scrutiny. Indeed, thatrsquos why they became journalists in the first place.Those who relish the thought of newspapers disappearing should be very careful what they wish for. Do they honestly want to live in a society where only their own viewpoint is reflected, where positive coverage of the party, cause or person they support - be it independence, Brexit, Nicola Sturgeon or Donald Trump ndash is all they can cope with  Thatrsquos a dangerous and self-destructive road to go down, that is already blunting critical faculties and making us unable to handle complexity.

Well you canrsquot dredge a rocky bottom, so wersquore not doing that.As MBL developed its processes to remove alginate from the seaweed, it found marine cellulose was also produced.Dr Mark Dorris, a senior research fellow and lecturer in material science at Edinburghrsquos Napier University, has been working with that to create new bioplastic materials, the starting point of which are fibres that are ,th of the width of a human hair.Wood pulp is already used to produce nanocellulose, but Dr Dorris said when kelp is used the end result is ldquobetter than any nanocellulose in the world.This raw product can be turned into bioplastics to be used in food packagingfor products such as sandwiches andready meals, but work has also beentaking place with the Ministry of Defence to develop a ldquotransparent armourthat could be used for helmet visors and body shields by police and the armed services.The nanocellulose could also be usedto develop slow release drugs for treating colon cancer, as well as to helpconserve fragile, historic documentsand artefacts.Dr Dorris said: ldquoTherersquos loads of applications for this, medical implants, meshes. This stuff, because it is made from seaweed, is biocompatible, the wood cellulose isnrsquot.But Mr Mackie said he fears plans to develop such products could be haltedMSPs vote through the legislation as it currently stands on Wednesday.He said: ldquoWe worked long and hard to develop our process, basically we have turned the whole alginate processing upside down, to get to what is unique, nobody  does it.ldquoWersquove got this brilliant raw material, we do a wee bit of magic with it.ldquoThis is the thing I am most proud of that we have done, and when I see what these guys can do it is just incredible.For Sir David, though, his concerns for kelp remain.He said: ldquoIt is perfectly possible to harvest them sustainably by removing their fronds while leaving the rest of the plant intact.ldquoBut dredging ndash or indeed any kind of harvesting that removes the whole plant ndash is a wholly short-sighted measure that risks the wholesale devastation of our kelp beds.ldquoI urge decision makers to take the necessary action to protect these vital,and globally important, habitats."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-why-this-brexit-fiasco-could-eventually-give-us-all-peace-of-mind","story":"Forty-seven years on from that revealing little moment in political history, Theresa May now faces a vote of her own in the Commons to pretty much undo all of Ted Heathrsquos work and it makes you wonder what music might be appropriate this time round. Messiaenrsquos Quartet for the End of Time perhaps. Or John Cagersquos piece for organ, As Slow as Possible, which takes  years to perform. Or maybe even Eh-Oh by the Teletubbies. Any of them might symbolise the mess wersquore in now: the disorder, the ision, the dragged-out damage.To make some sense of it all, it might be useful to remember what Edward Heath thought he had achieved in  as well as the approach he took to some of the controversies that are still with us, such as referendums. Mr Heath said in lsquo that he believed the British people would eventually see the wider benefits of the European Community, particularly peace and prosperity. ldquoI believe they will become convinced that this is where the future of modern Britain lies, he said.For a while, they did, although Ted Heath did have to fight hard to win a majority in the Commons. He also resisted the pressure to hold a referendum, which some said was the only way to avoid the claim that the Government was dragging the country into the Common Market against its will. Mr Heath took a view that now looks impossibly elitist or hugely realistic: in a parliamentary democracy, he said, it would be irresponsible to leave a decision on so critical and complex an issue to the electorate.It obviously wouldnrsquot be easy for a politician to express that kind of view now, but there are lessons for Theresa May to learn from Ted Heathrsquos experiences ndash not easy ones though. Specically, in one respect Mrs Mayneeds to do exactly the same as Ted Heath did, which is to aim for the reasonable centre of the electorate, which still exists and which supports remaining in the EU, a soft Brexit, or some pragmatic compromise.However, it now looks like she can only achieve that result , in another respect, she does exactly the opposite to Ted Heath. Heath thought referendums contradicted the principles of parliamentary democracy ndash and they do ndash but in the circumstances wersquore in, another public vote is the only way to get us away from the extremes of Brexit. In fact, a second vote may end up being one of the few redeeming features of this process by recalibrating us back to where all the good and sensible stuff happens in politics: the centre ground.It is likely to happen because of the logistics of where we are. Theresa May did not ndash and realistically could not ndash stick to her Remain principles when she took over as leader of the Conservative party, but she has achieved the best deal in the circumstances ndash some of which were unavoidable, some of which were self-inflicted.The unavoidable bit was the UKrsquos border with Ireland ndash a hard border is impossible without being a member of the customs union ndash whereas the self-inflicted bit was Mrs Mayrsquos insistence on ending the free movement of people, which ruled out membership of the single market. In this version of our world ndash part reality, part unreality created by Mrs May ndash the deal we have is the only practical option.All of that means that the next few stages in the process are pretty much inevitable. Mrs May is still trying to appease Brexiters by promising that a wonderful free trade deal is still on the horizon but unless we can reach a deal that avoids a hard border in Ireland ndash and no one has come up with one ndash then, under Mrs Mayrsquos plan, Britain will eventually enter the backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement. Realistically, the backstop is also likely to form the basis of the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU: in other words, a UK-wide customs union with Northern Ireland retaining some elements of the single market.However, we know, and Mrs May knows, that there is no majority in the Commons for that, which leaves only four options: three unlikely and one almost inevitable. The unlikely options are, first, a no-deal Brexitsecond, a re-negotiation of the deal, which the EU has already ruled out whatever Andrea Leadsom says and third, a general election, which neither Theresa May nor any other Tory PM would go for.Which leaves us with the fourth option: another referendum. Ted Heath was right to resist one when he was PM, but  years on, another public vote will soon be Mrs Mayrsquos only choice. She cannot appeal to the right-wing extremists who think the same way about Brexit as some Christian evangelists think about gay-cure therapy ndash that the facts of le can be changed by faith. In insisting on her version of Brexit, she has also ruled out support from the hardcore Remainers and the SNP.However, increating a situation where a second vote on Brexit is now the only option, Mrs May could be doing us all a favour. There is always a chance the result will be another vote for Leave, but the polls show a vote for Remain is increasingly likely. If so, that could help quieten the extremists of all kinds ndash Brexiter, Socialist, Northern Irish Unionist and Scottish Nationalist ndash and take us back to the centre of politics. A good result in a second referendum on Brexit might also achieve a little of what Edward Heath felt in Number  on the evening of th October : a sense that the world is in the right order, a feeling that we are doing whatrsquos best for Britain, and maybe even some longed-for peace of mind."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-says-her-brexit-plan-is-best-for-britains-jobs-as-she-faces-critical-week","story":"In a message to her political rivals, the Prime Minister stressed that Brexit was not an exercise in \"political theory\" but something that affected peoples lives and livelihoods.In Brussels, Michel Barnier, the European Unions chief negotiator, said the Brexit process was at a \"key moment\" and urged all sides to remain \"calm\".One of the remaining details to be resolved is how long a possible extension to the transition period - effectively keeping the UK aligned with the EU after Brexit - could last for. This is an option because, in theory, it would help avoid having to have a backstop period.Intriguingly, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, talked up the prospect, saying it had ldquooption value.There has been speculation that a one-off extension,sought when the agreed transition period expired at the end of , could last until the end of .Mrs May conspicuously did not knock the idea down but stressed she would want it to be over by the time of the next scheduled general election in June , while Mr Barnier said an extension could not be \"indefinite\" and a deadline would be decided in talks this week.However, a question hangs over whether or not extending the transition would mean putting off the day the UK took back full control of its fishing waters.At present, Britain will become an independent coastal state on Brexit Day. However, the UK Government has agreed that for the transition period the countryrsquos fishing industry will comply with the regime of the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December .Given that quotas are set in December for the following  months, any extension to the transition could mean that UK fishermen would be bound by the CFP for another year. If, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the transition might extend to December , this could mean the UK adhering to CFP rules until December  more than seven years after the  vote to leave the EU.Any extension to the transition that meant UK fishermen continuing to abide by CFP rules would be anathema to Scottish Conservatives, who have threatened to vote against Mrs Mayrsquos proposed deal,this were the case.But it has been suggested the draft withdrawal agreement ldquokicks the can down the road as it simply says on the future of fisheries that both sides would use their ldquobest endeavours to come up with what happens beyond December  with an agreed plan by July .Mr Barnier and others have flagged up the possibility of slapping tarfs on UK fishing productsthere is no guarantee of continued access for EU boats to UK waters.This morning, the PM took her Brexit message to the CBI conference as she sought to win business backing for her plans.CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the event in east London: \"It is a compromise. But it is hard-won progress.\"She said firms were already spending hundreds of millions on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.In her keynote speech, Mrs May said: \"We are not talking about political theory but the reality of peoples lives and livelihoods. Jobs depend on us getting this right.\"And what we have agreed unashamedly puts our future economic success, and the livelihoods of working families up and down this country, first.\"But Brexit-supporting businessman Roger Kendrick challenged her over her plans, which he said would restrict the ability to strike trade deals with countries outside the EU, telling Mrs May: \"Think again about the economics of the whole thing.\"The PM told him: \"The portrayal that you have given of what has been agreed is a little inaccurate,\" adding: \"It makes sense for us to continue having a good trading relationship with the European Union...but also have the freedom, which we will have, to sign those trade deals around the rest of the world.\"In Brussels, Mr Barnier updated ministers from the  remaining EU nations on the state of the Brexit process.Austrian EU minister Gernot Blumel said it was \"a painful week in European politics\" and \"we have the orce papers on the table,  years of dficult marriage are coming to an end\".Luxembourgs foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said: \"This deal that is now on the table is the best there is. There is no better deal for this crazy Brexit.\"Askedhe thought Mrs May could survive, Mr Asselborn said: \"I believe she can convince her party and perhaps a part of parliament which is not on her side, so that this deal can become reality.\"The question of Mrs Mays survival is one that the EU are watching closely as Tory rebels continued to attack her plan although there still remained doubt as to whether or not they had the  signatories needed to spark a no-confidence vote.

Some MPs who were said to have put in letters to Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, refused to confirm publicly they had done so.The message from both the PM and the EU representatives in Brussels was that there could be no unpicking of the orce deal, although work on the blueprint for the future relationship continues.Mrs May made clear the proposed withdrawal plan had been \"agreed in full\" by both sides.However, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, said: \"This deal is not what the people voted for. It will tie us to the customs union for years to come with no way out.\"But there is still time to negotiate a Canada+++ deal that delivers on the referendum.

are a blight on scenery and tourism as others hail them as a symbol of the countryrsquos progressive outlook on renewables.That argument is now set to intensy as moves are being made to almost double the size of turbines nearing the end of their lespans, according to a new report.The plans have also prompted environmental concerns as it would cause further disruption to Scotlandrsquos peatland - which most turbines are built on - damaging the soilrsquos vital carbon cutting resource.Mountaineering Scotland said the move would ldquoincrease the visual impacton Scotlandrsquos mountains and landscapes, and called for the ldquoenvironmental and aesthetic impact on the landscape to be made a ldquokey consideration.Environment Protection Scotland also said that the report, by researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, raises questions over the development of windfarm policy in Scotland.Charity spokesman John Bynorth said: ldquoScotlandrsquos peatlands have a powerful natural role to play in slowing climate change through carbon capture and everything must be done to prevent damage to this vital part of our eco-system.ldquoResearch by scientists has also found that even the lsquowakersquo from wind turbines can have an impact on air temperatures and humidity, impacting on the temperature of soil and on the surface of soil ndash so itrsquos clear that digging deeper or wider foundations in which to place bigger and more powerful windfarms will also potentially have a damaging impact on Scotlandrsquos environment.The report reveals that Scotland is home to more than , operational wind turbines, with a further , either under construction or awaiting planning permission.The majority of theseare on peatland.Renewable energy accounted for around % of the countryrsquos gross annual consumption in , up from just % in , with much of that increase attributed to onshore wind farms.The report revealed that as the turbines come to the end of their lespan, usually after around  years, they need to be upgraded or replaced via a process known as repowering.This means either disturbing the peat by regenerating existing turbine foundations or creating completely new foundations where on the site.The existing turbines would then be increased from  metres to roughly  metres to harness ldquobetter wind.Professor Susan Waldron, of the University of Glasgowrsquos School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, said that while the damage to peatland is serious, the ldquopayback time, i.e. the time it takes before the turbines become beneficial to the environment, is relatively short.Research suggests this is usually between two to three years, compared to the -year lespan of the turbine.Ms Waldron said the report wasof signicance internationally, and showed that Scotland is keen to lead the way in repowering, which has only been done on a small scale so far.ldquoWersquove completed the most comprehensive and collaborative report on repowering to date, she said, adding that it considers ldquothe ecological, hydrological, biogeochemical and carbon security impacts of the repowering process.ldquoThis shows that foundations could be re-engineered to take bigger turbines , but reusing the foundation generally requires more construction materials and disturbs the soil as much as a new foundation.She added that of the two repowering options,creating new foundations would be the most environmentally friendly as regeneration involved more materials and more disruption to the peat.Friends of the Earth Scotland said the report was a ldquohelpful contribution to the developing debate on repowering existing wind farms.Charity director Dr Richard Dixon said: ldquoScotland needs to develop our renewable energy capacitywe want to progress towards a zero carbon economy.ldquoThrough a process of engagement with stakeholders and expert analysis of the benefits arising, repowered sites can play a signicant role in the decades ahead.ldquoWith careful development on shallower peatland, the net emissions savings over the lespan of a turbine project can make a very large contribution to our collective climate action.Scottish

But her remarks appeared to point to more than just a few months.Mr Clark noted how extending the transition would be beneficial to the business community, which did not want more than one change from the current position a backstop would involve two.The PMrsquos spokesman explainedboth sides were looking at a few weeks or months to complete the trade deal, then ldquothis is a decision to be taken around June  andhellipit will be at that point in time we would seek a short extension of the implementation period as opposed to going into the backstop.Askedthis was now the PMrsquos preferred option, he replied that it would ldquovery much depend on the facts at the time but stressed the key point was none of this was expected to happen as the PM believed the future relationship would be in place by January .Askedthe conditions of any extended transition period would be dferent from the planned transition ndash such as on fishing policy - the spokesman replied: ldquoThese are all things that would have to be discussed.Last week, the issue was raised in the Commons by Cornish Conservative MP Sheryll Murray to which the PM replied: ldquoWe have not changed our position, which is that, as of December , the UK should be an independent coastal state able to negotiate the issue of access to its waters for the following year and, obviously, for thereafter. MPs noted the word ldquoshould rather than will.Mr Mundell and his  fellow Scottish Conservative MPs have written to their party leader, threatening mutinyUK fishermen remain tied to the hated CFP beyond December .ldquoWe are leaving the CFP and becoming an independent coastal state in . If the implementation period is extended, as far as Irsquom concerned that will have to remain the case, declared the Scottish Secretary. ldquoIm very clear we cant extend the period and include the CFP within that extension and I could not support that.Askedhe would therefore resignBritain remained bound by CFP rules beyond December , Mr Mundell said: ldquoIm not playing into the resign soap opera. What Im focused on is outcomes and we want the best outcome for Scotland.\"While both sides have delayed a decision on what happens on fishing rights beyond December , promising to use their ldquobest endeavours to sort it out by the summer of , France, in particular, is making clear the future UK-EU free trade agreement will depend on Britain offering access to its waters similar to current arrangements.

At the weekend in London, thousands of demonstrators carried out one of the biggest acts of mass civil disobedience in the UK in decades in an attempt to hammer into the thick skulls of our political leaders that climate change matters above all . It got little news coverage.Around  people were arrested after blocking Londonrsquos main bridges. The demonstrators ndash part of the new organisation Extinction Rebellion ndash will continue the disruption tomorrow, when activists will converge on central London. I wish they were doing the same in Glasgow or Edinburgh, because I quite fancy handcuffing myself to some railings with them.The basis of their anger and fear is not only sound and incontrovertible, but morally just. Each one of us should be acting, or at least speaking up. In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changesaid there are now just  years to avert planetary disaster. Twelve years ndash cosmologically thatrsquos the blink of an eye. Twelve years ago, Tony Blair was Prime Minister. Menzies Campbell replaced Charles Kennedy as LibDem leader. Daniel Craig debuted as Bond. Oh, and Europe was hit by a heatwave giving the UK its hottest July on record. The shape of things to come, eh Did you hear much about that IPCC report  Did newspapers clear  pages to give you every spit and cough of the findings  Did the TV news run extended reports  Did Parliament ndash any parliament ndash go into special session  We have a dozen years ndash until  ndash in which to keep global warming to a maximum of .C. If we go even a half a degree above that then drought, floods and heatwaves will mean death and poverty for millions. Coral reefs could be completely eradicated.Read more: Climate change activists block London bridgesWith the world now C warmer than pre-industrial levels, the IPCC made clear that the hurricanes, droughts and forest fires we are seeing around the world is climate change happening before our very eyes. There have even been forest fires in Lapland in the Artic circle. At .C the proportion of the worldrsquos population exposed to water shortages would be  per cent lower than at C. Food would not become as scarce with a .C rise than with a C rise. Hundreds of millions more people will be thrust into poverty with a C rise than a .C rise. Heat-related deaths would also increase, insects would lose half their natural habitat, sea-level rise would affect  million more people, marine fisheries would crash. At current rates, though, the world is possibly headed for C worth of warming.Almost  senior British academics back Extinction Rebellionrsquos campaign of civil disobedience, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has thrown his hat into the ring with them as well. These experts say that the failure of politicians to tackle climate change has broken the ldquosocial contract between government and the people. In an open letter they said it was their right to ldquobypass the Governmentrsquos inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty and to rebel to defend le itself.We live in the era of the short attention span ndash news cycles come in a blizzard, stories swirl and dissipate with the wind before they are properly told ndash and climate change is a slow-moving catastrophe. It is hard to see ndash it requires reading, thought and consideration. Climate change does not appear on TV with silly blond hair spouting about theof pound million from the EU to the NHS climate change does not endlessly bicker about independence climate change does not cause a punch-up on Twitter over trans rights or someone dressed as Hitler.Who cares about whether we are in or out of Europethe world is starting to burn  What is Scottish independence worthno-one is putting the fire out  Why should I worry about what anyone on social media saysthe people typing away will be lucky to be alive in  yearsrsquo time  Perhaps, the only national or international story that really matters apart from climate change is Donald Trump ndash as his policies, his fetishisation of coal and dirty industries, compounds global warming.Many have described events such as Brexit as ldquosuicidal or ldquoan act of national self-harm.

For while Labour grandee Peter Mandelson famously said that history would remember Mr Cameron ldquosimply as the prime minister who took us out of the EU, the legacy of another of the former member for Witneyrsquos bright ideas - austerity - shows just how unfit for office he really is.Dreamed up by Mr Cameron and fellow Bullingdon BoyGeorge Osborne - who, inexplicably, has reinvented himself as the Tory-bashing newspaper editor par excellence - austerity was announced in  as the antidote to the Labour Partyrsquos preceding ldquoage of irresponsibility. With the country brought low by unscrupulous bankers and misguided borrowers - not to mention profligate Labour politicians - the time had apparently come for us all to tighten our belts for the good of the nation.Yet while Mr Osbornersquos ldquowersquore all in this together mantra rang hollow right from the off, the extent to which austerity has ravaged the poor while allowing the rich to amble along just fine was last week laid bare in a damning report from the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Indeed, thanks to austerity measures such as the introduction of what Mr Alston termed ldquoUniversal Discredit,  million people in the UK are now living in poverty, with the poor, women, racial and ethnic minorities, children, single parents, and people with disabilities most severely affected. Not only is this shameful in a nation that boasts the worldrsquos fth largest economy but, as Mr Alston said, it is ldquopatently unjust and contrary to British values.Nor can Scotland claim the moral high ground. Though the UN report noted that we have the lowest poverty rates of any UK nation, Scottish Government figures show that the number of people living in relative poverty north of the Border has increased by  per cent since the advent of austerity, from , in   to a million in  , , of whom are children. And while the Alston report praised measures such as the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fairer Scotland Action Plan and said its nascent benefits agency is ldquoguided by the principles of dignity and social security as a human right, the author stressed that accountability has not been written into the system while no mechanism is in place to ensure the most vulnerable can access what assistance is available to them.When he announced his age of austerity David Cameron said the intention was to show that ldquofiscal responsibility can go hand in hand with a social conscience. It is about as far from a ringing endorsement as you can get that Mr Alston has found the exact opposite to be the case, with his report highlighting that ldquoBritish compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous approach apparently designed to instil discipline where it is least useful, to impose a rigid order on the lives of those least capable of coping with todayrsquos world, and elevating the goal of enforcing blind compliance over a genuine concern to improve the wellbeing of those at the lowest levels of British society. Whether or not the policy has been ldquofiscally responsible, meanwhile, remains moot.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough, Warwick University economics professor Thiemo Fetzer published a paper earlier this year that drew a direct link between austerity and Brexit, with the deep cuts to welfare from  onwards thought to be responsible for pushing many in the UKrsquos most disadvantaged communities into the arms of UKIP and the vote-Leave camp. Sold on the promise of a new dawn of Great British prosperity, those voters - like the rest of us - are now forced to live in a country so economically damaged that the Financial Times reckons the average household is pound a year worse off than it was before the vote. What that figure will be once we make our final, shambolic exit from the European Union is anyonersquos guess, though we can all rest assured that it is highly unlikely to be heading south.Given his role in getting us into this mess, the idea that Mr Cameron is our best hope for getting out of it is far-fetched in the extreme. Whether he meant to or not, our former prime minister inflicted great misery on the UK the day he declared a new age of austerity, with his Brexit gamble only serving to compound the effect.The Tory Party under Theresa May may be intent on ripping itself ndash and the country ndash apart right now, but Mr Cameron is not the answer. Austerity and Brexit are indefensible allowing him to heap yet more misery on the people of the UK would be utterly unforgivable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-proclaimers-to-play-edinburgh-castle-as-they-announce-four-special-gigs","story":"The band will play inEdinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Melrose as part of their tour in support of their new album Angry Cyclist.The band will play a big top tents at Melrose Rugby Club on June  and Inverness Bught Park on July .They will also play Edinburgh Castle for the first time in a decade on July  before rounding off the-monthtour at Glasgows Hydro on September .Read more:The Proclaimers demand law change as touts sell tickets for their new tour for nearly poundThe Proclaimers, brother, Craig and Charlie Reid, said: \"We are looking forward immensely to coming home during the summer for four major Scottish shows.

That would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.\"In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs Mays Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid would vote against the withdrawal deal at a special EU summit on SundayGibraltars future was not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.ldquoIn the past  hours, none of the documents has claried something which is fundamental for us: Gibraltar is not part of the UK, declared Mr Sanchez.ldquoAs a country, we cannot assume what is going to happen in the future with regard to GibraltarhellipIt should be negotiated between Spain and the UK. As it stands, the [Spanish] government will vote against the Brexit agreement,\" insisted the socialist leader in Madrid.Meanwhile, the DUP showed its anger with Mrs Mays Brexit deal by joining with Labour to cut the Governments majority to just five in a Commons vote on the Budget.It also abstained on a series of other amendments to the Finance Bill on Monday night, in a move intended to send a \"political message\" to the PM.Their actions appeared to call into question the future of the \"confidence and supply\" arrangement by which the DUP props up Mrs Mays minority Conservative Government.Under the terms of the deal, agreed after the Tory leader lost her Commons majority in last years General Election, the Northern Ireland party is supposed to back the Government on Budget matters and on confidence votes.But Sammy Wilson, the partyrsquos Brexit spokesman, said Mrs Mays deal with Brussels breached a \"fundamental\" assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.\"We had to do something to show our displeasure,\" he declared.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draft Brexit deal puts Northern Ireland in a \"fantastic position\" for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the PM claimed the regions constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border \"backstop\" and said she \"understood and share some of the concerns that have been expressed\".But she argued the backstop was an \"acceptable insurance policy\" due to provisions in the deal.The DUP warning adds to the pressure on the PM just as the Tory bid to unseat her by Brexiteers appeared to have stuttered.Members of the Conservative European Research Group were last week confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence needed to trigger a vote in her leadership.However, there has been no announcement from Sir Graham Brady, the Chairman of the backbench  Committee, saying that they have reached that tally, while the number of MPs who have publicly declared they submitted letters remains in the twenties.There were also reports that the so-called \"pizza club\" group of Cabinet Brexiteers was backing away from a plan to go to Mrs May to demand she re-opens negotiations with Brussels on a key element of the agreement.Michael Gove - who last week turned down the job of Brexit Secretary following the resignation of Dominic Raab - Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling were all reported to be unhappy with the terms over the Northern Irish border.However, there was little sign that they were preparing to force a fresh showdown at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday, which was expected to last longer than the usual hour due to the circumstances.Elsewhere, in a further sign of the Governments weakness, ministers were forced to offer fresh concessions to stave off a damaging defeat over the publication of the Governments assessment of the economic impact of Brexit.Robert Jenrick, the Treasury Minister, told MPs they would now release a comparative analysis of the economic impactBritain was to remain in the EU rather than leave in March .Previously, the Government had only undertaken to publish its assessment of the impact of leaving with a deal, compared with a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-indyref2-may-be-after-2021","story":"The First Minister said she may not be able to overcome the UK Governmentrsquos rigid refusal to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote before .Ruling out an unofficial Catalan-style vote, she suggested the best option could be to complain vigorously about the UKrsquos action and seek a new mandate from the voters.However polls suggest the SNP will lose seats at the next Holyrood election, with Unionist parties in the majority, and so there would be no chance of a referendum after  either.The statement is likely to dismay many in the SNP, including MPs like Angus Brendan MacNeil, who called for a swt second vote at the SNP conference in October.Ms Sturgeonrsquos admission, made at a weekend meeting of the Women for Independence group, came after repeated delays to her long-awaited ldquoprecise timescale on Indyref.A new poll also gave a -point lead to No campaign.MSPs voted -

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney MSP Liam McArthur has highlighted concerns over delays in issuing flu jabs to over-s in Orkney with the Scottish Government.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Tuesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Throughout the coming winter we will monitor the agreed plan to make sure we cover any changes in weather using our existing resources to best effect.ldquoHowever, we all have a duty to take responsibility for our own personal safety which is why I encourage drivers to be aware of our gritting policy as it is simply not possible to treat every road at the same time.She added: ldquoPeople also need to be aware this year to the changes to Saturday and Sunday services.

It’s not as bad a deal as characterised. It contains many positive elements in relation to the rights of EU citizens.“Going forward, it contains this hugely important prospect for Scottish businesses for being able to trade in the EU without tarfs, without quotas - that’s the number one thing that businesses have said that they want.”Read more: Jeremy Corbyn urged to meet Nicola Sturgeon and form united front for new Brexit voteFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said SNP MPs in Westminster will vote against the deal when it is put forward in the House of Commons.Mr Mundell suggested the reasons for doing so are linked to campaigning for a second Scottish independence referendum.He said: “That’s why Nicola Sturgeon is so keen on it, that’s why she’s mandating her MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit, because she understands that the chaos and disruption that a no-deal Brexit would bring would be the best recruiting base for her independence referendum.”SNP MSP Tom Arthur suggested Mr Mundell was refusing to put Scotland’s interests ahead of the interests of his party.He said: “David Mundell makes himself look and sound more ridiculous with every day that passes.“First he indicated he would resignNorthern Ireland was given special treatment, then he reportedly voiced concerns about the proposed deal while in Cabinet and now he has admitted Theresa May’s plan will leave Scotland worse off.“But still he clings to office, without a shred of principle or credibility.“It seems there is literally nothing that can happen that would lead David Mundell to put Scotland’s interests before the Tory party’s interests.“He is quite clearly the Cabinet’s man in Scotland rather than Scotland’s man in the Cabinet - and his position is now utterly untenable.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie called Mr Mundell’s comments “unconvincing” and insisted there must be another vote on Brexit.He said: “The Scottish Secretary can’t bring himself to say the Prime Minister’s deal will make le better for people in Scotland and that’s because it won’t.“Tearing ourselves out of Europe will hit every single Scottish household.“People across the country watched the chaos of last week unfold and Conservative isions deepen.“Nobody is fooled by David Mundell’s unconvincing claim that this is the only way forward.“Those who favour a people’s vote now make up the biggest cohesive bloc in British politics.“Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding the chance to avoid a big Brexit blackhole.“Tory arrogance has taken us this far.

The responses painted a picture of a need for change and a lack of understanding of the needs of adopted children.Overwhelmingly, education has arisen as one of the main issues that adopted children are struggling with today.In Scotland,  per cent of parents feel their child’s experience of neglect or abuse in their early le has affected their schooling – and  per cent of parents feel that their children need more support.Adopted children were  per cent more likely to be excluded than their peers who had not experienced le in council care. Responses also showed that, of the adopted children who responded,  per cent had been teased or bullied because they were adopted, and that  per cent of parents felt that their children did not receive an equal chance in school.Our education system is grounded in the concept of GIRFEC – ‘Getting It Right For Every Child’. It is clear that we are not currently doing that for adopted and care-experienced children. In order to ‘get it right’, we must fully understand the needs of the children in our classrooms, and how best to respond to those needs.Adoption plays a crucial role for young people who are in the care system in Scotland. For children unable to remain with, orto, their birth family, adoption offers an opportunity for a permanent family and all that can offer a child. Adoption is a lelong process, but for families it begins with children who are at the heart of the process.The current and ongoing Independent Care Review, which is hoping to overhaul the existing care system in which the adoption process sits, has identied love as being one of the most crucial missing elements of the care system.In adoption, love is central to families. One phrase that prospective adopters may hear is that love is not enough, and any adoptive parent could tell you that loving their children will not automatically heal damage that may have occurred in their early lives.: Robert Swt: Thousands of kids are in care,  a year are adoptedAdoption is often considered to be a ‘happy ending’ for the children involved. This misconception means that the early experiences of children are not considered. It does not acknowledge the fact that more than  per cent of children who go on to be adopted have suffered abuse, neglect or trauma in their early lives.They are also living with the le-long impact of separation from their birth family, which is the unique factor that adopted children face within their group of care-experienced peers who may end up going in a dferent direction in the permanence system – adoption in the best-known form of permanence but this can also include long-term fostering and residential care.In addition to the emotional and attachment challenges faced, we are now increasingly aware of the growing number of care-experienced children who are living with the impact of drugs or alcohol while in utero. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is estimated to affect more than  per cent of children in care.It is the leading preventable cause of neurological dficulties and learning disabilities in the UK – and yet many professionals who work with children lack the knowledge and skills to adequately support them.In September this year, Adoption UK Scotland held a parliamentary event to raise awareness of our Equal Chance campaign, which is seeking a change in discourse about adopted children, and an acknowledgement of their needs in schools.: Dr Gary Clapton: Reunions after adoption can be complexThe highlight of this event was the voice of the young people themselves: five young people, from  to  years of age, spoke to a room full of professionals and policy-makers about their school experiences. They shared what worked, what didn’t – what had held them back and what had pushed them to achieve.Our Equal Chance campaign seeks and supports policy changes that will benefit our adopted young people. In Scottish schools, a child within the care system is automatically entitled to additional support and assessment of needs – the same child, who has the same history, and the same needs, loses this right as soon as the adoption order is passed.We want to support relevant government policies designed to raise attainment and emotional well-being for adopted children in school – we know that there are policies in place to better support all children, and we want to ensure that both schools and families are aware of where adopted children fit within these policies, and how they can be implemented to improve experiences for children and families. Recently the Scottish Government announced that they were giving an additional £ million pounds to local authorities to increase the remit of the Pupil Equity Fund to include care experienced children. Adopted children fit within this category, and it is crucial that parents and schools are aware of this to access the support that children are entitled to.At our event, the Minister of Children and Young People, Maree Todd MSP, commented that: “Earlier this year the Deputy First Minister announced an additional £ million over the le of this Parliament to supplement the opportunities for care experienced young people available through the Scottish Attainment Challenge. Local authorities, as Corporate Parents, should identy the ways in which the funding could be best used to improve attainment of their care experienced children and young people, including those that have been adopted.”For some children an equal chance means not necessarily being treated the same as their peers – but being offered the extra support and input that they require. The experience of adopted young people in Scotland is that they are not being given an equal chance. They have already experienced adversity and disadvantages in le, school should be the opportunity for them to reach their full potential. Not all children have an equal start in le. But we can give them an equal chance in school.Fiona Aitken is director of Adoption UK Scotland.

Scotland has been sidelined.”Andrew Marr replied: “So why don’t you have a second referendum ” Nicola Sturgeon responded: “You will have to wait for that statement – that will not be in the too distant future.”: Nicola Sturgeon: decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’So far, so unremarkable. The SNP leader’s been producing that “wait and see” line since last year’s snap general election. Even though it failed to convince when trotted out in response to Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens during First Ministers Questions last week when he pointed out that waiting for clarity over Brexit might mean waiting forever. Now maybe it’s no bad thing to have folk urging you to move a bit faster towards your constitutional destination of choice. But maybe it’s also a little weird.: Richard Leonard: Scottish independence vote would be worse than BrexitCommentators north and south of the Border assume the Scottish Government must be close to some kind of announcement on a second indyref, given the degree to which Scotland has been visibly carved out of the Brexit process, denied any whf of the dferential deals that proved possible for Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Cyprus despite Scots voting more overwhelmingly to stay in the EU. \u2028But Nicola Sturgeon and Mike Russell spent the weekend promoting another cause – urging the UK to stay in the Single Market like Norway and Iceland and remain in the Customs Union . Now of course retaining single market membership is a reasonable enough suggestion.\u2028Now of course it’s a reasonable enough suggestion. Norway joined the halfway house after two referenda rejected EU membership so they could keep their recently-won political independence but win single market access for their outward facing economy. Access to the single market is not a great solution but it’s a heck of a lot more popular in Norway than full EU membershipor leaving the single market to plough the lonely free trade furrow advocated by Britain’s hard Brexiteers. But there are cultural reasons why single market access can work for Norway but not for Britain. Firstly, the arrangement means being a “rule-taker.” That may be easier for a small country that was never a full EU member in the first place than once “mighty” Britain where the very idea of “rule-taking” prompts overwrought talk about “vassal states”. Secondly, the acceptance of less-than-perfect deals is an everyday occurrence in Norway because it’s had proportional representation since  and thus daily experience of negotiation and compromise. Westminster’s first-past-the-post system, by contrast, breeds a confrontational “no surrender” approach to international relations which would make Britain a very bad fit with the small, consensual EEA nations. Thirdly, membership of the single market means accepting freedom of movement. This doesn’t particularly bother the Norwegians, who were part of a Nordic Travel Area  years before Schengen and joined that club despite remaining outside the EU to make le and travel easier for citizens and neighbours. Sadly though, freedom of movement is a massively big deal for the millions of Britons who voted to leave the EU. So while single market membership may make sense on paper, there’s absolutely no way the closet Brexiteer Jeremy Corbyn or the Ukip-fearing Theresa Maywill ever consider single market membership because it ends the illusion that control over British borders can ever be “taken back”. So, since neither the Tories nor Labour will ever accept this halfway house, why are the SNP still pushing it  Are they virtue signalling – demonstrating that the Scottish Government can embrace a rational solution to Britain’s Brexit problems evenit cannot be stomached by No   If so, why bother It’s hard to see how much more virtue the Scottish Government can possibly accumulate over Brexit. Scottish voters not living on another planet since  are fully aware that we voted to remain, the Scottish Government published an options document a full year before Westminster, political parties here are fairly relaxed about freedom of movement and even Ruth Davidson could support single market access as long as no one from London was watching. Butthis virtuous solution has no hope of being implemented, why does the SNP spend its only moment of UK-wide media continuing to advocate solutions for the whole of the UK when that makes it almost impossible to start making the case for independence As Britain’s constitutional crisis likely deepens this week, every other party will be laying out its stall – whether that is A Peoples’ Vote, A No Deal Brexit, Theresa May’s deal, a Tory leadership challenge or a general election. But Scottish independence is nowhere to be seen. Of course, everyone accepts that naming the date for another referendum is indeed impossible with uncertainty all around. But it seems that worry about naming a date is also stopping Nicola Sturgeon from making a case – and that’s becoming problematic. Scottish voters are being plunged into a Black Friday-style sale of constitutional options and voters are thinking deeply about the future . Does the SNP believe swithering Scots will hold onto their democratic currency, ignore all the whizzy offers being laid before them and keep their powder dry till the Indy Express finally rolls into town  If it takes too long, swithering voters may have ed to the Union fold.So it’s just as well the Greens have decided to move into the unoccupied political space of the Independence movement. Yesterday, Scottish Greens co-convener Maggie Chapman wrote about the need to get updated, Brexit-framed, modern arguments for independence into the public domain as a matter of urgency. SNP MP Mhairi Black made similar points.Many Yes activists are praying the SNP leadership has got over the snap election and will start talking in detail about the independence scenario it exists to promote. If Oscar Wilde is right and the only thing worse than being talked about is indeed not being talked about, then Westminster is actually winning as an institution by being the sole focus of attention right now. Playing it safe can be laudable – but not being a player at a time like this is not an option.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832114.1542656676!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence if uk didn t exist we d invent it pamela nash","story":"Unionists will take heart from new Survation poll, but Brexit still poses a threat, writes Pamela Nash, chief executive of the Scotland in Union campaign group.As soon as the EU referendum result was announced, Nicola Sturgeon predictably used it to revive her campaign for Scotland to leave the UK.Nationalists have not stopped campaigning since, using every twist and turn in the Brexit saga in a desperate attempt to boost support for the break-up of Britain.The SNP has no interest in getting a good Brexit deal or even stopping Brexit – it wants chaos in the hope that Remain voters will swing behind independence in the belief that Scotland could easily stay in the EU. It’s a cynical tactic that EU Remain voters must always remember: don’t let Nicola Sturgeon use your vote to break up the UK.The new poll from Survation, published in The Scotsman today, shows that Ms Sturgeon’s strategy is backfiring.If a contest was held tomorrow,  per cent of people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK. In fact,  per cent of former Yes voters would now vote for Scotland to remain in the UK.This matches up with evidence that we hear first-hand at campaign events throughout the country.Contrary to SNP spin, there are many voters who backed the Yes campaign in  who no longer support independence.There are several reasons for their change of heart – not least the recent experience of the oil price crash, which would have exposed an independent Scotland to economic catastrophe and proved that Alex Salmond’s White Paper was a work of fiction.But Brexit – whether you support it or not – has demonstrated the intense complexities of leaving a political union.It has proved dficult – and it remains to be seenimpossible – to secure a orce deal with the EU, which in historical terms is a relatively new organisation. Just imagine what it would be like disentangling us from a -year-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.: Nicola Sturgeon: Decision on Scottish independence vote in ‘not-too-distant future’Alex Salmond’s White Paper fancully claimed a orce deal could be in place within  months. The SNP can never again peddle that lie.But more than anything, what we are hearing time and time again is that Brexit has brought home to voters just how precious being part of the UK is. The chaos of the Brexit negotiations highlights the stability and security we enjoy as part of the UK. Few voters want to be out of both the EU and the UK.If in today’s world the UK did not exist, we would need to invent it.So, it comes as little surprise thata second independence referendum was called after we leave the EU, this poll shows that voters would still choose to remain in the UK – with or without a Brexit deal in place.The wording in the poll was chosen deliberately. In , we were offered a yes no option and the no campaign won by around , votes. Ms Sturgeon insisted it was a “once-in-a-generation” referendum.But she used the  EU referendum to revive her campaign – a contest in which the Electoral Commission advised that voters should be offered a remain leave option.The independent experts came to the conclusion that a yes no option question is not the best option as it cannot be considered neutral when reflecting only one outcome in the question.Let’s be clear, there should not be a second independence referendum – it is not wanted and would damage Scotland – butthere was one, the precedent of using a remain leave question with both options in the question has now clearly been set. The Yes campaign will have to become the Leave campaign.: ‘Scottish independence case stronger after Scotland sidelined in Brexit talks’But while the poll makes for encouraging reading, those of us who believe in the UK must not be complacent.Just over a third of voters said Brexit makes them more likely to support Scotland leaving the UK. And while pro-UK parties have  per cent of support in Westminster voting intentions, it is still of concern that the SNP remains the largest single party.In recent weeks, senior Nationalist figures have floated the idea that a majority of Scottish MPs at the next election would be a mandate for independence.It’s reckless and dangerous talk, but it hasn’t been dismissed by the SNP leadership.SNP strategists know they are failing to turn most Scots towards independence, so are exploring other ways to break up the UK. Their underhand tactics cannot go unchecked.That’s why Scotland in Union will be campaigning hard in the weeks ahead to remind voters that whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.A separate Scotland would not automatically be in the EU and would face a long and painful application process, with absolutely no guarantee of entry.Like any club, there are rules which apply to new members.EU member states are expected to have a budget deficit of no more than three per cent of GDP.The latest official figures put Scotland’s deficit at a whopping . per cent – four times higher than the UK. The only way to get that down is by both hiking taxes and slashing spending on already-stretched public services such as schools and hospitals – meaning deeper, harmful austerity.All member countries must also commit to eventual membership of the euro, making any suggestion of financial independence nonsense as monetary policy would be handed to Frankfurt.Why harm our economy by leaving the UK – which is worth four times as much as our trade with the EU By remaining in the UK, families are better off by the equivalent of £,.It simply makes no sense to walk away from our oldest friends, neighbours, trading partners and allies.That’s why the majority of people in Scotland still want to remain in the United Kingdom.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4827978.1542705370!/image/image.jpg","title":"john curtice poll reveals many scottish independence voters happy in uk","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Polling expert, Sir John Curtice, examines the latest Survation poll on attitudes towards Scottish independence.What we seemingly learn from this poll is there is a body of people who would like Scotland to be independent, but who would be quite happythat could be consistent with Scotland remaining part of the UK.\u2028Even during the independence referendum, it often appeared the question that Scotland was asking itself was not just whether it wanted to be independent. Most people want Scotland to be politically independent, with a strong parliament of its own. Rather, the key question is whether or not it wishes to go so far as leaving the UK.: Poll: % of Scots would back ‘remain’ in new Scottish independence voteWe should not be surprisedthere are some people who would like Scotland to be independent, but as part of the UK – and that when we ask a dferent poll question that focuses on Scotland being in or out of the UK rather than on it becoming independent, some people give a dferent answer.Does this mean that a dferent question should be asked in any second independence referendum  It might be argued the meaning of ‘leave the UK’ in the poll is not clear enough. If we follow the precedent established in , setting the referendum question would be a decision for the Scottish Government rather than the UK government. The obvious thing for the Scottish Government to do would be to ask the exact same question as in , which was tested and approved by the Electoral Commission.The poll includes several questions about what sort of impact Brexit might have on support for independence. As has been found before,you ask people such hypothetical questions, then by the time you ask them about leaving with no deal, you get very substantial movement towards independence. In this case, what was originally a - split in favour of remaining in the UK becomes just -.But beware of hypothetical questions. They invite people to focus on a particular element and in many respects they often tell you more about what people think of the condition they are being asked to take into account rather than their view of what the question is supposed to be about.Presented with such a question, people who do not like leaving the EU will say ‘of course that means we should get out of the UK’. But whether they would actually vote that way is another matter. We should remember there were lots of poll questions before the February  European Council summit to which people responded thatDavid Cameron came back with a piece of paper and said ‘it’s all fine, I’ve got a deal,’ they would vote Remain. But the polls did not move at all when he did come back with his deal. On its own it is far from clear that leaving the EU will necessarily result in increased support for independence. What is more likely to matter is whether or not the economy goes pear-shaped as a result.In the much milder question in the poll on whether the prospect of Brexit makes you more or less likely to vote for independence, the  per cent of No voters say they are more likely to do so are almost counterbalanced by  per cent of Yes voters who say they are less likely. These numbers suggest the impact of Brexit could be relatively small.Indeed, previous polling has shown while some people who voted No in  and Remain in  have switched to Yes, they have been counterbalanced by a similar number of people who voted Yes and Leave who would now vote No.It is thus somewhat surprising that, in the poll, people were more likely to say that Brexit was the more important issue than they were to state that independence was the bigger question. However, this may reflect the fact Brexit is what everybody is talking about at the moment while independence is not in the news.In truth, most Leave voters are unlikely to swing behind independencethere is no Brexit deal. They think that leaving without a deal would be fine anyway. The group that it might help sway are some Remain voters, most of whom strongly dislike leaving without a deal.However, we probably will not know before March whether such an outcome is going to happen. A government defeat on the meaningful vote will not automatically trigger no deal. If the government has not negotiated a successful deal by  January, it has to come to the House of Commons and say what it is going to do – and most MPs are opposed to no deal.In the meantime, this poll suggests in an early general election Labour could lose five of its seven seats in Scotland.

A total of  per cent of respondents said UK membership of the EU was more important than Scotland remaining part of the UK, compared to  per cent who put the UK first and  per cent who said the two Unions were equally important.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, the campaign group that commissioned the poll, said: “This bombshell poll shows that a huge majority of Scots want to remain in the UK and are turned off by Nicola Sturgeon’s desperate attempts to use Brexit to break up Britain. Voters know that we are better off as part of the UK and it makes sense to remain with our oldest friends, neighbours and allies rather than ide us in the name of nationalism.“The Nationalists will stop at nothing until Scotland is separated from the UK. That’s why they are weaponising Brexit in the hope of boosting support for independence.“But our trade with the rest of the UK is worth four times our trade with the EU. Why put our economy and jobs at risk ”Ms Nash added: “This poll reveals how the SNP’s tactics have backfired and shows that people in Scotland would vote to remain in the UK with or without a Brexit deal in place.“However, we know the Nationalists won’t stop campaigning, so we need to continue campaigning as well to ensure the voices of the majority of Scots are heard.“Whatever your views on Brexit, independence is not the answer.”The SNP said the findings made clear that Brexit was forcing Scots to reconsider their place in the UK. “It’s clear that Brexit is drawing more and more people towards the opportunities of independence as Scotland’s interests continue to be sidelined by Westminster,” SNP depute leader Keith Brown said.“And a majority are confident that an independent Scotland could take its place at Europe’s top table.“With crucial days ahead as we hurtle towards Brexit, the SNP will continue to stand up to the Tories and fight for what’s best for Scotland’s future.”As the Scottish Government prepares to restart the campaign for independence in earnest once the Brexit deal is settled, the findings will spark a debate about what question voters should be asked in any new referendum on Scotland’s constitutional future.Polling agency Survation used a wording based on the  EU referendum, asking people how they would vote in response to the question “should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom ”In , the Edinburgh Agreement between the Scottish and UK governments that set the terms for the independence referendum gave Holyrood control over the franchise and referendum question, on the understanding that voters would be presented with a single question.David Cameron, the then-prime minister, is widely believed to have feared a two-question referendum preferred by Alex Salmond, asking voters whether they supported “devolution max” with sweeping new powers for the Scottish Parliament.The existing UK government has said it would not grant permission under the Scotland Act for a new independence referendum.Mrs May insists that voters made their choice in  and, while the Brexit process is ongoing, “now is not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. However, last week the First Minister said she would unveil plans for a new push towards independence “in the not-too-distant future”.Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results showed most Scots want “the best of both worlds”, with greater political autonomy while remaining in the UK. The Survation poll also confirmed the SNP’s continued strength, with voters set to send more Nationalist MPs to Westminster in the event of a snap election.Support for the SNP is at  per cent, up  per cent from the  general election. The two main Unionist parties would lose ground compared with the last election, with the Conservatives on  per cent, down  per cent, and Labour on  per cent, down  per cent. The Liberal Democrats would pick up one point, putting them on  per cent.Analysis by Professor Curtice suggests that result would give the SNP  MPs at Westminster, picking up five seats from Labour and two from the Conservatives. The Lib Dems would remain on four MPs. Mr Brown said: “People are continuing to put their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland.“We command a -point lead over the Tories, who are consumed by the complete and utter chaos of Brexit.“And Labour aren’t seen as a credible alternative. That’s why they’re languishing even further.“It seems this poll was commissioned by our opponents to land a political blow on the SNP, whereas it’s had the exact opposite effect.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense! Hungarian Revolution of , Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, The Bosnian War, The Kosovo War, Annexation of Crimea, The Ukraine crisis, The Russo-Georgian War and that is ignoring The Troubles in Ireland and countless terrorist attacks. We have a death toll here of tens of thousand and rising! Graham Fleming at least make a stab at historical fact occasionally.John, look at the EU command structure!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8698670.1541697964!/image/image.jpg","title":"local charities urge readers to show support for vital change the future campaign","story":"Will to Give is a group of  Northern Ireland cherished charities who have come together with one aim - to increase awareness of how important gts in wills are to the causes we all care dearly for.November  -  is Will to Give week, and local charities are asking our readers across Northern Ireland to help Change the Future for the charities you care for by leaving a gt in your willWith this in mind, Will to Give is dedicating this weekto encourage readers across the province to think about making their will and perhaps consider leaving a charitable gt to their favourite cause with their Change the Future campaign.A Will to Give spokesperson said: Every day right here in Northern Ireland lives are transformed thanks to the generosity of gts left in Wills by local people.These gts make a huge contribution to our work and typically fund le-changing research projects and services which can impact on thousands of local lives and change the future for many.Your will tells the people you leave behind, about the person you are.

It is not a reflection of politics or religion and it is not red to reflect the colour of blood.The full motion read: That this Council was disappointed to learn of the decision by Cambridge Universitys Student Union to vote down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday and therefore records its objection to this decision to ignore such a signicant event in our history.Cllr Henry continued, saying: If this is the way our young people have been taught, what hope do we have We as a nation look to our students in the hope that one day they will be our leaders in many walks of le.He also said: When the young people of Cambridge University voted overwhelmingly to de-emphasise the sacrice of the armed forces, thereby striking out any reference to the British war veterans, remembrance day and the poppy they brought untold hurt and suffering to many families who lost loved ones during the wars.What a despicable way to show gratitude to many hundreds of thousands who gave their all so as those students and indeed everyone of us can enjoy the freedom of democracy that we have today.Our freedoms cost many everything they had.It is easy to judge from a distance when you have the luxury of a safe and comfortable democracy.Cllr Henry requested that the council write to Cambridge University to: express their disgust and revulsion at the decision made by the Students Union. Speaking to second the motion, DUP Councillor Paul Reid said: The poppy is an emblem of remembrance used since .The poppy is not a political symbol, it is not a religions symbol but a reminder of those who fought for freedom.TUV Councillor Brian Collins thanked Cllrs Henry and Reid for bringing this matter to the attention of Mid and East Antrim Council.He said: This is a very emotive subject.To Cambridge Universitys Student Union, shame on you. Many a young man and women left the university and interrupted their studies to go a serve their nation, and many of them never ed to their studies.We have to remember the families. This is just disgraceful.The TUV fully support this important motion.UUP Councillor AP Wilson also supported the motion.He said: We share the disappointment with Cambridge Universitys student union.Cllr Wilson, however said he didnt think Council should get involved in: undergraduate student union politics, saying that: Sometimes there are lots of brains and not necessarily much common sense.He said that Council should do all they can to make sure remembrance was respectful and not party political.Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair was also concerned about getting involved in student politics.He said: We should reaffirm our support for Remembrance Sunday.After a recorded vote, Sinn Fein Councillors Hardy and McKeown voted against the motion while Councillor Paul Maguire, Alliance Councillor Paul Sinclair and SDLP Councillor Declan OLoan abstained from voting. Every other resent councillor voted for the motion, therefore it was carried.Speaking afterwards, DUP Councillor Beth Clyde said: I think it is a disgrace that people wont support the memory of all that have fallen.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

I opened in April this year and I currently offer specialist skincare, nails, massage and waxing.Helen turned her dream into a reality after taking part in the Go For It Programme which is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies.It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Commenting on the success of the programme, Helen said: Often it is hard to know where to start that was my experience before starting the Go For It Programme. The support and guidance offered through it helped me fine tune my business idea from concept to working reality.They helped me with practical things in the early stages like setting out a business plan and doing a detailed analysis. It was great for helping me to budget and forward plan.ldquoI would urge anyone who has ever had the idea of starting up their own business, or evenyou have just started operating your own business to apply for a place on the Go For It Programme. The skills and knowledge imparted is beyond the realms of what you could achieve on your own.Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, on behalf of Mid and East Antrim and Borough Council, added: ldquoHelen joined the Go For It Programme driven by a desire to launch her very own beauty business, driven by a passion to help women improve their skin and help them feel good about themselves.Helen undertook an intensive beauty course under tutelage of an industry expert with a clear vision and motivation to open her own salon as soon as she completed her examinations.We worked with Helen to develop a business plan, focusing on key areas such as defining her service provision, marketing and financial forecasting, as well as helping her secure commercial premises at Ballee and Harryville Community Enterprise Centre.It is great to see how Helen has progressed her business in such as short space of time, building a loyal customer base and a excellent reputation for her quality customer service and using only the very best range of products.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business call    or visit: visit www.goforitni.

Looking after the maintenance of it, the operations of it, all the visitors’ services, and the staff and all that side of things.“Anything that happens on the bridge is my responsibility and it’s my job to make sure it gets sorted out.”Trish Johnson making safety checks on the bridge.Born in Belfast, Trish grew up in Banbridge, attended St Mary’s Primary School and then Banbridge Academy where she completed her A Levels before going on to study engineering at the University of Salford, Manchester.After graduating, she says she “sort of fell into” bridge engineering and maintenance – an industry she has remained in for more than  years.Trish, who is better known to family and friends in Northern Ireland as Patricia, has been bridgemaster at Clton for the past two years. But previously she was in charge of maintenance at the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossingand before that looked after bridges and highways across Wiltshire and Avon.She is the first woman to take on the role of bridgemaster at Clton, but says she isn’t tempted to change her title to bridgemistress.An aerial view of the Clton Suspension Bridge, which spans the Avon Gorge and the River Avon.“It is a historic title so it would be unfair to try to change it. I’m happy with bridgemaster, so I wouldn’t want to try to change the course of history!”Trish manages a team of  people including bridge attendants, visitor centre staff, maintenance workers and administration staff, as well as dozens of volunteers who help out with ious projects.“I really enjoy it. It’s fantastic,” she said. “It is a real honour to be looking after such a historic asset. I’ve been in Bristol  or  years now – a long time since I left Northern Ireland – and the bridge has always been a part of my tours when family have been over, so it’s amazing that I’m actually looking after it now. and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"   and Santa getting ready for the Twilight Market in Portadown.\"  Christmas switch-on and twilight market tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“It is a big responsibility. The bridge itself is over  years old. It is one of the icons of Bristol. We get half a million visitors here every year, so it is my responsibility to make sure the bridge is well maintained, safe to use and that it is there for a long time to come.“It is a historic Grade  listed structure and there are not many historic Grade  listed structures that are still used as a transport asset. We still have four million vehicles cross the bridge every year, so it is a working asset as well as a historical and visitor attraction, so there is a lot to the job and it definitely keeps me busy.”The married mum-of-two admits to being slightly obsessed with bridges, and once even booked a weekend trip to Copenhagen just so she could visit the Öresund Bridge which runs between Denmark and Sweden.Her husband Rob, who works in finance, may not share her passion for bridges, but it seems he’s seen more than his fair share over the years.“When we go on holidays he ends up getting trailed round every bridge,” Trish smiled. “He’s getting used to the bridges by now!”Neither of Trish’s children share her love of engineering either. Her daughter Fiona, , works in marketing, while son Thomas, , is studying economics at university.She says she tried to get them into engineering, without success. But she’s adamant that more needs to be done in the UK in general to encourage young people, particularly girls, to get into science, technology, engineering and mathssubjects.“I think the UK has got the lowest percentage of female engineers in Europe and that’s a sad situation. We’ve probably got about % or less female engineers across the UK, so it is really important that we increase the number of women in engineering. “We need to increase the number of people with engineering skills full stop, but we need to tap in to that whole area of getting girls engaged and interested in engineering,” she continued.“Maths was my big thing. I am one of these geeks really. The problem solving side of things is what I really liked, and still do really, and engineering is perfect for that. There is always a problem you’ve got to sort out, and that’s what gets me out of bed in the morning.“I have done it for  years and I have had a whale of a time and really enjoyed it. It’s not just about getting your hands dirty and the mud and concrete and that side of things, there is so much more to it than that and that’s what we have to try to get across to the youngsters of today.”Trish, whose father Tommy Fee is well known in the Banbridge area for having run\u2028 fitness classes at the local college for more than four decades, has made her le in Bristol and says she has no plans at present tohome to Northern Ireland.“I get drawn back every now and then. I go back to see family and friends. But my husband and kids are here so I don’t think I’ll be moving home just yet, but who knows what we’ll do when we retire.”THE FACTS• The Clton Suspension Bridge opened in . It is a private bridge run by a trust.• The  feet long, ,-tonne structure spans the Avon Gorge and River Avon between Clton in Bristol and Leigh Woods in North Somerset.• The deck of the Grade  listed structure sits  feet above the river.• Its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was just  when he was appointed project engineer. • Brunel died in  – five years before the bridge he described as “my first love” officially opened.• Today the bridge serves as a crossing for more than four million vehicles every year.• Vehicle drivers have to pay a £ toll to cross the bridge, and the money goes towards the upkeep of the historic structure.• Trish Johnson, the first female bridgemaster, took over the role in October ."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8537099.1529312918!/image/image.jpg","title":"new park ride facility at fane valley welcomed","story":"Local Alderman Junior McCrum has welcomed the new park and ride facility being built adjacent to Fane Valley in Banbridge.

McCrum said: “This is a great addition for those people who commute to and from Belfast and we have no doubt it will be heavily used.It is important that a town like Banbridge has a facility like this on the verge of the A given it’s strategic position. This will provide a safe and easily accessible location in future.” with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre, who provided Helen with expert advice and help with

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment. Concluding the discussion, Senan White thanked Keith, Gary and Linden Foods for hosting the group. of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

Only Northern Ireland will legally be defined as part of the customs territory of the European Union. The North Antrim MLA believes this is of immense constitutional signicance, in that it transfers a part of the UK into the customs territory of another in circumstances where it cannot escape without the consent of that other, namely the EU.He said: \"Moreover, and in consequence, the EU Customs Codewill apply to Northern Ireland, but not to Great Britain. So, EU customs legislation - over which we would have no say - would apply only to Northern Ireland. EU tarfs and laws would be our lot, along with exclusion from any UK trade deals with other countries.\"In his letter to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, Mr Allister wrote: \"It seems to me that this, when read with its supplementary references, means that this leaves Northern Ireland, uniquely as a part of the UK, part of the customs territory of the EU. \"Whereas, all of the UK, until otherwise agreed, will be part of a single customs territory, only Northern Ireland will legally be defined as part of the customs territory of the EU. Is that correct \"Surely, this is of immense constitutional signicance, in that it conveys a part of the United Kingdom into the customs territory of another in circumstances where it cannot escape without the consent of that other, namely the EU.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bradley urges northern ireland businesses to speak up on agreements benefits","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP is unhappy that the deal will see Northern Ireland aligned with EU rules and remain part of the single market, with checks on some goods coming in from the UK to Northern Ireland,the Brexit backstop is implemented.The DUP has called for Theresa Mays proposals to be scrapped, despite Northern Irelands business and farming leaders broadly throwing their weight behind the deal and urging the party to back the draft plan.  Government has not honoured bargain: DUPs Wilson speaks after party abstains in Commons vote Ms McDonald claimed it was clear the DUP had got it wrong on Brexit and said its position disregarded peoples livelihoods, job prospects and the stability of the peace process. \"The DUP have got it catastrophically wrong. Theyre wrong about the draft agreement,\" she said. \"Its not perfect, but it is certainly a baseline to protect our economic interests and agreements.\"Its now very clear right across Ireland, north and south, that the key voices from business, agriculture and other sectors are coming out and facing down the very negative politics advanced by the DUP and Tory Brexiteers.\"Issuing a direct message to Mrs Foster, Ms McDonald said: \"Anyone who wishes to protect Ireland, north and south, needs to get off their Brexiteer high horse, face reality and understand that the current agreement is what Brexit looks like. If I were Arlene Foster I would wake up and smell the coffee, reassess my position and insist that the internal party wranglings within the DUP and Tory party cannot be allowed to drive any part of Ireland over the clf.\"Ms McDonald continued: \"Brexit isnt a passing phenomenon - this is for keeps - and we are still in very dangerous and choppy waters. \"All of us, irrespective of our party political persuasion, have to behave like adults. This is grown-up politics and its about protecting peoples livelihoods and jobs and the entire island of Ireland. \"So rather than adopting the reckless strategy that they have, the DUP now needs to listen to wider society and come on board with the rest of us who are absolutely determined to protect Ireland and Irish people, north and south. \"Now is the time for cool heads to ensure that the bottom lines around no hard border, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and crucially the protection of citizens rights are met. \"This is vital to protect everybody who lives and works on the island of Ireland,\" she added."},{"url":null,"title":"may to hold talks with juncker on future relations with eu","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

meeting was part of the “ongoing negotiations over the future framework” agreement with the EU.It is understood the talks are set to focus on future long-term relations between the UK and EU, rather than on the withdrawal deal that Mrs May unveiled last week.The move follows a stormy few days for Mrs May, which have seen the DUP deliver a warning shot across Government bows after accusing the Prime Minister of breaking fundamental promises on Brexit.And a number of Tory MPs are still pushing for a vote of confidence in the PM, although their attempts to topple her appear to have stalled.Justice Secretary David Gauke said a move to oust Mrs May would be “dangerous for the country”.I dont think people should be talking about removing her at this pointJustice Secretary David GaukeFacebookTwitterHe told BBC Breakfast: “The idea that at this point, in the middle of a very delicate negotiation, that is hugely important to the future of this country, that we should remove the Prime Minister, essentially leave us leaderless, for certainly several weeks, possibly months, would be hugely irresponsible.“I don’t think people should be talking about removing her at this point.“I think that would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.”In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs May’s Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez has said Madrid will vote against the withdrawal deal at a special EU summit on SundayGibraltar’s future is not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.The DUP showed its anger with Mrs May’s Brexit deal by joining with Labour to cut the Government’s majority to just five in a Commons vote on the Budget.They also abstained on a series of other amendments to the Finance Bill on Monday night, in a move intended to send a “political message” to the Prime Minister.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Their actions appeared to call into question the future of the “confidence and supply” arrangement by which the DUP props up Mrs May’s minority Conservative Government.Under the terms of the deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year’s general election, the Northern Ireland party is supposed to back the Government on Budget matters and on confidence votes.But DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said Mrs May’s deal with Brussels breached a “fundamental” assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.“We had to do something to show our displeasure,” he told the BBC.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draft Brexit deal puts Northern Ireland in a “fantastic position” for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the Prime Minister claimed the region’s constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border “backstop” and said she “understood and share some of the concerns that have been expressed”.But she said the backstop was an “acceptable insurance policy” due to provisions in the deal.The DUP warning adds to the pressure on the Prime Minister just as the Tory  bid to unseat her by Brexiteers appeared to have stuttered.Members of the Conservative European Research Group were last week confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence needed to trigger a vote in her leadership.However, there has been no announcement from the chairman of the backbench  Committee, Sir Graham Brady, that they have reached that tally, while the number of MPs who have publicly declared they submitted letters remains in the twenties.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May defended her Brexit plans at a CBI conference There were also reports that the so-called “pizza club” group of Cabinet Brexiteers was backing away from a plan to go to the Prime Minister to demand she re-opens negotiations with Brussels on a key element of the agreement.Michael Gove, who last week turned down the job of Brexit Secretary following the resignation of Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling were all reported to be unhappy with the terms over the Northern Ireland border.However, there was little sign that they were preparing to force a fresh showdown at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday.Meanwhile, in a further sign of the Government’s weakness, ministers were forced to offer fresh concessions to stave off a damaging defeat over the publication of the Government’s assessment of the economic impact of Brexit.Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick told MPs they would now release a comparative analysis of the economic impactBritain was to remain in the EU rather than leave in March .Previously, the Government had only undertaken to publish its assessment of the impact of leaving with a deal, compared with a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"64 of northern ireland people obese or overweight

It is our business to understand custom arrangements, the global SPS food safety regime and the world of compliance and regulation. Armed with all this knowledge and experience, we are well positioned to assess the merits of this deal.In this context, NIFDA has welcomed the draft withdrawal agreement and sees it as a signicant step forward. Like many other Northern Ireland business bodies, it is our considered opinion that it now provides a way to deliver a smooth exit and an orderly transition to the future relationship with Europe, bringing a degree of clarity which has been lacking for so long. Critically, it ensures we avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would have been disastrous for Northern Ireland, particularly for the agri-food sector, on which our economy is so reliant.We simply could not absorb increased customs, tarfs and regulatory costs on trade between Northern Ireland and the EU which would inevitably occur in a no-deal scenario.While we of course know too well the concerns raised by our members in this regard, we have also noted analysis by the Government itself which was recently reported by the BBC. This analysis estimated that in a no-deal scenario, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland would take the brunt of the damage, with NI goods exports falling by up to £.bn annually compared to the proposed backstop scenario. Anything close to that magnitude would clearly have major implications for business and jobs here.While we accept that this agreement may not be perfect, and further clarication on certain aspects will be required, we are firm in our belief that it is vastly preferable to a no-deal scenario. It offers us an effective insurance policy in the interim period until any new trading relationship is agreed. A UK-wide solution that avoids a hard border and allows Northern Irish firms frictionless access to markets in Britain, Republic of Ireland and the European Union could be immensely beneficial to the local economy. Importantly, it offers our members and the wider Northern Ireland economy the best chance of surviving and thriving in a post-Brexit world, which surely should be everyones aspiration.We would therefore urge all our political leaders to join with the local business community to support this deal and work together to ensure that the interests of our economy and society take priority over party politics. They should view the deal as a potential opportunity for Northern Ireland to trade freely within the UK and with all its future trading partners, as well as the EU and all its future trading partners - thereby delivering the best of both worlds. This could give Northern Ireland an unprecedented competitive advantage over other parts of the UK or EU, which could help transform our economy.If there are any concerns about constitutional issues associated with this deal, surely economic prosperity and stability of this nature offers the best opportunity for continued peace and protection of the status quo.Brian Irwin is chairman of the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association"},{"url":null,"title":"camouflaged micro moth seen for first time in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They live for around a year after spending a month as a caterpillar in May-time.The moth was seen by Dr Henry on the wall of his office at Innisfree Farm - next to Giant’s Causeway - last month. He said: “Few other insects can match moths for disguise. I only spotted it when a speck of green on a clean part of the wall caught my eye. When I took a closer I look I realised the speck was moving!  A tiny mm caterpillar was hauling its little camouflaged house up the wall.“These micro moths are normally found on a tree trunk or fence. Our office wall is the perfect spot for them as it’s shaded, north facing, and has the right lichen and algae that they feed on.“The caterpillar emerged from eggs laid by its mum earlier this year. It’s incredible to think that these moths could have travelled –assisted by the wind –  miles or more across the sea from Scotland to arrive on the Causeway Coast.”He added: “It’s hard to exactly say why it has turned up at the Causeway or for how long it’s been here. The most likely scenario is that it has been here under our noses for years. It’s just lucky I was in the right place at the right time to see it.”But it took him longer to identy the species. After looking on Butterfly Conservation Northern Ireland’s moth species list, Dr Henry sought second opinions from experts in Belfast and England.They used microscopic investigation and shared photographs to confirm its identity.Chairman of Butterfly Conservation Northern Ireland, Adam Mantell said: “It’s fantastic to have a new species of moth confirmed in Ireland, something which doesn’t happen every day. It shows that we still have much to learn about our native species and demonstrates the value of recording what we see around us.”The moths information will be put into the global database CEDaR , which helps monitor wildle. Dr Clf said: “Creatures like moths are important to track and monitor, as they are part of the ecosystem and the more we understand, the more equipped we are to help encourage healthy, sustainable environments. “As the UK’s largest conservation charity, restoring and looking after nature is at the heart of everything we do.  So this is a very exciting discovery for us and we’ll be keeping a close eye on these micro moths to ensure that they thrive in what is a new habitat for them.”For more information visit www.nationaltrust.org.uk ni.

We are not a party of no deal. However, the deal before us would irreparably damage the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. This is a seminal moment for our nation. We respect everyones right to examine the Prime Ministers draft deal, to interpret it as they see fit and to challenge our views where they feel it is appropriate. However, our position on the proposed deal is in line with what we have said both in private and in public for many weeks. This should come as no surprise to local representatives of business including agri-food.The draft agreement would establish signicant dferences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In legal terms, Annex  to the Protocol would mean Northern Ireland remaining in EU single market rules for goods, including food standards, while Great Britain is not. Economically it would mean vastly increased checks on food and agriculture products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Practically this creates new barriers for businesses, including supermarkets seeking to fill shelves across our province. Others can choose to frame it dferently but in our eyes such a solution cannot be described as anything other than a border in the Irish Sea. While this paints a picture of immediate disruption - even when UK and EU rules are aligned - the greater unknown of this plan is how that disruption could evolve and growand when the rules between sides erge. Although this deal may give certainty to trade on day one, that certainty is far from guaranteed for months and years down the line. There is no legal guarantee on preventing ergence within the UK internal market during the operation of the backstop. Commitments to best endeavours are not enough.Keeping Northern Ireland in the EUs state aid framework also raises the potential for dferences in support and incentives provided to businesses in dferent parts of the UK. Hospitality Ulster have highlighted fears that the plans could halt Northern Irelands campaign for cutting tourism VAT and abolishing air passenger duty. It is also clear that a new Joint Committee would have the power to restrict the maximum level of future support provided to farmers in Northern Ireland. The deal on the table fails to deliver the referendum result in every part of the UK. It leaves our province subject to the rulings of the European Court of Justice. It creates a democratic deficit whereby Northern Ireland would become subservient to EU legislation with zero representation. In real terms, Dublin legislators would have influence over the rules governing us while elected representatives in Belfast or London would have none. This violates the principle of consent. It also extends the role of the devolved institutions and North-South bodies and grants a Joint Committee signicant input into local affairs. This collectively amounts to a breach the Belfast Agreement. The wording of the draft withdrawal agreement also ensures that Dublin and Brussels hold an active veto on whether the backstop ceases to apply in Northern Ireland in the future. Both options - the review mechanism or extension to the transition period - fail to allow the UK to unilaterally move away from the arrangements should it wish to do so. This could leave us in an indefinite limbo and make it harder to leave the backstop than to leave the EU itself. The ability to supersede the backstop in whole or in part also expresses a danger that Great Britain may be able to leave the backstop but Northern Ireland may have to remain. We would be handcuffed to the EU with Brussels holding the keys. Thats not taking back control.We are not alone in our resolve to oppose the risks this deal presents to the Union. Departing Cabinet members hold to our view that this agreement would break up the United Kingdom. Labour has described it as a de facto border in the Irish Sea. The parliamentary debate in the coming days should not be framed as a binary choice between a bad deal or a no-deal. We believe there is widespread cross-bench support for a deal with the EU - but not this deal. We will not, as some have suggested, step back from our commitments to defend the security of the Union and protect the long-term economic interests of Northern Ireland. Ultimately neither can be guaranteed by this deal and for that reason the DUP cannot in good conscience support it.

due in .“I think it is now or the Prime Minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election,” he told reporters at a Westminster news conference.“You find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.”His warning came as Downing Street confirmed Mrs May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Wednesday ahead of a special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.Last week senior ERG figures were confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Mrs May’s leadership.But with Brexiteers apparently ided over whether it was the right time to mount a challenge, the prospect of them achieving their target appeared to be dwindling.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  However, Mr Rees-Mogg warned that they needed to consider whether they really wanted to carry on with her at the helm.While party rules would permit a fresh challenge in a year’s timethere was a failed attempt now, he said that in practice it was doubtful that would happen.“Basically,there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year,” he said.“Getting the  letters has shown to be quite dficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point, I don’t think that is realistic.”Askedhis attempt

European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday Senior ministers sought to rally round Mrs May, with Justice Secretary David Gauke warning that any move to oust her would be “dangerous for the country”.He told BBC Breakfast: “The idea that at this point, in the middle of a very delicate negotiation, that is hugely important to the future of this country, that we should remove the Prime Minister, essentially leave us leaderless, for certainly several weeks, possibly months, would be hugely irresponsible.“I don’t think people should be talking about removing her at this point. I think that would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.”The latest threat to Mrs May followed a shot across the bows from the DUP, who prop up her minority Government in the Commons.On Monday night the party joined Labour in voting against the Government on a Budget measure while abstaining in two other isions in apparent breach of their “confidence and supply” agreement.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The party’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the move was intended to send a “political message” to the Prime Minister after she breached a “fundamental” assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.“We had to do something to show our displeasure,” he told the BBC.In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs May’s Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid will vote against the withdrawal deal at the summit on SundayGibraltar’s future is not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draft Brexit deal puts Northern Ireland in a “fantastic position” for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the Prime Minister claimed the region’s constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border “backstop”

Which is also wrong,” Corden tweeted. “They technically should be called Blink one hundred and eighty two.”So, how should it be pronounced  Well, according to the band it’s only Corden’s take which is wrong.The band told BBC Radio ’s Live Lounge in  they call themselves “Blink One-eighty-two”, but that it’s okay to say “One-eight-two” as well – but never to use “Blink One-hundred-and-eighty-two” as it “just sounds wrong”.Of course, that won’t stop people pronouncing the name however they would like.I’ve always known them as Blink square root of ,— RIch WNovember , The maths checks out."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists finally reveal why wombats faeces is cubeshaped","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A team led by Patricia Yang of the Georgia Institute of Technology found that wombats can take about two weeks to digest its food, meaning faeces becomes dry and solid before it is passed. Yes, that’s what you think it is..... you think it’s #wombatpoo that is! From our own extensive collection of animal poos... pic exprNpxAX— National Poo MuseumNovember , By inflating intestines with a long balloon, the researchers found that the wombats’ intestinal walls stretch unevenly, allowing for the formation of the cube shapes.They explained that as faeces move into the final % of the intestine, it changes from a liquid-like state into solid matter. At that stage, the dung takes on the shape of separated cubes measuring about two centimetres.The team of scientists said the findings could prove useful in areas beyond the natural world, explaining the study’s use in developing new manufacturing techniques.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The study said: “In the built world, cubic structures are created by extrusion or injection moulding, but there are few examples of this feat in nature. “This study addresses the long-standing mystery of cubic scat formation and provides insight into new manufacturing techniques for non-axisymmetric structures using soft tissues.”The team presented their findings at the st Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Fluid Dynamics in Atlanta."},{"url":null,"title":"design proposals greenway muff derry go display public next week","story":"Plans for new a greenway that will facilitate a shared cycling and walking area will go on public display next week in Hollybush Primary School and Muff Community Hall.The emerging design proposals for the planned cycling and walking route that will link Derry to Muff go on display on  and  November. The two local authorities are planning to construct a greenway and cycle path to facilitate cyclists and walkers. From the route corridors published in May  and following an appraisal exercise, the chosen route is a mixture of the ‘red’ and ‘green’ route corridor options. The main route is as follows:.Quay Trail from existing greenway behind Sainsbury’s supermarket, Derry to the entrance of Foyle Hospice on the A .Entrance of Foyle Hospice along A on left-hand side towards Thornhill College .Thornhill College to Culmore village, turning right on to Culmore Point Road continuing adjacent to the River Foyle.Coney Roadpast Culmore Country Park, turning right on to Canning’s Lane in Muff .Turning right on to Kilderry Lane and continuing to the R.Connection on R back towards the Community Hall and also in the direction of the Muff Community Parkgoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn Muff, the route will also include an additional link to the village centre from further up Canning’s Lane on to Kilderry Lane, coming out at Main Street opposite Borderland.The North West Greenway Network programme manager, Jonathan Henderson said: “Almost  people attended the consultation events which were held in May and we received over  written submissions. A key outcome from the consultation process is that people are on the whole supportive of the project concept and are keen to see both local authorities construct infrastructure which encourages cycling and walking between the two locations. The rationale for the chosen route has been explained in the Stage  Preferred Route Corridor Selection Report which will be available at both events as well as online from  November.”Ronan Gallagher, Communications Manager for the project, added: “One of our key objectives is to build infrastructure that will encourage people to cycle and walk to and from their destination in Derry or Muff, but particularly between the two locations. Once completed, not only will we link Muff to Derry, but students at Thornhill College and several primary schools will be able to cycle and walk to school in a safe, segregated environment.”At both events the general public will have an opportunity to leave comments on the proposals. For those who are unable to attend, plans and a comments card will be available at www.nwgreenway. After these events, both local authorities will proceed to lodge formal planning permissions in both jurisdictions and will engage with landowners along the route to agree accommodation works. The councils are keen to liaise with residents while minimising disruption during construction.

A number of focused engagements with industry specialists, FDI executives and venture capitalists took place throughout the week in both Philadelphia and Boston as part of the Trade and Investment mission led jointly by Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council, presenting the compelling investment proposition that the Northwest City Region has to offer.Potential investors heard from leading global company DuPont, which has a longstanding commitment to the region, taking advantage of the unique combination of benefits that the Northwest region has to offer including an accessible, connected and business friendly gateway region with a compelling vision for greater international impact.Investors learned that companies and businesses are attracted by a talented and educated workforce, the value balance, the superb quality of le and the supportive business environment. Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Cllr Seamus ODomhnaill, who led the delegation along with Cllr John Boyle Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, believes that these types of engagements are essentialwe are to raise the profile of the region as an investment location. “Having these key influencers and potential investors in a room focusing on the northwest region and sharing with them our vision and ambition as well as the practical supports and assistance available to businesses in the region is vital,” he stressed. “There is no better way to build meaningful connections and relationships than face to face engagements.”Mayor John Boyle believes that: “The strength of the region is underpinned by the strong collaborative approach which sees industry, government at both central and local level, and further and higher education institutions from both sides of the border working together to fuel further economic growth and prosperity. This is something that investors value greatly in terms of facilitating ease of access to supports in the region.” Local businesses from a range of sectors across both Council areas also participated in the mission meeting with potential clients and business partners with a view to increasing sales and expanding their businesses. Derry based Bridie Mullin Irish Linen Ltd. participated in the mission and brought her eponymous label of handcrafted quality Irish line to Boston in an effort to tap into the US market.Bridie explains that the trade visit was an opportunity to build on her own research, and to visit stores and meet with potential clients gaining a deeper understanding of what exactly the customer is looking for.

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

worlds brexit","story":"The author of a report, \"Brexit at the Border\", has said that the ldquopressure is on our political parties especially those with the influence of the DUPa \"best of both worlds\" brexit is to become a reality.Dr Katy Hayward, who is a Reader of Sociology at Queens and who has  years research experience on the impact of the EU on the Irish border and peace process, was responding to an article penned by DUP leader Arlene Foster in last weekrsquos Impartial Reporter.In that article Mrs Foster laid out what the ldquobest of both worlds would be for Northern Ireland, which included full access to UK single market, full access to the EU single market, and full access to future UK and EU trade deals.Mrs Foster said that no-one has offered this ldquobest of both worlds to Northern Ireland but Dr Hayward claims that it is possible but onlythe ldquoUK remains closely aligned to the EUrsquos single market andit stays in a customs union with the EU.Dr Hayward does not see a smooth path to any such scenario however.ldquoBut, as Mrs Foster is well aware, the most vocalMPs in the Tory party want the UK to have a far more remote relationship with the EU after Brexit. If they succeed, this would automatically mean more barriers to trade with the EU, including across the Irish border, she stated.Dr Hayward agreed that the Mrs Fosterrsquos argument against any sort of backstop was ldquoperfectly reasonable as it is not ldquothe intended destination. But she still argues that it is of ldquocritical importance.. It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will be a gateway to both the EU market and the rest of the UK’s market. With a business-friendly regulatory regime, and strong representation in Westminster, it will remain an attractive place to live, invest and do business.”Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is “guaranteed, with the Belfast Agreement and the consent principle enshrined in this deal” she added.Mrs May named checked NI business organisations that have cautiously welcomed for her draft text - the CBI, FSB, IoD and Chamber of Commerce, noting that her Withdrawal Agreement will provide “the clarity and certainty that business needs” and allow them time to adjust to the new relationship, thus protecting jobs and investment.The Prime Minister also quoted the Ulster Farmer’s Union as saying that a no deal would be especially challenging for NI, albeit, the UFU had also said it was making no comment on the wider political implications.Finally, she also appealed to the authority of Chief Constable George Hamilton to sell the fruits of her labour, noting that his strong emphasis on the need for UK-EU cooperation in intelligence sharing for NI.“I welcome the progress we have made on data exchange and extradition but we need to go further,” she said. “This is one of the most crucial elements of our discussions with the EU this week.”The referendum was won on three main issues: borders, laws and money, she said.Gillen review: Public should be barred from serious sex trials Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This deal will deliver on all three.

This includes retaining the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland, and ensuring that we have access to the international talent that our economy needs.”The deal will also respect devolved law making and further underlines the reason why NI parties should cooperate to reconvene the Assembly, she said.Mrs May also rejected the pan-unionist concern - shared by some Tories, Labour MPs and leading media commentators - that the so called backstop would subject NI to more stringent EU regulation than the rest of the UK, and thereby create an ‘Irish Sea border’.The backstop is intended to avoid a hard Irish borderno wider EU-UK agreement has been reached on the issue by the time of withdrawal in , she noted.“Although it is important to restate that both sides agree that we never want to use it, and will both be legally bound to use our best endeavours to reach agreement on the future in good time, I understand and share some of the concerns that have been expressed,” she said.“I believe the following three points make this an acceptable insurance policy: first, there is the opportunity to extend the Implementation Period instead of entering the backstop second, the Government will keep regulations consistent across the whole of the UK in order to minimise any checks or controls and ensure no ergence between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and third, this is expressly temporary, with a mechanism by which it can be terminated. And of course, in this situation, Northern Ireland would benefit from frictionless access to both the EU and the rest of the UK markets.”She closed by saying she firmly believed that progress over the next few weeks can “mark the beginning of the healing process” to address ision that Brexit has caused in families and communities.“As Prime Minister, I am determined to do my job and deliver the best deal possible. It will then be time for MPs to do their job and to choose: move forward with this deal in the national interest, or go back to square one with all the chaos that would entail”try catch     .               ..

Photo: Clf Donaldson.Last week the UFU issued a cautious welcome for the deal on the basis that it gave urgently needed certainty and clarity on agricultural trade matters - however in a statement the union also said it was carefully avoiding making any comment about the wider political implications of the text.The UFU and DUP have since engaged in a public war of words on the matter, the UFU highlighting the trading benefits of the text for its members, while the DUP highlighted what it sees as the constitutional risks it poses.The statement from the four union presidents today emphasised the immediate clarity urgently needed by farm businesses.“Farmers want clarity on what the future trading relationship with Europe will be,” their statement. “We have argued for free and frictionless trade with the EU to continue, with no tarfs or non-tarf barriers. “The default of trading with the EU under WTO rules alone is unacceptable and would decimate our industry. “The draft Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food  drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.“UK farmers produce food to some of the highest production and animal welfare standards in the world.The food and farming industry continue to urge government to protect these standards and maintain the high levels of trade in agricultural goods between the UK and the EU, our largest export market.” Brexit: Sammy Wilson says UFU and business leaders are puppets of NI OfficeJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8707860.1542303769!/image/image.jpg","title":"farming","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Farming   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Farming   Farming Le Politics Crime Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Farming      UFU gives cautious welcome to Brexit agreementThe Ulster Farmers# Union says it cautiously welcomes the progress made on the UK#s withdrawal agreement from the EU and says the agreement, while not ideal, would ensure the UK avoids a no deal scenario.

Brexit, of course. I’ve had my fill. Editorial ImageMy brain is tired trying to understand all its nuances. But worse than that, it is distracting me from what is the most important time of the year – Christmas. I have always loved the run-down to Christmas. It’s a time when we begin to think of others, and shop for the loved ones around us. But Brexit has come between me and the festive season making me feel ill towards anyone raising the subject when all I want to be bothered about is what size the turkey should be this year. Politicians  Do we really care tuppence for them just now  Haven’t we seen and heard enough of them spitting venom over the ‘disaster’ ahead  Surely Brexit cannot be more important than the children in Yemen, dying daily in a ghastly war which shows no sign of abating, a war which like the one in Syria could go on for years  In the middle of the Christmas preparations we are faced with many such tragedies. But Brexit is dferent. It’s a war of bickering, a war destined to open up all our political weaknesses, a war which for the Irish and Northern Irish in particular is alarming in its bitterness and the need to settle old scores.Brexit is a drawn out battle we could have done without and I for one never imagined it would put a ‘damper’ on Christmas, a time of year when the charitable gene in us is thinking of other things and people. But politicians have hard hearts. Do they know it’s Christmas and do they care At this time each year we have Children in Need, which the UK as a whole continues to generously support. Going back much further to the s we had Band Aid, an event which really did capture the imagination thanks to the efforts of a pop star Bob Geldof Ben Lowry: Theresa May has ruthlessly but reluctantly felt she had to jettison unionism in Northern IrelandThe defeat of the EU withdrawal deal is the first imperative Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Yet, despite all our efforts children in many parts of the world continue to endure war and famine and what more can we do about it Regularly we put our hands in our purses in response to television and newspaper appeals but still it doesn’t appear to make much of a dference.Charities target us especially in the run-down to Christmas and I have no problem with that. In fact giving to charity is part of Christmas. Appeals are what we expect at this time of the year and people give generously. Our charity shops are full of beautul festive cards and gts to buy and many of us contribute in this way.But Brexit is getting in the way of all the festive spirit which can do so much good for those who need help. The politics of it all has me sapped, fed up, angry and vowing, at one stage, never to vote for a politician ever again. Did we get our fingers bitten back in the s when we signed up for the Common Market  Did we ever think when we signed then that we would end up being bossed around by a cabal of politicians speaking with foreign accents who dare us to withdraw from the ghastly behemoth they created due to our own politicians not reading the fine print or having the brains to see the problems that might arise in our attempt to extricate ourselves.Here I am in the midst of wondering what height my Christmas tree should be, distracted by the possibility that Sinn Fein could well be celebrating that their wildest dream of a united Ireland may be that bit closer come December. My mind is also distracted by the worry that the DUP, their reputation as kingmakers long gone, will be outwitted by the English politicians who really don’t give a toss about us and would gladly see us unhooked and driven into the Irish sea leaving them to become little England again.Soon I will dispatch Himself into the roof space to unearth the Christmas decorations an event I usually celebrate with a glass of my home made sloe gin. But Brexit is well and truly knocking the Christmas spirit out of me. try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

may","story":"Amid signs the attempt by Brexiteers to force a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister has stalled, Mr Rees-Mogg acknowledged they were struggling to get the support they needed.However, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Groupinsisted there was little enthusiasm among Tory MPs for Mrs May to take them into the next election, due in .ldquoI think it is now or the Prime Minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election, he told reporters at a Westminster news conference.ldquoYou find MPs privately who will say to you they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised.His warning came as Downing Street confirmed Mrs May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for talks in Brussels on Wednesday ahead of a special EU Brexit summit on Sunday.Last week senior ERG figures were confidently predicting they would get the  letters of no confidence from MPs needed to trigger a vote in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership.But with Brexiteers apparently ided over whether it was the right time to mount a challenge, the prospect of them achieving their target appeared to be dwindling.However, Mr Rees-Mogg warned that they needed to consider whether they really wanted to carry on with her at the helm.While party rules would permit a fresh challenge in a yearrsquos timethere was a failed attempt now, he said that in practice it was doubtful that would happen.ldquoBasically,there is a vote of confidence it is not just for a year, he said.ldquoGetting the  letters has shown to be quite dficult, so the idea that in a year you just repeat the process and then she would go at that point, I donrsquot think that is realistic.Askedhis attempt to unseat the Prime Minister had been exposed as a ldquoDadrsquos Army operation, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: ldquoIrsquove always admired Captain Mainwaring.Theresa May will meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday Senior ministers sought to rally round Mrs May, with Justice Secretary David Gauke warning that any move to oust her would be ldquodangerous for the country.He told BBC Breakfast: ldquoThe idea that at this point, in the middle of a very delicate negotiation, that is hugely important to the future of this country, that we should remove the Prime Minister, essentially leave us leaderless, for certainly several weeks, possibly months, would be hugely irresponsible.ldquoI donrsquot think people should be talking about removing her at this point.I think that would be self-indulgent and dangerous for the country.The latest threat to Mrs May followed a shot across the bows from the DUP, who prop up her minority Government in the Commons.On Monday night the party joined Labour in voting against the Government on a Budget measure while abstaining in two other isions in apparent breach of their ldquoconfidence and supply agreement.The partyrsquos Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the move was intended to send a ldquopolitical message to the Prime Minister after she breached a ldquofundamental assurance that Northern Ireland would not be separated constitutionally or economically from the rest of the UK.ldquoWe had to do something to show our displeasure, he told the BBC.In another cause for concern for the PM, Mrs Mayrsquos Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez said Madrid will vote against the withdrawal deal at the summit on SundayGibraltarrsquos future is not considered a bilateral issue between the UK and Spain.In a bid to sway opinion, Mrs May has insisted that her draftBrexitdeal puts Northern Ireland in a ldquofantastic position for the future.In an opinion piece published in the Belfast , the Prime Minister claimed the regionrsquos constitutional status within the UK had been guaranteed in the agreement.Mrs May acknowledged that there had been a lot of focus on the Irish border ldquobackstop and said she ldquounderstood and share some of the concerns that have been expressed.But she said the backstop was an ldquoacceptable insurance policy due to provisions in the deal..push,i[r].l*new

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

These aspirations are higher than predecessors. Harder to reach than MillennialsGen Z are incredibly tech savvy and have always lived in a world of interconnectivity. Most of Gen Z are connected for more than  hours a day. No wonder they are often referred to as the ‘always on’ generation. Unfortunately, gaining and keeping their attention is extremely challenging. Gen Z much prefer Snapchat and Instagram over Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Creators, not just consumersGen Z want to contribute, create and be part of something, they are opinionated and feel strongly that their voice should be heard.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
