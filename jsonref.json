I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a picture of me in London because when I go out in London I wear a suit and a tie. \u0027That\u0027s what I would describe as my travelling clothes if I\u0027m going to go overseas. There’s plenty of photographs of me dressed in that sort of kit but not there.\u0027                 In a November TV interview, Andrew maintained that he does not recall meeting Giuffre US Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The case brought renewed scrutiny to Epstein\u0027s many high-profile associates, including Andrew, who says he met the financier in 1999. The pair maintained their friendship even after Epstein served 13 months in a Florida county jail after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution in 2008. Andrew came under fire in 2010 after it was revealed that he stayed at Epstein\u0027s Manhattan home following his release from jail.     Asked during the November interview whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, Andrew said: \u0027Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\u0027 The BBC interviewer replied: \u0027Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u0027Andrew then apologized, saying: \u0027I\u0027m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. \u0027But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. \u0027I don\u0027t there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 Andrew was also friends with Maxwell, the British socialite accused in several civil lawsuits of recruiting girls and young women for Epstein to sexually abuse.Last week, a former police protection officer for Andrew came forward to claim that Maxwell would visit the prince at Buckingham Palace up to four times a day and that the pair would enjoy picnics together on the grounds of the estate in London. Met Police officer Paul Page, who worked for the Royals from 1998 to 2004, told The Mirror he first became aware of who Maxwell was in 2001 when the privy purse - the office that handles the Queen\u0027s private income - called to inform him that a guest was coming to see Andrew but that the name was not to be entered into the book. \u0027She turned up in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and we let her in. Half an hour after that me and my colleague walked through the garden to go back to the police lodge and he was having a picnic with her by the summer house, opposite the Queen\u0027s ­bedroom window,\u0027 Page said.\u0027One of my colleagues saw her come in and out the Palace four times in one day.\u0027 Andrew claimed in the BBC interview that he last saw Maxwell in the early spring of last year, months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.  Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein but is believed to be one of the key figures in the US government\u0027s probe. Two guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead have already been charged with falsifying the jail\u0027s log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.  Prince Andrew \u0027had visits from Ghislaine Maxwell 4 times a day\u0027 says ex-protection officer - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Kobe Bryants former pilot claims Sikorsky S 76B reliable aircraft complex","story":"Share this articleKobe Bryant Helicopter Pilot Misjudged Terrain and Didn\u0027t Slow Down, Pilots SayKobe Bryant\u0027s helicopter was like a limousine and had a strong safety record, NBA star\u0027s former pilot says - Los Angeles Times"},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE Cool Carrie Symonds lavished gifts Downing Street","story":"Share this article   Jessica’s £30 outfit saves the big day...          Jessica Mulroney with her best friend Meghan Markle         Jessica Mulroney in the dress she bought as a last-minute emergency for her pal\u0027s weddingThe Duchess of Sussex’s best friend Jessica Mulroney has a cool head in a crisis.The 40-year-old wedding planner, whose father-in-law is Canada’s former prime minister, Brian Mulroney, navigated a near-fashion disaster with aplomb at a marriage ceremony she helped to organise in Florida.The mother-of-three — whose twin sons, Brian and John, were pageboys at Meghan and Harry’s wedding in 2018 — reveals that she arrived wearing the exact same outfit as an important guest, but solved the problem by dashing out to buy a £30 alternative.Sharing a picture online of the new outfit — a figure-hugging magenta gown — she writes: ‘What happens when the mother of the groom has the same dress as you?

She said she spoke to Albert, who told her: \u0027You are not my daughter.\u0027         Delphine (pictured outside court in 2017) first          Delphine (left, with her mother in 2000) first claimed to be Albert\u0027s lovechild in 1999, after an unofficial biography of the Queen claimed he had an affair and a child born out of wedlock         Albert is thought to have started an affair with Baroness Longchamps in 1966 (pictured in 1965), before he became king but after he got marriedMs Boel claims that questions over her lineage led to her and her mother being put on a \u0027high risk\u0027 list by financial institutions, which led to Royal Bank of Scotland abruptly closing both of their bank accounts in 2012.She said her 11-year-old son was also put on the register, limiting his access to financial institutions.Ms Boel was told she would have to publicly denounce claims that Albert was her father in order to have their names removed.\u0027I refuse to sign such a lie,\u0027 she told German newspaper Die Welt. Those difficulties prompted her to go to the courts in 2013 in an attempt to prove her biological father was Albert.The same year the legal case began, Albert abdicated for \u0027health reasons\u0027, passing the throne to son Philippe - Ms Boel\u0027s half-brother. After several early setbacks, the breakthrough for Ms Boel came in November last year when a court ruled that Albert must provide a DNA sample for testing.Failure to comply would result in a €5,000 fine for each day the sample was missing.Albert is thought to have undergone the DNA test shortly afterwards, which proved he is Ms Boel\u0027s father.The royal then issued a statement on Monday confirming the paternity.          Six years ago, Ms Boel, who bears a striking resemblance to some members of the royal family, opened court proceedings to prove that Albert was her fatherLawyer Alain Berenboom then issued a statement which said: \u0027Even though there are legal arguments and objections that show that legal paternity is not necessarily a reflection of biological paternity and that the procedure followed can be disputed, King Albert has decided to put an end to this painful procedure in good conscience.\u0027Mr Yves-Henri Leleu, lawyer for Ms Boel, told MailOnline: ‘She feels good. She is very, very happy. A 20-year problem is at the point of being solved.‘Maybe she will have a party… Belgians are very big fans of champagne.’However, the lawyer says her joy at the outcome was tinged with sadness over her father’s reluctance to cooperate during her long paternity battle.‘If you carefully read the communiqué of the King you will find a lot of statements to show he is very reluctant,’ her lawyer said. ‘It is not an elegant communiqué. It is not very fair, very noble.’Ms Boël never believed she would be able to forge a relationship with King Albert, he added, and her legal action was intended purely to make peace with her heritage.‘It is not a question of having a father like when you are a little child,’ Mr Leleu said. ‘She does not have expectations about fatherhood in the strict meaning of the word.‘It is a question of personal identity, it is a question of genealogy, it is a question of public recognition.’Ms Boël, who has two children with Irish-American construction boss James O\u0027Hare.She has always insisted that, as a wealthy woman in her own right, her court action was not motivated by money but her desire for her children to know their grandfather.          Albert (right) has alluded to problems with his marriage to Paola, former Queen of Beligum, in the past but has refused to admit Ms Boel is his daughter until now         Ms Boel is pictured alongside her husband, American James O\u0027Hare, in Brussels in 2008.

Her technique was nice,\u0027 Banda Aceh Sharia police chief investigator Zakwan, who uses one name, told AFP.The controversial punishment enrages rights activists and generates heated media debate, as well as amongst politicians.Indonesia\u0027s president has issued a call for the public floggings to stop but he has little say over what happens in Aceh, a deeply conservative region on Sumatra island.         Unlike the rest of the nation, Aceh follows religious law as part of a 2005 autonomy deal agreed with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.Here, public whipping remains a common punishment for scores of offenders for a range of charges including gambling, adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex.But the job has always been done by men. Until now.More and more women are being charged for morality crimes such as public affection or premarital sex, experts say, as greater internet access and globalisation bring clashes with local cultural and religious norms.Enforcement too has increased and now Aceh says it\u0027s trying to follow Islamic law, which calls for women to whip female perpetrators. This is already what happens in neighbouring Malaysia.But convincing women to participate has been no easy task, and it\u0027s taken years to assemble the first female squad, according to Safriadi, who heads provincial capital Banda Aceh\u0027s Sharia Implementation Unit.Eight women -- all Sharia officers -- agreed to be floggers and were trained in the appropriate technique and advised how to limit injury.Previously, a dozen men performed all the whippings in the city for an unspecified fee.For security reasons, Aceh officials declined to let AFP speak with the floggers, who are outfitted in cloth masks and loose fitting brown uniforms to hide their identities.We train them to make sure they\u0027re physically fit and teach them how to do a proper whipping, Zakwan said.But the secret for any whipping is getting past the mental hurdle of lashing fellow citizens.For that, you need to look to God, Zakwan said.It\u0027s kind of an indoctrination that we give to them so they have a better understanding of their role -- have no mercy for those who violate God\u0027s law\u0027, he added.- \u0027Too lenient\u0027 -Aceh officials insist caning deters crime, with patrols often scouring public places and establishments -- or acting on tip-offs -- to monitor behaviour.Sharia police in Banda Aceh, a city of some 220,000 people, are on the streets round-the-clock in three shifts.On a recent patrol, a couple sitting close to each other on the beach escaped with a reprimand.       Sharia police in Banda Aceh, a city of some 220,000 people, are on the streets round-the-clock in three shiftsBut a group of men and women spotted at a coffee shop around 3:00 am weren\u0027t so lucky and were arrested on suspicion of breaking strict codes about unmarried men and women interacting.This shows that we never sleep looking for violations of Sharia (Islamic law), Safriadi said.From behind bars, one of the men said that there was nothing romantic happening at the coffee shop.We don\u0027t even know the women and were sitting at different tables, he told AFP.The women were later released with a reprimand as were the men, but police said the trio may be charged for a new offence, after it was determined they were gay.Same-sex relations can earn residents a whipping in front of jeering crowds, which can number in the hundreds.Sharia in Aceh is still lenient, said resident Saiful Tengkuh.Aceh needs harsher punishments like stoning, not just whipping. Someone committing adultery should be stoned 100 times, he added.- \u0027Don\u0027t do it again\u0027 -Aceh, home to about 5 million people, once mulled beheading for serious crimes, but the central government ruled it out.This summer, it made headlines over a fatwa, or religious edict, against online game PlayerUnknown\u0027s Battlegrounds (PUBG) and opposing a national women\u0027s football league because it didn\u0027t have a stadium where only female players, match officials and spectators would be present.But whipping is often what gets Aceh in the news -- unwanted attention local officials say is Islamophobic.Advocates say many people caught breaking religious law choose whipping as an efficient, if painful, way to avoid a stiff jail term.But this rough justice can take a toll.Floggings can be so severe that people pass out or are hospitalised, with the most serious crimes -- including gay sex and having a relations with a minor -- earning as many as 150 lashes.Many offenders have fled the area out of shame or because customers deserted their businesses. Few are keen to discuss their experience.For women, arrest for even a minor violation can lead to victimisation, including sexual harassment and rape during arrest, according to research by the Network for Civil Society Concerned with Sharia.Reporting these assaults without proof can even open up victims to flogging for making a false accusation, it added.Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned such punishments as barbaric, inhumane, and tantamount to torture.But Aceh officials insist they\u0027re far more lenient than ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia and some other Muslim nations.We\u0027re not aiming to hurt people by whipping them, Safriadi said.The most important thing is the shaming effect on violators and spectators so they don\u0027t do it again."},{"url":null,"title":"Washington Post reporters revolt decision suspend colleague Kobe Bryant tweet","story":"Share this articleKobe Bryant¿s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser¿s Story, and the Half-Confession"},{"url":null,"title":"Arts Council England rebrands artists creative practitioners","story":"Share this article Sarah Maxfield, area director for the North at ACE, said: \u0027The North has more places categorised as being \u0027low-engaged\u0027 with culture than any other area of the country.\u0027In that sense we see real opportunity in the ten-year strategy to build up the opportunities for those low-engaging communities to draw up the cultural experiences that they want to have.\u0027         Sarah Maxfield, area director for the North at ACE, said the project will particularly target the north of EnglandArt budgets in the North for 2018 to 2022 have increased by 20 per cent, with ACE targeting places outside of London for investment.Several projects only have modest grants and are community based.   One project in Millom, a small town in Cumbria, was made possible with a £15,000 grant and targeted all areas of the community, from schools to farmers. As part of the ten-year strategy for \u0027inclusive economic growth\u0027, there will also be more investment in libraries, as well as other more traditional places. Since 2010, public library funding has been cut by 25 per cent with almost 10 per cent closing.Artists rebranded as creative practitioners by Arts Council England | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Horrific moment woman fifties flung air like RAGDOLL","story":"Share this article The pedestrians appear to realise the car is about to hit them and they raise their hands in the air. It appears that the woman is sent flying over a spiked metal fence, into which the car crashes. One commenter, Brinsley Evans, said: \u0027Omg looks like school kids.

Following the NBA legend’s death in a helicopter crash on Sunday, along with his daughter and seven others, Coelho said he would delete what the pair had worked on together.“You were more than a great player, dear Kobe Bryant. I learned a lot by interacting with you,” said Coelho. “Will delete the draft right now, this book has lost its reason.”The novelist shared an exchange he had with Bryant last August, when the basketball player, a five-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medallist, suggested writing a book together. “Any time,” responded Coelho, who was deluged with pleas from fans to finish the book as a tribute to Bryant.He told the Associated Press that Bryant had wanted his book to show underprivileged children they could overcome adversity through sport. Through his multimedia company Granity Studios, Bryant worked with writers to publish children’s book series featuring sport and magic.Coelho told AP that Bryant was “always very concerned about making a book that was a positive example for children, especially those coming from humble beginnings”.“It went from there. Little by little we were going ahead,” he said. “I saw him enough times to assure he had much more than sports on his mind, it wasn’t all about competition. His tragic death has shown already how he was important to the world, not only to the United States. We will discuss his legacy for many years, much beyond sport.”Someday, added Coelho, he may write “about things I learned from Kobe and how much of a larger-than-life person he was. But the children’s book did not make sense any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e5ebb780862d0a09d6e2f659bb8df2462648d2/0_370_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=726e391f1075c92806f038f3b7b266c2","title":"energy firms power cable national grid scottish power","story":"National Grid and Scottish Power project was two years late and has suffered outagesNational Grid and Scottish Power face an investigation by the energy industry regulator after repeatedly bungling the startup of a £1.3bn subsea power cable which is supported by home energy billpayers.The high-voltage power cable began transmitting renewable electricity from Scottish windfarms to homes and businesses in England and Wales in late 2017, about two years behind schedule.Since then it has suffered multiple outages due to faults along the 260-mile-long twin cable, which runs from the west coast of Scotland to the north coast of Wales, and has spent most of this year offline.Ofgem said it will review whether the joint venture set up by National Grid and Scottish Power breached their licence conditions by delivering the cable late. It will also examine potential breaches relating to the cable’s operation.The cable is a key part of the UK’s plans to use more clean energy because it will help to channel Scotland’s abundant renewable energy to areas in the south that have higher demand for electricity.When the cable is not operating there is a higher risk that windfarms may be paid to turn off, at a cost of millions of pounds to energy billpayers every week, to avoid overloading the local grids with more clean electricity than Scotland can use.The cable project also helps Scotland to import electricity from the rest of the country when wind speeds are low.In a joint statement the energy companies said they are confident that the project has delivered benefits to consumers since it began operating two years ago and will continue to “transport cleaner greener energy to our homes and businesses across Great Britain”.The cable has been offline for two weeks following an outage caused by a fault on land near the southern end of the line.“We are working hard to repair the current cable fault and are certain we will overcome these difficulties and establish a link that will continue to benefit consumers for many years to come,” the joint venture said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81f607548d3d2b5d307d402a773c785c398adfd/12_187_4229_2537/master/4229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6551284beaf3a4a5ec82b1258836a44","title":"neil woodford investors loss payouts","story":"Savers to receive initial payout of 46p to 57p per share compared with 100p launch priceThe administrators of the failed Woodford funds have told the 300,000 investors locked in since last June that they will receive an initial payout of just 46p to 57p per share – compared with the 100p price at launch five years ago.The payout is the first distribution of investments liquidated by the administrators, Link Asset Solutions, since the suspension in June, with about £2.1bn being handed back to investors.The money comes largely from sales of the “liquid”, easier-to-sell, part of the Woodford Equity Income fund, which was mostly shares in stock market quoted companies.A second distribution of cash will follow after the sale of the “unquoted” investments in the fund – stakes in companies that Woodford invested in but were not listed on the stock market. But the administrators have already warned investors that these assets are proving more difficult to sell than expected.The fund was once worth more than £10bn but suffered from a raft of poorly performing investments, including with estate agent Purplebricks, finance firm Burford and doorstep lender Provident Financial.A rival fund superstar, Terry Smith, who has attracted billions into his Fundsmith Equity fund from small investors, last week made a stinging assessment of Woodford’s performance.In a letter to his investors, he said: “The demise of Woodford Investment Management following the ‘gating’ of its main Woodford Equity Income fund was undoubtedly the main news in the industry last year.“We have no desire to engage in a general commentary on this matter or to engage in an unseemly exercise in schadenfreude. We had long identified the problems which were brewing at Woodford but we kept our own counsel on the matter.“The most obvious problem at Woodford was the lethal combination of a daily-dealing open-ended fund with significant holdings in unquoted companies and large percentage stakes in small quoted companies which had very limited liquidity.”Other funds such as M\u0026ampG’s £2.5bn property fund are also suspended because they are unable to easily sell their illiquid holdings, which include a number of retail parks and shopping centres. M\u0026ampG said in a note to investors on Tuesday that the suspension of the fund, which began on 4 December, will continue.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the Financial Conduct Authority for its failure to adequately supervise the Woodford fund.“Many small investors who were simply seeking a secure investment for their pension have been hurt by the failure of Woodford,” McDonnell said.“This isn’t just about the failure of Woodford. More importantly it’s about the failure of the regulatory system and in particular the FCA."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4232341babf5658c6c7dd0985a8f158fdde564a2/0_439_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeb2e082b7639fda5cd80f40215b647","title":"northern rail passengers uk franchise","story":"Survey results come as government prepares to halt franchise five years earlyPassengers on Northern rail are the least satisfied with their service, according to the official national survey which shows that the network – which stands on the brink of renationalisation – is rated the worst of all train operators.The results come as the government is poised to announce that the Arriva-operated Northern will have its franchise terminated five years early, with the network most likely to be taken back under direct state control. The announcement is expected to come as soon as Wednesday.The national rail passenger survey, a biannual report based on almost 28,000 passengers’ journeys, found that satisfaction on West Midlands had deteriorated the most, down by 11 percentage points since autumn 2018.South Western Railway (SWR) passengers – many of whom pay thousands of pounds for season tickets – were the most dissatisfied with the value for money of their journey. Barely one in three SWR passengers thought their fare represented good value.TransPennine Express (TPE) passengers were the most dissatisfied at the levels of overcrowding, with more than one in three objecting.The dire results come in spite of the survey being completed in the autumn before some of the worst problems on the railway occurred, including a month-long strike on SWR in December and regular walkouts on West Midlands.The methodology of the survey, which asks only about the last journey taken, within a limited time period, has been criticised by the statistics regulator for not fully reflecting passengers’ experience.The independent passenger watchdog Transport Focus says it needs more funding to run the survey continuously, but argues it still provides evidence “to push for wide-scale reform of the industry, and immediate improvement in reliability for the worst-affected areas”.The Transport Focus chief executive, Anthony Smith, said: “Passengers tell us that their biggest priority is rail services they can rely on to actually get them to work or home on time. Until train companies and Network Rail can consistently deliver on their promises across the country satisfaction will continue to vary.“In the meantime passengers hit by poor performance must make their voice heard and claim Delay Repay compensation.”Less than half of passengers nationwide are satisfied with the value of their ticket, with commuters in the south especially dissatisfied.However, performance in London and the south-east has improved markedly since the disruption sparked by the calamitous introduction of new services in the May 2018 timetable. The fallout resulted in overall national satisfaction with rail journeys sinking to its lowest level in a decade in the autumn 2018 survey released a year ago.The best-scoring rail operators were the smallest operations: Heathrow Express, Grand Central and Hull trains.Industry body the Rail Delivery Group welcomed the slight improvement from autumn 2018 – although the results are worse than the spring survey, which consistently shows happier passengers than the autumn poll.The RDG director of nations and regions, Robert Nisbet, said: “While we are working hard to address challenges on some routes where train punctuality should be better, today’s improved satisfaction scores show that passengers are feeling the benefits of investment in thousands of new carriages and extra services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd90ae1f9cab3d6e6dd27763e21ecd3d897000f/0_213_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b16b5982ce975c1ec8e22b51a763e538","title":"deputy leader labour post brexit uk","story":"If you are happy with where the Labour party is now, read no further.

We need to be honest about this so we can find the solutions.Our members, who campaigned tirelessly for weeks, are more honest about what it was really like to face the voters every day of the campaign.But the narrative in the Labour leadership elections has become about defending the status quo. That can’t be the way forward.We can’t simply go on as we are, with a different voice and different face but the same message.I want us to change, because that is the only way we will win power again.If people don’t want change and are happy with things as they are, with an 80-seat Tory majority and many asking if the Labour party will survive, then I’m not their candidate – don’t vote for me. A continuity candidate would be their best bet.I’m the candidate who wants to be in government.I will never rubbish what the last Labour government achieved. I find it infuriating that people in our party are prepared to dismiss the life-changing differences we made between 1997 and 2010.They should remember how they felt on 13 December last year, and then take a couple of minutes to watch the start of Gordon Brown’s speech to the 2009 Labour conference, where he listed just some of what Labour achieved in government – including lifting millions of out of poverty. No, it wasn’t a continuation of Thatcherism. It was using the power of government to deliver transformational change. I want our party to have that opportunity again.That starts with understanding what we got wrong in the most recent election, and what we need to get right in the future. It means listening to voters in the seats we held, the seats we lost and the seats we may never win.Central to winning is building broad coalitions of people with different and varied interests. That’s something I’ve achieved in the constituency I represent in every election I have fought. I have passed the “marginal seat” test again and again. I won in Edinburgh South because I know Tory, Liberal Democrat and SNP voters are not our enemy. They are all potential Labour voters, and we must reach out to them all.And we must care about every single region and nation of this United Kingdom.If elected deputy leader, I will take responsibility for the party’s approach to how the UK should be governed in a post-Brexit Britain, so that no city, town or community is left behind. Having a Scot at the top of the UK Labour party sends out the message that every part of our UK from the south west to the very north of Scotland matters.I will launch a Labour Campaign for Britain’s Future, with our values of togetherness at its heart.The Labour movement must make the case for a much closer relationship with Europe, restoring our reputation, and working to grow our economy on behalf of workers in every community, leave or remain. We should never rule out campaigning to be part of the EU again in the future if it is in the national interest.The Labour party’s values of internationalism and solidarity are why we should always be a pro-UK and a pro-Europe party.The best way of standing up for Labour values is to be clear about what we stand for.Never again can we face both ways on the biggest issues of our time.If we can’t stand up for the future of the UK and play a central part in Europe, then we stand for nothing. I can’t stand by and watch the party I love lose another election after losing four in the past 10 years. We need to change.I have a detailed plan ready to go. I just need help from members to implement it.The choice at this election is clear – changing to be a credible alternative government or staying the same and becoming a diminishing party of perpetual opposition.

The wreckage of the aircraft scattered across an area the size of a football field, and a day later the LA coroner’s office was still gathering remains from the site. The helicopter had reportedly taken off in dense fog en route to a girls’ basketball tournament in nearby Thousand Oaks, California, where some of the passengers were set to compete: among those on board was 13-year-old Gianna Bryant, an aspiring basketball player. The helicopter belonged to her father, the basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, who was also on board, and reportedly it was decked out like a limousine, with a cavernous interior and soft leather seats. There were no survivors.The death of Kobe Bryant has shocked sports fans and observers in part because he seemed like the sort of person who could never die. On the court, he moved with an uncommon skillfulness and grace, moving the ball from his opponents’ reach with the alacrity and sleight of hand of a magician, leaping into the air with the elegant reach of a ballerina. Though he had a thin jaw and hollow cheeks, his face had something boyish about it. Maybe it was because he had rocketed to fame as a teenager, recruited to the NBA straight out of high school. Or maybe it was the dimple that appeared when he smiled, which he did often and easily. With his alarming physical skill and his aura of joyfulness and minor arrogance, he seemed to possess a permanent and transcendent youthfulness, as if he was always going to be a teenager. In reality, he was old for an athlete when he retired in 2016. He died at 41.Obituaries and hagiographies for Bryant rolled in the hours following the crash, and most of them focused on the parts of the story that were easiest to understand tragedy of his sudden death, the beauty of his athletic skill, now lost forever. They carefully and conspicuously elided one of the most significant episodes of Bryant’s public life: that in 2003, a woman said that he raped her in his room at the Colorado hotel where she worked as a concierge. She was strikingly young, too: at the time she says he raped her, the woman was just 19.The rape accusation defined Bryant’s career during the mid-aughts. First, it was the subject of a criminal trial, in which it was revealed that Bryant had first denied having any contact with the accuser, then changed his story when confronted with evidence by the police – evidence such as the bruise on her neck, consistent with her claim that Bryant had choked her, as well as the tears and bruises on her genitals, his semen inside her, and her blood on his shirt. During the criminal proceedings, the media and Bryant’s legal team used the accuser’s real name repeatedly, and dragged out lurid details of her sexual and psychiatric history as evidence that she couldn’t be trusted. She was hounded by the media, smeared as slutty and crazy in print, and threatened by fans. Eventually, she stopped cooperating with the investigation. This could be because she made the whole thing up, and realized that she made a mistake. That is possible. It is also possible, and more likely, that she stopped cooperating because she was 19, terrified, and facing the full force of media hostility and the legal resources of a very rich, globally popular man.The criminal case was dropped and the accuser filed a civil suit, which Bryant settled in 2005. The payout is confidential, but was rumored to be about $2.5m. Bryant’s reputation recovered, the episode behind him, and he regained sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Nike. He soon signed a seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, worth $136m. He bought his wife a comically gigantic diamond ring, seemingly to apologize.Now that Bryant is dead, it is likely that for his accuser, the traumas of the trial and media attention will be reproduced in miniature. She might be hounded online, or asked for comment by reporters. She might receive threats. At the very least, she will be reminded of what were probably the worst months of her life. For her, we can wish security and peacefulness and loving, supportive surroundings in what is likely a more complicated and distressing time for her than we can imagine. We can wish her safety, and privacy.But to those mourning for Bryant as they remembered him – as an athlete, or a philanthropist, or as an avatar of youthfulness, skill and success – these wishes can seem very inconvenient, even insulting to their grief. In the hours after Bryant’s death, any mention of the rape accusation on social media was met with derision, contempt or calls not to speak ill of the dead. There is a sense that the alleged rape is minor compared with the rest of Bryant’s legacy, that the pain of his young accuser is irrelevant, and should not be debited from Bryant’s moral account. This chorus has put feminists in the position of making the assertion that rape is more morally significant than basketball.At the same time, it is difficult not to sympathize with those who are grieving Bryant, those fans for whom he inspired envy and awe. To some of them, the rape accusation might be unbelievable, an anecdote that does not temper or complicate their grief but rather intensifies it: they may see him as a victim of a lie, a vengeful and possibly racist one. Others, more darkly, might believe the accusation but think that it reflects well on Bryant, seeing sexual violence not as a betrayal of the hope that he symbolized but as a sign of the youthfulness and masculine vitality that he displayed with such beauty on the court. There are people – men, mostly – who think of rape this way: not as a brutal violation of a woman but as a signal of a man’s liveliness.But the reality is that most of those who are grieving Bryant are simply not thinking about his accuser very much at all. That something happened between them is all most of us will ever know about her, but it is just one of scores of things we know about him.For my part, I find myself thinking less about Bryant than about his young daughter, Gianna, who died with him in the crash. Those who wanted to believe in the better vision of Bryant noted that he was taking her to her own basketball tournament. This, they implied, was a sign that he could not be a misogynist, or a rapist, because he was choosing to spend time with his daughter, choosing to invest in her talent, her ambition. It is hard to accept that this Bryant, this version of him as a kindly father spending time with a young girl, could coexist within the same man who put his hands around the neck of a woman not much older than that daughter, and squeezed. That both of these people could potentially live inside one body – the attentive father, the allegedly violent rapist – is the great mystery and contradiction of Kobe Bryant’s life.Gianna was 13 when she died, a year that is euphemistically referred to as a “tender age”. It’s tender in part because 13 is around the age when girls become aware of the role that they are ageing into, aware of the injustices, indignities, violences and double standards that will be imposed on them when they are women, because they are women. By 13, you grow breasts and start getting catcalled it becomes clear that some men will express their desire for you along with resentment and malice. For Gianna, a black girl growing into a black woman, the injustices and indignities she was facing down were even greater and crueler. Every woman navigates the perils of womanhood in her own way, and maybe Gianna would have been skillful, or lucky. Maybe she would have been insulated from sexism by her father’s fame and money, or by the education that he could have bought her maybe she would have developed a deep inner reservoir of dignity and resolve that some women draw on in the face of sexist injustice. Maybe she would have grown up to resent her father for the alleged attack, or maybe she would have forgiven him, made some kind of peace in adulthood with his darkness and inconsistencies. We simply do not know what kind of person she would have become. Now, we will never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d29ff901600405af12cab968764928ed3d8671/0_90_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e749744dddadd222af483249d9841bb","title":"labour deputy leader trade union equality","story":"In just 10 weeks’ time, the Labour party will have a new leader.Jeremy Corbyn, who revived the party and made so many people who had given up on politics take another look at Labour, will step down and the new leader will take over.Whoever takes over the reins of the party will be facing a sterner challenge than any Labour leader of recent times. The party has been undeniably ided for the past five years and those isions have played into the hands of those who were opposed to the transformative vision the party was offering. Ultimately, we paid the price for this disunity and we lost the faith of many of those who need us the most.The new leadership team will need to re-energise our core voters and win back those who have turned away from the party, all while facing down an emboldened Conservative party led by Boris Johnson.The only way Labour will be able to achieve all of this is if we create a credible transformative government-in-waiting with senior figures in the party all pulling in the same direction. Working-class communities cannot afford another decade of Tory rule and, as deputy leader, I would not allow that to happen. It was more than a decade ago that I became the first black woman to speak at the Commons dispatch box, when I was minister for young citizens and youth engagement.It is easy to talk the talk of unity but I have walked the walk, serving under two Labour prime ministers and Corbyn, always using my platform to fight for working people and disadvantaged communities rather than engage in infighting.A lot has been said about identities in these leadership elections.As shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, I am well aware of the power of representation, and the value of marginalised groups seeing people who look like them and who share some of their life experiences in the corridors of power.But without the right policies, and the resolve to carry them out, identity is just a PR exercise. To paraphrase Gary Younge, we want equal opportunities, not photo opportunities. I am a working-class, black, female trade unionist, but the reason I’m hoping that Labour members elect me in April is because they see that I have the right vision for how a campaigning deputy leader should serve the party and the experience and determination to deliver.The deputy leader of the Labour party should be neither an unquestioning cheerleader for the leader nor a public rallying point for those who wish to undermine or overthrow the leader. I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating: my focus would be to prepare our party for power by rooting it at the heart of communities, whether in those rural and small towns we lost across the country, or in our inner-city heartlands.On day one of a Labour government, as deputy leader, my priority would be to ensure the repeal of draconian anti-trade union legislation. The workplace needs to be fit for the 2020s and I would campaign to bring in more flexible working and to ban zero-hours contracts, which often result in lower-income workers being exploited, without holiday, sickness or maternity provision.As deputy leader, I would continue to engage proactively with unions, which are at the forefront of campaigns to protect workers’ rights. When I was a trade union officer, I developed the Core strategy (campaign, organise, recruit and educate) with the TUC and believe this will be the basis of our fightback.I would develop a comprehensive organiser programme rooted in communities from the south-west to Scotland to take community activism to the next level. I would ensure there were more organisers actively working on the ground than ever before to rebuild trust across the country and to win local councillors, mayors, assembly members, police and crime commissioners and more.At the last election, I worked with members, campaigners, faith groups and union members to develop Labour’s race and faith manifesto, which demonstrated how much we value faith and our commitment to ensuring we strengthen every community’s right to practise religion free from persecution. I am committed to championing policies that value and accept all communities and their freedoms.I have pledged to implement in full the recommendations of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. That we are the only party (other than the BNP) to be investigated by the EHRC brings shame upon us all.I would work closely with the Jewish community and organisations to stamp this out once and for all and have offered to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement. I would meet any organisation that wishes to work with me in eradicating the scourge of antisemitism from society and the Labour party. I would help Labour develop its policies on immigration reform to ensure we take a moral and ethical stance to support refugees and never repeat the scandals of the Tories’ hostile environment to immigrants and the appalling treatment of the Windrush generation.My family first came to the UK as part of that same Windrush generation to build a better life for themselves as well as to help build a better country I will never undervalue Britain’s migrant communities who bring energy and vibrancy to our nation. While the autopsy on what went wrong for Labour last December will take time, this should not stop us from developing a strategy to win. I would hit the ground running. I have the experience to take on the Tories from day one and the credibility to beat them.That is why, as deputy leader, I have a plan to prepare for power. And as deputy leader I would also work in tandem with whoever Labour members decide to elect as leader as part of a unified team.Anything less would be letting down the very people we are here to work for.• Dawn Butler is the Labour MP for Brent South, and the shadow minister for women and equalities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30fd1252301d89e0ed4b64aa89bf7441fb46aa7/0_112_3400_2039/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c9953f50d2e2cb0eec7361909ae739","title":"labour split affection corbyn","story":"Affection for Corbyn remains but on the ground party members have seen why people didn’t back himThe postmortem was grim. In the room, leading Labour MPs, recent party staffers and assorted Labour figures of long experience pored over the entrails exposed by the high priests of polling and academia. Pointers for the future lie in this gruesome raking over of the details. Too many in Labour give only token nods to the cataclysmic abyss that has opened up between the party and the voters out there.Unprecedented doesn’t mean impossible, never say die: despair after the great 1992 election shock left many reading Labour’s funeral rites. Yet that same year Black Wednesday struck the Tories down as the UK fell out of the European exchange rate mechanism, and within no time, John Smith, then Tony Blair, applied the defibrillators that jump-started Labour back to life. But the task now is of another order: like climbing Everest backwards, blindfolded and without oxygen.This meeting of party figures was not a cabal for a leadership candidate, but had supporters of four contenders (held just before Jess Phillips dropped out). None, I think, were Rebecca Long-Bailey backers, with her daunting Unite and Momentum support. That’s the great schism, between the Corbynites and the rest, that no candidate dare name. It’s a split each candidate claims to be the one to mend without quite defining.This deep-e exposed just how appallingly the election was run at the top, a hair-raising picture with graphic examples worse than anything I’d heard so far. It became a kind of therapy for those who had endured it. It highlighted abuse from the doorstep by former Labour voters who feared Jeremy Corbyn, called him unpatriotic, antisemitic, spendthrift, untrustworthy on crime, and a lot more.But worse was their own party’s bullying, favouritism and fixed seat-selections the sudden removal from Bassetlaw of a non-Corbynite candidate was a prime case. Fixing was not unknown under previous Labour regimes but this was almost beyond belief. Only true Corbyn candidates were rewarded with volunteers and resources, regardless of polling showing where help was most needed. Some seats were needlessly lost as a result.Some party officers, chosen for their loyalty to Corbyn, had never run any election and failed to get out the free postal forms until after the postal ballots had arrived. Shadow cabinet ministers tell of arriving at TV studios to be asked about Labour’s latest policy of which they knew nothing – sent out cluelessly to defend the £58bn for Waspi women, or free broadband.Why pick over the bones of the election? Because places on the National Executive Committee, which oversees the party – and which is currently majority-Corbynite – come up for election with the leadership ballot. Will the membership yet again opt for Momentum-slate candidates who vote with craven obedience, or will they choose people who think freely?Long-Bailey on the NEC has loyally voted with the slate, failing to deal with the antisemitism cases that darkened Labour’s name. She agreed to the attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s deputy leader position. Jon Lansman, the Momentum leader who led this failed drive-by shooting, now runs her campaign. Awarding Corbyn “10 out of 10” for leadership, Long-Bailey calls for even tougher mandatory reselections of all MPs, though that split local parties ahead of the election.Len McCluskey vigorously promoting Long-Bailey on Monday’s Today programme, ascribes election defeat entirely to Labour’s failure to back Brexit, blaming Keir Starmer. Others see Starmer as the man who prevented a massive flight of remainers – and the abandonment of the party’s own principles. Had Labour sided with Tory Brexiteers, what might they say when those northern seats suffer Brexit blowback?Labour MPs’ disastrously ill-judged attempt to remove Corbyn in 2016, after his reluctant stance in the referendum campaign, created a rift with the membership. But that may be closing, as the party dangles on the edge.Affection for Corbyn remains strong: no wonder no candidate dares say honestly what went wrong. Nor dare they pledge to clear out Corbyn’s cronies from top party posts: shockingly the Observer revealed a series of key party positions are being rapidly filled with Corbynists to tie the hands of a new leader. Yet, on the ground, energetic young Momentum and other members have been nose to nose with voters who told them briskly why they weren’t voting Labour.Labour splits many ways. Oddly, its centre-left Progress wing, which backed Jess Phillips– likeable but not a plausible leader – turned against Starmer for staying in Corbyn’s cabinet and failing to denounced him now. They pose as “realists” ready to do whatever electability demands, yet fail to engage with what getting chosen by Labour’s membership requires. True, Starmer’s no centrist but from the soft left, aiming to make the best Labour policies credible, while the hard left call him Tory-lite and worse.Yet unity may be easier than it now looks. A convincing Starmer victory would bind up wounds some Corbynites might return to the socialist splinter groups from whence they came. Most will stay – and people change when times change, as they did in the 1990s.The result hangs in the balance. In polls Starmer is ahead of Long-Bailey, with Lisa Nandy’s intelligent campaign gaining ground, though few of the 650 constituencies are yet revealed. The signs are that most election-shocked members sincerely want someone to win for them. But between now and 4 April, when the result is declared, the Unite and Momentum machines will grind hard to keep their grip on the party. If they succeed, a party well used to roller-coaster rides faces its greatest existential crisis since the 1930s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4c202555168151927180277e706d855f6af66f3/0_107_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317be1bcb2d20e3cfab290a690b777a3","title":"nation 50p brexit britain philip pullman oxford comma","story":"Philip Pullman’s complaint over an Oxford comma is the first shot in another irrelevant culture war remainers are sure to loseWhat’s the maddest you’ve ever been at a coin? At school, once, there was a scuffle for a lost 20p, five or six large pubescent boys all jostling for it, each claiming they had spied it first and in the midst of that, I – the first and only boy, truly, to spot the 20p – bent down to grasp it and, at that exact moment, got body-bounced from behind and ended up scraping my fingers along the exposed brickwork of the quad, a cheese-grater sensation I can still, when I want to, wince about today.In the intervening years, having grown up, I’ve found it hard to get similarly worked up about a coin. And then Philip Pullman came along.“The ‘Brexit’ 50p coin is missing an Oxford comma,” the acclaimed author tweeted on Sunday, “and should be boycotted by all literate people.” To give a flavour of the quality of the country’s discourse, the tweet became, when ground through the hard mincer gears of journalism, not simply a throwaway joke Pullman made in the face of some early-morning writer’s block, but the closest thing we’ve had post-Y2K to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.“Author Philip Pullman has declared war on the new Brexit 50p - but it’s nothing to do with politics,” the BBC wrote, ticking the Doomsday Clock ever closer to midnight. “Author Philip Pullman moans new Brexit 50p coin is missing Oxford comma,” the Daily Mail went, before detailing how the remainer was thoroughly schooled on Twitter for his error. Ever thoughtful and classy, the Express went with: “Brexit 50p coin: What is an Oxford comma? Should it be on Brexit 50p coin?”, hoping to loop in the lucrative “jabs very blunt search terms into Google while squinting at their large-font iPad” crowd who make up so much of the bustling, ever-moving internet.The weird thing about Pullmangate is that it both ides and amplifies all the voices of Brexit at once, in a way that is both completely fascinating and utterly irrelevant, and most of all, absolutely, undeniably, embarrassingly British.So on one side you have People Who Have Been Waiting For An Oxford Comma Debate All Their Life. You know these people, you walk among them: they walk up to harried waiting staff and say, “What’s an ‘avacado’, then?” as if spotting a typo gets them a gold award they can get five answers in a row on University Challenge but end up bankrupting themselves in court because they’ve decided to challenge an archaic piece of legislation that somehow affected their house move eight years ago.To give you an example, Alastair Campbell tweeted, “I for one shall be asking shopkeepers for ‘two 20p pieces and a 10’ if they offer me a 50p coin pretending that Brexit is about ‘peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations’,” and you can imagine the former Blair attack dog directing a tired newsagent, who’s stoically watching a queue form behind him, to open a fresh bag of 20 pences and empty them into the till because Big Ali Campbell doesn’t like Brexit. These are the people who lost.The people who won, meanwhile, are happy the 50p is even happening in the first place, because it’s the only physical token of Brexit that actually exists. For over three years Brexit has been a concept in the air, a 55-comment Facebook status, a surefire pub argument, but it hasn’t actually been anything because it hasn’t happened. Is a clear and intelligible relationship with Europe sorted? No. Are we any closer to the Island of Utopia Brexit promises? Not really. But in getting sucked into a culture war over a coin, both Remainiacs and Brexiteers create the illusion of Brexit being “done” in a single moment on Friday, when, really, it isn’t. It’s almost like a test administered by some experimental arm of the government: after three years, here’s a low circulation coin. Your emotional reaction to it reveals your true feelings about Europe.For my money, the Oxford comma is an outmoded piece of prescriptivism that doesn’t particularly affect meaning and is aesthetically prim, and is therefore bad. But an argument about an Oxford comma embossed on a coin that has already once had to be scrapped and melted down at large cost to the taxpayer because the government got the date wrong of its own exit from Europe? That’s actually really good.It’s also the Brexit debate in a microcosm: here we are, in the historic week where it all actually happens (kind of), when we all assemble around a silent Big Ben as it mutely bongs us out of Europe, and it all feels … a bit flat, doesn’t it? Like, yes: the EU anthem Ode to Joy has re-entered the charts as some sort of Lib Dem thumb in the face of God, like everyone who ever got Rage Against the Machine to Christmas #1 once grew up, got a Bupa policy but still thought “buying music” was a viable form of protest. And, yes, Romford’s Tory MP Andrew Rosindell told the Sunday Express that he’ll be holding possibly the most vibeless party in European history, with “a great British buffet with food from around the UK and English sparkling wine - nothing French or German but everything British and Commonwealth”. But who cares?This is what we deserve, what we all deserve. After three years of Farage on a flotilla and “enough!” and elections and more elections and another election then two more elections, this is what Brexit boils down to: a grey week in January where we’re all waiting for an endless payday and getting furiously mad about a 50p. It is simply stunning that any country ever respected us.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17faf53d3a91b3687222a4b8a96033a39ec6d238/0_260_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5fc72e29cf83a520a844abcd35b90b","title":"tell us about your most creative solution to combat waste","story":"Increasing waste is a big global problem.

In previous years there’s been Saw, Hereditary, Get Out, The Babadook and The Blair Witch Project but this year, the scariest film isn’t about a sadistic killer or an evil cult. It’s not even a scary movie in any traditional sense. It’s a film about the bone-chilling horror of living with dementia and it’ll haunt me for weeks.Based on the acclaimed, award-winning play, The Father starts out as a deceptively simple drama hinged on a deceptively familiar dynamic. Anne (Olivia Colman) is losing patience with her 80-year-old father, Anthony (Anthony Hopkins), whose grip on reality is fading but who refuses to allow a carer to look after him. She’s moving to Paris and needs to ensure his safety while she is away so before she leaves she must find someone who will endure him. For Anthony, life has become a source of ever-disorienting confusion and in a masterful stroke, the writer-director Florian Zeller (who created the original stage production) tells the story from his eyes as characters and locations shift and we become as muddled as he.Anthony is essentially a character in a trippy thriller who exists in a real world drama. He thinks he’s being gaslighted in one moment and in the other he questions the very nature of his existence as his daughter is suddenly someone else (confusingly for us, it’s another Olivia: Olivia Williams) and his apartment has been refurnished in a matter of moments. It’s an ingenious way to convey the horrifying state of mind of someone with dementia, how every day is filled with sudden shocks and how impossible it must be to let someone else understand just what you’re going through. We’re mostly in one location but due to the ever-changing nature of Anthony’s surroundings, Zeller’s film is one of the more impressively realised stage-to-screen adaptations of late. There are constant tweaks made to his apartment from the decor to the layout and we begin to question everything along with him, always wondering what the real truth might be.It’s a difficult, often quite brutal, viewing experience, as it needs to be given the subject matter, not only because of the fractured storytelling but because of the devastating lead performance from Hopkins, experiencing something of a career resurgence with an Oscar nomination this year for The Two Popes. He’s now comfortably an early front-runner for the 2021 race with a turn so crushingly effective that I can’t see how any other actor could beat him. It’s astounding, heartbreaking work, watching him try to rationally explain to himself and those around him what he’s experiencing. In some of the film’s most quietly upsetting moments, his world has shifted yet again but he remains silent, knowing that any attempt to question what he’s woken up to will only fall on deaf ears. Hopkins runs the full gamut from fury to outrage to upset and never once does it feel like a constructed character bit, despite our association with him as an actor with a storied career. It’s breathtaking to watch him here but also incredibly harrowing.It’s his show but Colman gets some impactful moments along the way and the film is generous enough to understand that it’s an unbearably frustrating process for those around someone with the condition as well. As one might expect, The Father is a hopeless tale, with Zeller taking us down further as the condition worsens with the knowledge that things won’t be getting any better, that he won’t be getting out. It’s an experience many people will understandably want to avoid, existing just too close to home for a lot of us, easily swapping out Hopkins and inserting a family member in his place. But for those who can stomach it, it’ll stay with you, for longer than you might like. I know it will stay with me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3514c32830365d1052ff6671b261fb0c968b471b/1973_0_3065_1839/master/3065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8fd4eff2906f274231512a584460296","title":"oscars 2020 nominees photo al pacino stubby legs","story":"From backwards caps to Tarantino’s petrol-pump attendant look, this year’s class photo had its standout oddities.

Afterwards, they are manhandled willy-nilly into an unflattering multi-tiered crescent next to curtains of nondescript colour so someone can take their picture from afar. Think of it as a wedding picture for people better than you.But this year things changed. The Oscar nominees luncheon photo for 2020 has taken place in an empty white vortex. It’s still an incredibly unflattering photograph, but it has the additional benefit of making the attendees look like they’ve just died and emerged blinking into the afterlife. Here, as usual, are this year’s winners:Even if he’s unsuccessful on Oscar night, documentary director Khan deserves credit for understanding the dynamics of a group photo. This is the Oscars, so he knows his competitors will mostly be grey-haired middle-aged men in dark suits. By going so red, with such commitment, he deserves our respect.(Main picture: third row, second from left)Much was made of the primarily plant-based menu served at the luncheon. The nominees ate roasted maitake mushroom mixed with forbidden black rice, winter squash, cauliflower and red curry. And yet Todd Phillips turned up in a white suit. He spent the entire meal teetering precariously on the edge of a catastrophic curry spill that would have ruined his photo forever. And yet he did it anyway. How brave. How edgy.(Main picture: sixth row, sixth from left)Let’s do the honourable thing and blame the photographer for this. Pacino is out in front, on his feet, staring up at a photographer positioned far above him, which isn’t a flattering place to be for anyone. But, for someone of relatively diminutive stature, it makes you look a bit like a little boy in his dad’s clothes asking for sweets. Sorry Al.Be honest. This was where your eye was drawn first. Among all the conservative respect-clothing of the other diners, Bates and Powell stand out like a sore thumb. They’re having a great time. They look like they’re about four margaritas in already. We need to see a film where Kathy Bates and Sandy Powell get trashed in Vegas, and it needs to be good enough for them both to be invited back next year.(Main picture: third row, 12th from right)This is very sweet. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are married, and nominated for the songs they wrote together for Frozen II. They’ve been married since 2003, which is a lifetime in Hollywood terms. And yet apparently they do not know how to hold hands. How does this even work? They both look like they were doing inidual bicep curls, and awkwardly attempted to join them together at the top. It’s weird. I’m frightened.Most people at the luncheon understood the dress code and stuck to it no matter what. Others found clever ways to subvert it, maybe by forgoing a tie. But Quentin Tarantino cares so little about rules that he rocked up in something that made him look like he came fifth in a semi-professional 10-pin bowling league in 1958. No wonder Robert De Niro can’t make eye contact with him.(Main picture: fourth row, seventh from left)The most ostentatious luncheon attendees are always the ones who opt for unconventional hats. Buckley gives off the look of someone who went to the event in a baseball cap as a surly “screw you” to the comfortable formality of the Academy, only to bottle it in front of his heroes by turning it around and pushing it all the way up to the top of his head where nobody could see it. But we can see it. Oh, we can see it.(Main picture: fifth row, second from left)Randy Newman has been nominated for more Oscars than you could even count. He’s done this before, countless times. This might be why he appears to be asking the photographer to step outside for a fight.(Main picture: fourth row, third from left)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/479856d23a29eea510d95356294cd940c974d822/0_267_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b1321f9d00880faa558d7b50e675a77","title":"why 1917 should win the best picture oscar","story":"We start our annual series with the frontrunner: Sam Mendes’s cinematic groundbreaker, which immerses us in the horror of war as never beforeEver since All Quiet on the Western Front, the least we’ve come to expect from a war-is-hell actioner is grungy realism. Yet in Sam Mendes’s 1917, the trenches are dry, wide and handsomely constructed. Uniforms look fresh out of Brooks Brothers. Even the rats seem pet-shop friendly. The flatlands of Flanders improbably furnish rapids and a plunging cataract, while corpse-strewn, shell-ravaged battlefields quickly give way to flower-strewn meadows. The incineration of a town becomes an alluring firework display.This unconvincing backdrop foregrounds cardboard cutout protagonists devoid of backstory or interiority. Minor roles are cliched caricatures, peppered with pointlessly distracting star cameos. Wooden dialogue limits the scope for acting prowess. A bald, subplot-less storyline embraces both sentimentality and implausibility, as our hero-in-a-hurry takes time out to succour an abandoned baby with milk he happens to have picked up on the way, and skips across no man’s land miraculously immune to shot and shell.In an exceptional year featuring masterworks from Tarantino and Scorsese, and the brilliance of Parasite and Marriage Story, who would imagine that a standard man-with-a-mission war film like this might snag that best picture Oscar? Well, the bookies certainly do, placing 1917 way in front of the competition. The film has already picked up best drama at the Golden Globes since 2000, seven winners of that prize have gone on to take the Oscar. Even more auspiciously, it’s made best picture at the PGA awards, the most reliable predictors of Academy gold, with 13 of their post-millennium alumni copping the big one.How come? 1917 owes everything to what unkind folks might call a gimmick. But this isn’t an awkward contrivance like the digital de-aging in The Irishman – a fancy bolt-on that sort of works and sort of doesn’t. Mendes has bet the farm on an all-encompassing technical feat that’s so successful it singlehandedly makes his film an unmatchable cinematic achievement. Famously, 1917 is shot with the camera following the hero, George MacKay’s Lance Corporal Will Schofield we see the world as he sees it, for almost all of a relentless Ghent-to-Aix odyssey, in what gives the appearance of a single take.Hitchcock needed to paper over his edits because 35mm film magazines had to be changed every 10 minutes. Digital cinematography knows no such limits. Thus, Alexander Sokurov was able to shoot his Russian Ark in 2002 in an uninterrupted, 96-minute wander through the Hermitage museum. Obviously, that degree of continuity would have been unattainable in the fast-changing location of complex-action war film, but developments in post-production now enable film-makers to stitch together long takes into an apparently seamless whole.In 1917, these technical opportunities are exploited as never before. Schofield’s assignment is simply to deliver a message calling off an attack that is going to be ambushed. Yet as we accompany him, dodging bullets and wading through corpses, sharing experiences including the bizarre fate of his fellow messenger, feeling his terror, exhilaration and despair, we gain a more intense appreciation of the horror of war than anything cinema has previously managed. The film’s various eccentricities and deficiencies pale into insignificance as its singular modus operandi grips you by the throat.Schofield has been compared to a computer-game avatar. There’s something in that, but this is an avatar made of flesh and blood, who feels and breathes. Once you’ve seen this film, you won’t forget it. You can’t necessarily say that of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which seems to be 1917’s main competitor for the top slot. Gorgeous and satisfying though Tarantino’s film is, it doesn’t quite make cinema history. 1917 does. And that’s why it deserves the statuette.

When he took the UK into the European Economic Community in January 1973, he celebrated the occasion by spending a quarter of a million of your sterling pounds on the Fanfare for Europe, an 11-day festival that included, among more than 150 other cultural high-points, concerts by Slade, the Kinks, Status Quo, the Chieftains, and the Orchestre de Paris conducted by Georg Solti. Fast forward 47 years, and what does Boris Johnson, self-styled natural-born showman, have lined up for the similarly epochal Brexit Day? Not a great deal, by the looks of it. A new interpretation of John Cage’s 4’33” by the avant-garde campanologist Mark “Hot Mallets” Francois isn’t exactly scratching our itch.Yes, the past is a different country, and they have better trade links there. Fanfare ’73 was a wide-ranging celebration of a new cultural and economic union with our friends on the continent: Fonteyn and Nureyev in Swan Lake at Covent Garden Albert Finney performing the work of Samuel Beckett a symposium on visual language by Jacques Tati. There were exhibitions of French impressionism and Italian futurism, a display of contemporary Scandi design, and a grand market of the latest European art. (The market had so many fancy pieces on sale, the taxpayer was forced to foot a £60,000 insurance bill. An eye-watering premium, until you remember it was only six and a half years since the World Cup, at which England’s top security professionals and the politan Police had to be bailed out by Pickles and his inquisitive wet nose. Worth every penny for peace of mind alone.)Not everything was absurdly highbrow. A night of comedy at the Royal Albert Hall with Bruce Forsyth, Dick Emery and Leslie Crowther. A vintage car rally from London to Brussels led by Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. A beauty contest on pre-Me-Too ITV, won by Sylvia Kristel, later the star of special-interest motion flick Emmanuelle. Britain’s third television channel also transmitted – bear with us, we’re getting very close to the bit about the football – a special edition of popular talent show Opportunity Knocks! featuring acts from some nations of the newly enlarged EEC.Some, you’ll have noticed, but not all. German, Danish and Luxembourgian television declined to take part, appalled at the low quality of the programme. “Words failed them,” reported some poor bugger from the Foreign Office who had been roped into tense negotiations with unctuous host and media grifter Hughie Green. They also didn’t care for Green’s oleaginous delivery ... and they meant that most sincerely. Their loss, though. No less a superstar than Johan Cruyff (!!!) was coerced into appearing on the programme. In a brief interview, Cruyff reassured viewers whiling away the minutes until Coronation Street that British football would not be adversely affected by the UK’s membership of the EEC. A performance of his 1969 hit single Oei Oei Oei, Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei, a woozy carouse o’clock bierkeller stomp that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on the first side of Scott 2, was presumably considered too outre for 6.45pm Monday on Thames.Cruyff wasn’t the only continental soccer star shipped over the briny to join in the celebrations. The Common Market Match at Wembley pitted representatives of the Three – the UK was joining the EEC along with the Republic of Ireland and Denmark – against players from the Six, the founder members Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. Sir Alf Ramsey took charge of the Three, while the man he bested at the 1966 World Cup final, Helmut Schön, was put in control of the Six.All nations supplied at least one player, except Luxembourg and Wales. The latter’s snub is unlikely to have been a prime factor in the country’s decision to vote leave at the 2016 referendum, surely ... but then some Welsh fans still hold a grudge against Joe Jordan, so you never know. It was a star-studded affair. The Six XI positively dripped with exoticism: Franz Beckenbauer, Günter Netzer, Gerd Müller, Johan Neeskens, Marius Trésor, Dino Zoff, Ruud Krol. But the hosts weren’t too shabby, either: Bobby Moore, Colin Bell, Alan Ball, Peter Lorimer, Johnny Giles. Moore had been expected to captain, but the armband was tossed instead to Bobby Charlton, a conciliatory gesture, plans for a Wembley benefit for the living legend having been cancelled to make way for this Fanfare fixture.At 35 years of age, Charlton was well over the brow of the hill. He hadn’t played for England since Mexico 70, and would leave Manchester United in April. Not much was expected of him so, well, you know how these stories usually pan out.The Three sported English white, a sartorial choice that would have surely placated Sir Alf, who signally body-swerved all chances to talk up the new landscape of continental cooperation in the pre-match interviews. “All big Wembley occasions should be cherished,” was his pointed take. The Six sported EEC blue. Nothing much happened in the first half, other than on the half-hour, when the Six captain Netzer insouciantly magic-wanded a 30-yard free-kick around the outside of a two-man wall and off the right-hand post. Pat Jennings was never getting there, rooted to the spot in admiration.Three minutes into the second half, the old boy took charge. Regally gliding down the left, slipped clear by Ball, Charlton whipped a cross at medium height to the near post. Henning Jensen of Denmark – later to win league titles with Borussia Mönchengladbach, Real Madrid and Ajax – met it with a cute ing header, angling the ball into the bottom right, giving the future World Cup winner Zoff no chance. Seeing you asked, Jensen’s aerial contortions register a perfect 10 on our patented Keith Houchen-o-meter.Soon after, Charlton drifted down the left again, standing one up at the far stick this time. Bell planted his header wide from close range. On the hour, Charlton’s blocked shot from the edge of the D fell to Lorimer, who sent a low heatseeker twanging off Netzer’s post. Then with 70 minutes on the clock, a satisfyingly all-star cast were involved in the clincher. Giles, Emlyn Hughes and Charlton combined to win a corner out on the right. Lorimer hit the set piece deep. Bell looped it back in from the left. Ball headed down, teeing up Colin Stein to sweep home from close range.The Six offered little resistance – the closest they came to scoring in the second half was when Bell accidentally sent a header looping backwards off his own crossbar – and so the 36,500 crowd went home happy enough. Which is not to say those inside an unusually quiet Wembley, one third full, had been particularly enthused or engaged in the normal partisan style: the biggest cheer of the night came when the PA announced that second-tier Norwich City had beaten Chelsea in the semi-final of the League Cup.So the last notes of Heath’s fanfare were diminuendo. Demand had been overestimated, tickets undersold, and an overall deficit of £25,000 was quietly reported. Meanwhile the Common Market Match was quickly forgotten: Six and Three still resonate in Wembley history, but only because of what Hungary did there 20 years previously. Maybe Johnson is on to something by doing nowt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c1f1004eeb4569c46f4334b047410c26d39c02b/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74dd544d4c1d58b2117f0c7461a4c14","title":"more than half of uk gaming industry based outside south east","story":"Ukie, the sector’s trade body, says there are hubs in more than 20 towns and cities nationwideMore than half of the Britain’s video games industry is based outside London and the south-east, according to a report from the sector’s trade body, with gaming directly contributing more than £1.35bn to the UK economy.The report reveals that the UK gaming industry employs more than 16,000 people. Ukie, the trade body that produced the report, argues that this makes the sector the most productive of all of the nation’s creative industries, with each inidual employee contributing more than £80,000 to the national economy.As well as London’s own games industry, and three other hubs in the south-east centred on Guildford and Heathrow and Gatwick airports, four other development clusters contributed more than £60m to their local economies in the last year: Leamington Spa, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Manchester.The report comes after the prime minister’s promise to focus on “uniting, levelling up and spreading opportunity to every corner of the country”. The video game metaphor is apt, argued Ukie’s chair, Stuart Dinsey.“This report demonstrates how the UK games industry’s regional strength is delivering a hugely positive economic return,” Dinsey said. “Towns and cities of all sizes share in the high-productivity jobs, commercial growth and cultural contribution that our sector offers. While UK games businesses are successful on the global stage, the direct benefits of their pioneering creative work are felt across the country.“The video games industry has an important role to play in rebalancing the economy and creating skilled careers. We look forward to working with government and policy makers to bring the jobs of the future to local communities.”Despite its size, the games industry rarely carries weight in discussions of Britain’s economy. Measuring just the direct value added, the industry generated nearly twice as much value as the fishing industry in 2016, Ukie said.Some of the world’s biggest games come from Britain. Rockstar North, which specialises in blockbuster titles draped in Americana, such as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, is based in Dundee, where its presence has helped spawn a lively indie games community of more than 30 companies employing more than 300 people full time. Major studios based in Leamington Spa in the West Midlands, including Codemasters and Ubisoft, employ more than 900 people working on titles including Tom Clancy’s The Division and racing simulator F1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5540c8ec560949a0832ae89c33ec884dddce0802/0_189_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9add98337e6906065bcc623fe3a038d1","title":"african continent is blind spot the worlds top 10 forgotten crises","story":"Climate emergency is fuelling drought, food poverty and disaster in the global south but humanitarian crises under-reportedMadagascar’s chronic food crisis, where 2.6 million people were affected by drought in 2019, came top of the list of 10 of the most under-reported crises last year, Care International’s annual survey found.Last year, climate activism led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg dominated headlines in the northern hemisphere, but the suffering of millions of people in food poverty caused by global heating in the south was not being covered, according to the research.Nine of the 10 countries in which at least one million people were affected by natural or man-made disasters to receive the least media attention were in Africa, where temperatures are rising at twice the global average, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.“We’re seeing increasing linkages between the effects of man-made climate change and the longevity and complexity of humanitarian crises,” said Sally Austin, international head of emergency operations at Care. “From Madagascar to Lake Chad to North Korea, the majority of crises ranked in our report are partly a consequence of declining natural resources, increasing extreme weather events and global warming more broadly.”“What the report does is to highlight those 10 countries which received the least amount of media coverage. Is this because people aren’t interested in reading about it? Should we be thinking: ‘Is this good enough?’”North Korea and Eritrea, both highly secretive states where press freedom is limited and reporting is restricted, were also on the list.“The increased public attention for the global climate crisis is encouraging, but we must ensure that the conversation is not limited to the global north and much-needed transformations there,” Austin said.The countries with most media coverage of humanitarian crisis were Syria and Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Congo, all countries with ongoing conflict.For its fourth annual survey, Care used the Meltwater group to monitor and analyse 2.4 million online sources, in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic. A list of 40 humanitarian crises in which a million people were affected was monitored from January 2019 until 15 November.The other countries included the Central African Republic, which was ranked second after Madagascar, due to ongoing conflict Burundi, where instability is causing displacement and 1.7 million people are hungry and Burkina Faso, where a quarter of the population, 5.2 million, are affected by escalation of violence.Ethiopia, one of the world’s most drought-prone countries, where 7.9 million people are suffering a cycle of disaster, hunger and displacement due to the reportedly shrinking Lake Chad was also on the list. The report found a correlation between media coverage and funding received: three of the 10 most under-reported crises in the report are also on the UN’s 2019 list of most underfunded emergencies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac755362e60766678d9b1467a23330c70f430cf7/125_489_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f8379134d39c23c9152269a37a48f56","title":"she cant say no the men who take breast milk from babies","story":"A study is looking into the coercive practice in Uganda, amid calls for the government to address the issue Jane’s* husband likes breast milk. “He says he likes the taste of it, and that it helps him in terms of his health. He feels good afterwards,” said the 20-year-old from Uganda, who has a six-month-old baby.Jane said her husband started asking for her milk the night she came home from the hospital after giving birth. “He said it was to help me with the milk flow. I felt it was OK.”Men drinking their partners’ breast milk is not uncommon in some areas of Uganda, and in parts of Tanzania and Kenya. It is now being linked to gender violence and coercive behaviour and there are concerns over the impact on babies’ nutrition. Little was known about the practice until Uganda’s minister of state for health, Sarah Opendi, broke the silence in parliament in 2018 and warned against “a growing culture of men demanding to suckle, which was becoming a problem for some breastfeeding mothers and their babies”.The reasons for the phenomenon, and its consequences, are now the subject of what is believed to be the first preliminary study into the practice, by Kyambogo University in Kampala and Britain’s University of Kent, supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund.“It was very much an exploratory mission. We didn’t know if we would find anybody willing to talk to us who admitted to doing it. We didn’t even really know if it was real or not,” said Dr Rowena Merritt, a British behavioural scientist who specialises in public health, and a lead researcher on the project.The study focused on the rural Buikwe district, in the central region, where the behaviour is reported to be common.Anonymised interviews were conducted with a group of four men who worked as “boda boda” motorcycle taxi drivers.“One said: ‘I know other men do it, but we’ve never talked about it.’ So that to me would suggest that it is a common behaviour, but it isn’t socially accepted,” said Merritt.The preliminary research suggested that men often drink before the child is fed, usually once a day, sometimes more frequently, and for about an hour at a time.The men said they found it energising. “It sustains me, I come home for lunch and it relieves stress in the middle of the working day,” said Thomas*.“There is a belief in some communities that breast milk has energising and curative powers, even curing diseases such as HIV and Aids and cancer,” said Dr Peter Rukundo, a senior lecturer at Kyambogo University who assisted with the research.The men also said it was a way of initiating sex and showing affection. “But then it is happening to women who have just given birth,” he added.One man told the researchers: “When breastfeeding, I feel like I’m being looked after like a child, and this becomes addictive. I feel like a prince.”Women did not seem to have much choice in the matter. “It appears to be a hugely coerced behaviour from the people we spoke to,” added Merritt.When asked what might happen if she said no, one woman replied: “I fear that my husband might go elsewhere if I wouldn’t let it happen.”Thomas admitted that resistance could result in the women being beaten. “She can’t say no because you become obsessed, it’s hard to stop. If women say no it can cause violence, it’s a big issue,” he said.The behaviour has been linked to gender-based violence in the Karamoja region in north-east Uganda. “The principal nutritionist has claimed that it is a common practice there in the form of violence, that when the men get drunk some went for the breasts forcefully,” said Rukundo.Health professionals, including midwives and nutritionists, told researchers about cases where babies had to be given formula milk because partners wanted the breast milk, and where women came to clinic with infected or bitten nipples caused by a man suckling. There are also risks to babies of cross-infection from the man’s saliva.“There is a gap in public awareness of the risks in such practices. But the challenge is we don’t have the evidence of the magnitude of this behaviour. We need a survey on prevalence,” said Rukundo.He also called on government and development partners to work together to mitigate harm. “We don’t have any clear message or deliberate effort, despite the health minister saying the issue is there. So, in a way, it is denial. If they remain silent, the issue will remain underground,” he said.Merritt added: “The fear for me, is the longer that this continues it will become part of the culture and tradition for the next generation. I see parallels with FGM.”*names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c495c46e8bb1264378acf57eb08e084d55307de5/0_358_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4117467d739003588132b5bd74d75ebc","title":"raab incandescent with us conduct over anne sacoolas dunn family","story":"Apparent thaw in foreign secretary’s relations with family after meeting Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, is “incandescent with rage” at the US government’s refusal to grant the extradition of Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat charged with causing the death of 19-year-old Harry Dunn in a crash in August, it has been claimed.The family’s spokesman, Radd Seiger, made the claim after meeting Raab on Monday with Dunn’s parents, including his mother Charlotte Charles. Seiger said he was astonished at Raab’s anger.He said the encounter had convinced him Raab was not going to brush the issue aside when he meets the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on Wednesday in London. Seiger said: “He was incandescent with rage. On a very human level, he is a parent himself, and he made it clear that he is going to tell Pompeo that Sacoolas has to come back. He looked the parents in the eyes and said he was going to demand the return of Anne Sacoolas.”19-year-old Harry Dunn is killed following a collision involving Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official. Sacoolas is believed to have been driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit the teenager riding on his motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. She cooperates with police at the scene and is breathalysed. However, this first account is not treated as an interview under caution.Officers visit Sacoolas’s address, where she provides an account of events and says she had diplomatic immunity. Northamptonshire police apply for a waiver to render this void. The US embassy notifies the FCO that the spouse of a member of staff at RAF Croughton has been involved in an accident.Specially trained liaison officers are embedded with the Dunn family, including parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, and Northamptonshire police’s investigation continues in the belief they cannot detain Sacoolas.The US asserts that Sacoolas is covered by diplomatic immunity.The Foreign Office formally asks the US embassy to waive immunity.The FCO is informed by the US embassy that it will not waive immunity and she will be leaving the country, unless the UK has strong objections. However, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, immediately objects in “strong and clear terms”.Sacoolas leaves the UK on a US Air Force plane.The FCO approaches the US embassy and is informed Sacoolas has departed. It immediately notifies Northamptonshire police that the waiver has been declined and Sacoolas has left the UK. Officials ask police to delay telling the family by up to two days so it can decide next steps.Five days after their son\u0027s funeral, the Dunn family inform the liaison officer they have been made aware of a suggestion that Sacoolas has left the UK. Police confirm this is true.Police meet the Dunn family to officially confirm Sacoolas’s departure, and officers go through what they know.Dunn’s parents visit the White House following an invitation by US president Donald Trump. He surprises them by\u0026nbsptelling them\u0026nbspthat Sacoolas is waiting for them in an adjoining room and wishes to meet them. They decline to meet her.Harry Dunn’s father confronts the foreign secretary in his constituency, where he encourages people to vote Raab out. Video footage of the encounter emerges showing Dunn politely approaching Raab as he arrives for the hustings. The politician claimed he was happy to meet but then dismissed Dunn, adding: “Not right in front of the cameras, it’s not on.”Dunn’s family launch legal action against the Foreign Office which they said could cost them “upwards of £50,000”.Tim Dunn issues a stinging attack on\u0026nbspRaab, accusing the foreign secretary of “empty words” and only meeting the family as a publicity stunt. “We think politicians should be honest and decent, and we feel Mr Raab is neither of those,” he writes.The Crown Prosecution Service confirms it will start extradition proceedings after Sacoolas confirms she will not return to the UK to face the charge of causing death by dangerous drivingThe US state department describes the extradition request as “highly inappropriate”. A department spokesman said: “The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent.”Home Secretary Priti Patel is informed that US authorities will not grant the British government request to extradite Anne Sacoolas. The Home Office describedsthe decision by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, as a “denial of justice”.The thaw in the often frosty relations between Raab and the Dunn family has extended to an agreement that lawyers from both sides will shelve a costly proposed judicial review, and instead meet to discuss the Foreign Office’s initial handling of the case, including how it reached the view that Sacoolas, a wife of an intelligence officer at a US listening base in Northamptonshire, enjoyed full diplomatic immunity.It appears Raab, previously described as cold by the family, convinced the Dunn delegation that he was genuinely animated by the US handling of the case.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, Charles said: “The meeting went really well. You can see the anger in their eyes, faces, expressions and body language and they are definitely not happy at all that this extradition request has been turned down. They have given us concrete assurances they are looking at other ways to overcome the issue, and that they are doing the best they can to secure justice for Harry.”Discussing her relations with the government, she said “there had been an awful lot of dialogue going on underneath the shouting, and we are getting somewhere. The relationship has gone from one of being very untrusting to very trusting. We have come a long way.”Seiger said the Foreign Office was still looking at alternative options including a trial of Sacoolas in absentia in the UK or issuing an Interpol red notice, putting her at risk of arrest as soon as she leaves the US.Seiger conceded there was still a dispute between the Foreign Office and the family over whether she had diplomatic immunity at the time of the crash. “What we agreed yesterday was to try to get the lawyers in a room to see if they can work that out. No one wants a court battle over this. We are all on the same page. Everybody wants that lady back.“The Foreign Office says the issue of her immunity is not relevant and she should still come back, while we are very clear that issue should be resolved so we can say to Pompeo when he comes ‘you are simply wrong’, so that issue is still up in the air.The statement issued by the Foreign Office after the meeting simply said Raab believed the Dunn family suffered a “denial of justice”, a phrase that has been used by Downing Street for the past few days. It argues that the issue of her diplomatic immunity should no longer be regarded as relevant.Ministers are aware that they are facing a well organised campaign, and a deeply emotive issue, but also say that US conduct now means the whole issue of the US-UK extradition treaty has itself been brought into question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296a3ab44ffacb619424569d065741ceabe1d780/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=775958011b2f9514e2f3972f8a6a72c8","title":"detox foot patches want something more effective flush your leg down the toilet","story":"The instructions – literally – make no sense whatsoever. And it made my foot dirtier, more fetid and more slimy than it has ever beenI return to the box, enjoying its mystery. “Attach the side which printed with letters to adhesive paster. (The letters which on the foot patch should NEVER touch your skin.) Attach the foot patch with the paster on to your vola.” A mountain of gibberish, with many unclimbable facets. What is a vola? I can’t see any letters on the patches. I’m guessing this has all been wrung through an online translation engine until it resembles auto-poetry. The final step reads: “Next morning, tear down the bag and clear your.” That’s it. I find it oddly inspiring.One evening, I open the box and regard the 20 inidually sealed patches. I cut one open and shake out a dark, friable substance similar to cremains. Not really sure what is in these: don’t look like no vinegar. Still, here goes. I whack one on to the sole of my foot and wait to be amazed. It is basically a large sticking plaster, and it is obvious how to apply it. Whatever these patches are supposed to do, they will take about six to eight hours to do it, so I go to sleep, awaiting whatever the vola tombola throws up, and dreaming of a world before wellness.I assume this is about more than clean feet. Treating the bottom of the foot as a drainage vent for the whole body makes sense from a reflexological or even gravitational standpoint, if not a biological one. I hope so because my feet are famous for being clean. They never smell. I have other bad qualities – gluttony, cheapness, a tendency to compartmentalise emotions – but it has never been argued my plates of meat are not hygienic. I accept it would be better to have smelly feet and not those other qualities, but that is not my situation.Picture my horror in the morning, then, as I wake to a slightly cramped sensation in my foot, sit up, and peel off the patch to inspect it. O fetid depths! The inside of the patch has turned completely black, and is very sticky. What is this stuff? Have I been injected with fungus? What does it mean? This is … horrible. Unable to breathe under the patch, my foot is sweaty. Worse, the black slime from the pad is now all over my sole. When I walk to the bathroom, I leave a creaturely trail.It is suggested the pad’s blackened appearance is evidence of flushed toxins. Reality suggests otherwise. I boil a kettle of clean water and strap a pad over the spout. Within a few seconds of being exposed to the heat and steam, it has turned every bit as dark. The transformation in this pouch isn’t indicative of toxins in the body unless my diagnosis is chronic limescale. What a load of bullhockey. It would be more effective to flush your leg-end down the toilet.Is there anything positive to say? In fairness, the box is too preoccupied with its own madness to offer any explicit wellness claims, so I can’t say they are a bottomless trough of horse manure. But the description on Amazon does, so I can. The foully transfigured patch does smell weirdly nice: smoky, like a BBQ marinade. On the other hand, this is the dirtiest my foot has ever been. And that is unforgivable. Run away!Patch “flavours” include lavender to relieve fatigue, rose for headaches and ginger for oedema. Maybe I should pour the freshly boiled water over them like teabags.Dark night of the sole. 05 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But although he’s kind and supportive, he doesn’t turn me onMy boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for four years. Two months after we started dating, his mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Devastatingly, his father also developed cancer and both died within two years. We became a serious couple very quickly as a result. We have been through a lot and I love him like family. However, I don’t feel sexually attracted and have always fantasised about exes while having sex. Six months ago, I met a colleague to whom I am very sexually attracted. I have not acted on this, but it makes me worry that I have suppressed needs. My boyfriend is a very kind and emotionally supportive partner but our sex life is failing. We now have sex about once every two months – when we do it is brief and I don’t orgasm.You may think that loving someone “like family” is a positive thing, but when it comes to sex it is not. In most human societies there are strong incest taboos, and these become engaged when a couple becomes too familial. To fix this you need some separation. Start pursuing different hobbies, meeting different people – anything that will help create inidual identities. Once you reach a certain level of iniduality, you may find that sexual attraction will emerge. But it is important to know that bereavement can trigger low libido, and that may be the case for both of you.

Is she too good to be true?Since she began posting rustic-chic videos of her life in rural Sichuan province in 2016, Li Ziqi, 29, has become one of China’s biggest social media stars. She has 22 million followers on the microblogging site Weibo, 34 million on Douyin (China’s version of TikTok) and another 8.3 million on YouTube (Li has been active on YouTube for the last two years, despite it being officially blocked in China).Li’s videos – which she initially produced by herself and now makes with a small team – emphasize beautiful countryside and ancient tradition. In videos soundtracked by tranquil flute music, Li crafts her own furniture out of bamboo and dyes her clothing with fruit skins. If she wants soy sauce, she grows the soybeans themselves a video about making an egg yolk dish starts with her hatching ducklings. The meals she creates are often elaborate demonstrations of how many delicious things can be done with a particular seasonal ingredient, like ginger or green plums.There is even a Li Ziqi online shop, where fans can purchase versions of the steel “chopper” knife she uses to dice the vegetables she plucks from her plentiful garden, or replicas of the old-fashioned shirts she wears while foraging for wild mushrooms and magnolia blossoms in the misty mountainside.While she occasionally reveals a behind-the-scenes peek at her process, Li – who did not respond to interview requests for this article – is very private. By all accounts, she struggled to find steady work in a city before returning to the countryside to care for her ailing grandmother (who appears in her videos).Recently, Li has been thrust into a wider spotlight by the Chinese government, who seem to have realized her soft power potential. In 2018, the Communist party of China named her a “good young netizen” and role model for Chinese youth. In September 2019, the People’s Daily, a CPC mouthpiece, gave Li their “People’s Choice” award, while last month, state media praised Li for helping to promote traditional culture globally, and the Communist Youth League named her an ambassador of a program promoting the economic empowerment of rural youth.As the government increasingly champions her, Chinese citizens have taken to Weibo to question whether Li’s polished, rather one-dimensional portrayal of farm work conveys anything truly meaningful about contemporary China – especially to her growing international audience on YouTube.They have a point: Li’s videos reveal as much about the day-to-day labor of most Chinese farmers as the Martha Stewart Show does the American working class. As Li Bochun, director of Beijing-based Chinese Culture Rejuvenation Research Institute told the media last month: “The traditional lifestyle Li Ziqi presents in her videos is … not widely followed.”So what do Li’s videos reflect about modern China, if not average daily life in the countryside?For one, they say something about the mindset of her mainland audience – primarily urban millennials, for whom a traditional culture craze known as “fugu” or “hanfu” has been an aesthetic trend for a number of years.“Fugu”, according to Yang Chunmei, professor of Chinese history and philosophy at Qufu Normal University, reflects the “romanticized, pastoral” desires of youth “disillusioned by today’s ever-changing, industrial, consumerist society.” In practice, it looks like young people integrating more traditional clothing into their daily looks, watching historical dramas and following rural lifestyle influencers like Li. (While Li is an extremely popular example of the trend, she’s not the only young farmer vlogging in China right now, and outdoor cooking videos of people making meals with wild ingredients and scant equipment are a genre of their own on Douyin.)Among urban millennials in the west, giving up the nine-to-five grind and living humbly and closer to nature is a popular dream. In China, the contemporary experience of burnout is compounded by the intensity of “urban disease”, an umbrella term for the difficulties of living in megacities like Shanghai or Guangzhou, which can be used to refer to everything from traffic jams and poor air quality to employment and housing scarcity.Also at play in Li’s popularity is the particular tenor of Chinese wistfulness. “It’s called xiangchou. Xiang means the countryside or rural life, and chou means to long for it, to miss it,” says Linda Qian, an Oxford University PhD candidate studying nostalgia’s role in the revitalization of China’s villages.Qian also likens Li’s appeal to that of “Man vs Wild”-style entertainment in the west. “We’ve gotten to a certain point of materialism and consumption where there’s only so much you can buy, and we’re like, ‘What other experiences can I have?’” she says. “So we go back to what humans can do.”Yet as her fame grows internationally, some have questioned, in comments, blogposts and Reddit threads, whether Li’s channel is communist propaganda.In addition to providing China a form of international PR, Li embodies a kind of rural success the government hopes to generate more of through recent initiatives. With the aim of alleviating rural poverty, the Communist Youth League has embarked on an effort to send more than 10 million urban youth to “rural zones” by 2022, in order to “increase their skills, spread civilization, and promote science and technology”.“We need young people to use science and technology to help the countryside innovate its traditional development models,” Zhang Linbin, deputy head of a township in central Hunan province, told the Global Times last April.By using technology to create her own rural economic opportunities while simultaneously championing forms of traditional Chinese culture before a huge audience, Li may seem like a CPC dream come true.According to Professor Ka-Ming Wu, a cultural anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong: “Li represents a new wave of Chinese soft power in that she’s so creative and aesthetically good, and knows how to appeal to a general audience whether they’re Chinese or not.” And yet, “I don’t think this is some kind of engineered effort by the Chinese state,” she says.“And I think that’s what really fuels her popularity,” says Wu. “That despair of not being able to find oneself in the ‘Chinese dream’. I don’t think she’s propaganda because one of her major successes is that she’s making that failure highly aesthetic … However, the Chinese government is very smart to appropriate her work and say that she represents traditional culture and promote her.”According to some Chinese media, Li’s content is better than propaganda – doing more to generate genuine domestic, and especially international, interest in rural Chinese traditions than any government initiative of the past decade. “Dozens of government departments with billions at their disposal spent 10 years on propaganda projects, but they have done a worse job than a little girl,” writes the South China Morning Post’s Chauncey Jung, summarizing a tweet from journalist Jasper Jia.However you feel about Li as a cultural force, her ability to flourish despite a unique set of contradictory circumstances is impressive. Out of the past and present, failure and success, independence and authoritarianism, she’s spun a truly pleasant vision. If only life was really so simple."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddca8b7c92101c284312ad650494b76f80eb6c7/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d126af8bc67ba2a2fe80a2ec843387e","title":"question time my life as a quiz obsessive","story":"I’ve taken part in quizzes all my life: in schools, in pubs and on TV shows, from India to the US. But the biggest secret is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. By  Samanth SubramanianLast March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys’ weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team’s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I’ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.Which is saying something, because I’m entering my fourth decade of addiction. In my quizzing, there is to be found a story of my life. It is the single constant to which I’ve clung as I bounced between schools, universities, jobs and cities. In India, where I grew up, my obsession began with inter-school quizzes: teams of two or three, sitting behind desks, fielding questions in turn. When I was eight, I took part in my first, in Delhi. We missed out on winning on a tie-breaker, and for a week afterwards, I replayed that moment in my mind so vividly that I found it hard to fall asleep at night. In 1999, when I went to an American university to study journalism, I discovered Quiz Bowl tournaments, for which we practised once a week, iding up into teams and holding mock-contests in empty classrooms late into the night. I returned to India and, while working as a reporter, sank into the circuit of “open” quizzes, so-called because anyone is free to form a team and take part. Three years ago, after my wife and I moved for a brief stint to Ireland, I joined the Dublin Quiz League, conducted in pubs but otherwise a serious affair with difficult questions.Everywhere I have lived, I have attempted the World Quizzing Championship – an exam-like solo affair held all over the world on a particular June day. Last year, nearly 3,000 people took part. Its 240 questions, to be answered in two hours, are set by a tight group of enthusiasts who run the International Quizzing Association. For much of the year, I begin my days with a dose of six questions emailed to me and thousands of other subscribers of Learned League – an online quiz that solicits new players only through referrals from existing ones, ides us all into small brackets, and pits us against each other. (This morning, bound as ever by honour to refrain from Googling, I answered questions on shibboleths, umami, Assassin’s Creed and Indian princely states, but blundered on Dora the Explorer and surf guitar.) During holidays with friends who are fellow addicts, we’ve sought out pub quizzes: light fixes when we were craving the hard stuff. I wish I could say that we thought of them as dips into the local pub culture of Colombo, or Madrid, or Seattle, or Edinburgh, but we really went just for the questions. Whatever I’m doing at any point of the day, it is probably safe to assume that I would rather be quizzing.We ended up not doing very well in Vegas 100 teams and 25 points separated us from the winner of the $13,000 top prize. It was a reminder of how my quizzing has not only defined my life but has, in turn, been defined by it. Even in our age, when practically all the information in the world is available on our phones, what you know best is often a product of where you have been. In my team were five men who had grown up in India. The sixth, the lone American, had to bear the burden of recalling Tuna Helper, Yoo-Hoo and other snacks from his childhood he was also the one we turned to when we needed to know the number of Canadian teams in the National Hockey League or the name of the country singer Tammy Wynette’s husband. We felt like a basketball team playing with our shoelaces tied together.That we got many answers right nonetheless was the result of a remarkable shift in quizzing culture over the past two decades – another way in which quizzing has closely tracked my life. I started quizzing when I had the sticky memory of a teenager my mind held facts without effort and yielded them instantly. Back in the 90s, quizzing demanded this quality above all else. As I got older, my mind shed some of its retentive powers. But quizzing, too, has changed its questions have come to privilege not just memory but also breadth, deduction and lateral thinking. This new shape was a response to the rise of the internet, and it called upon a truer, more natural form of our relationship with knowledge – of what it means to know the answer to a question.There isn’t even a word for us, really. Quiz players? Trivia fanatics? I prefer quizzers. But when I use that to describe myself to a civilian – to a non-quizzer – the inevitable inquiry follows: “What does that mean?” For that question, ironically, there is no easy answer.The problem is not that no one knows what a quiz is. Quite the contrary, in fact the problem is that nearly everyone has quizzed, or has at least seen a quiz, at some point in their lives. They have caught clips of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Or they have played a multiple-choice Friends trivia game online. Or they have been set a general knowledge quiz in school. Or they have learned to avoid the local pub on Tuesdays, when it hosts Trivia Night in 2013, The Publican, a trade magazine, found that 23,000 out of the UK’s 60,000-odd pubs have at least one quiz a week.Everyone knows how a quiz works: a question asked, an answer ventured, a binary verdict of correct or incorrect handed down, next question please. They suspect that quizzing depends upon an ability to soak up facts: capitals of US states, currencies of countries, names of authors, Academy award winners. Where they flounder is in imagining how something this commonplace can turn into a passion, into a marker of identity. A quizzer? It’s like describing yourself as a doodler or a shower-singer.The most visible quizzes, the ones on TV, are also those that least graze the lives of quizzers. I have been on the Indian edition of Mastermind, and I have friends who have appeared on Only Connect, Jeopardy! and Millionaire. But these were one-offs. The selection process is competitive, and there are too few shows to sustain the ardent quizzer. The most frequent, hardcore quizzing always happens under the radar, attended by the few dozen regulars in each city who never stop wondering why their tribe isn’t larger. For the Dublin Quiz League, we borrowed corner tables in pubs on slow weeknights: a quizmaster and two teams at each table, questions murmured out of earshot of the patrons sipping Guinness at the bar. In universities, Quiz Bowl tournaments requisition classrooms. In Bangalore, quizzes take place in a seminar hall rented from the Institution of Agricultural Technologists during holidays, when there isn’t an agricultural technologist for miles around. So many quizzes happen on Sundays that a passerby peeping into one of these rooms anywhere in the world might take in the hushed conferrals and the gnostic atmosphere and believe that a Christian cult’s prayer meeting is in session.In such quizzes, the material rewards are scanty, often non-existent. You compete for pride, and even that can only be enjoyed within the small, cramped confines of this subculture. The more pathetic the prize, it would seem, the greater the sincere quizzer’s dedication. In Amsterdam, where I once happened to be on holiday on the day of the World Quizzing Championship, I came an all-Netherlands third and won a Jabra Bluetooth earpiece. It is my most sophisticated piece of quiz loot ever. I still haven’t figured out how to sync it with my phone.When I was a member of the Pennsylvania State University Quiz Bowl Club, we would pool our money to rent a car, drive across two or three states and stay in a cheap motel near another university that was hosting a tournament. We would lug along “the Judge” – a buzzer set built into a briefcase, with protruding red and green lights, looking for all the world like a B-movie bomb. (If you brought along your own buzzer, you got $5 or $10 knocked off your registration fee.) All weekend, our squad of four played half-hour University Challenge-style games against other teams, buzzing inidually on 10-point questions and conferring on 30-point bonuses. The scorelines often ran tight, but the real drama was private, internal: the mortification at buzzing wrongly on a question your teammate surely knew the glee at encountering a question your team had come across in practice only the previous week. Nominally, the tournament produced a champion: the team that had won the most games, and that often received just a kitschy trophy for its labours. Come Sunday evening, we would pack up the Judge, hop back into the car, and reach our dorms close to midnight. Sometimes, we would read questions to each other on the way home.In India too, the most intense quizzing events occupy all of a weekend. Quiz festivals, we call them, as if we’re recognising them as rituals in the calendar of some deviant paganism. If you pass through the written preliminary round into the eight-team final, you will encounter some of the most elaborate quizzes on the planet one film quiz I attend every June plays almost 100 minutes of video, short snatches patiently clipped and reclipped to offer a clue or reveal an answer. Across seven or eight quizzes over three days, a quizzer might face as many as 600 questions. By Sunday evening, you feel as if someone has been punching you in the head you also feel deeply sorry that the weekend is over.To attend these contests, quizzers rearrange the furniture of their lives, budgeting their time away from their families, or ensuring that they don’t travel overseas for work during a quiz weekend. I know one quizzer who switched jobs because his city’s quiz scene wasn’t active enough I know another who scheduled his wedding to avoid a clash with a quiz. Once, while we were waiting around for a popular annual quiz to begin, a friend remarked that his wife was heavily pregnant he hoped she wouldn’t go into labour over the next few hours. That would be unfortunate, we agreed.“No, you don’t understand,” he said. “If my daughter’s born today, that means she’ll have a birthday party on this date every year. Which means I can never come to this quiz again.”Admitting to such a fevered love isn’t a good look, I realise. The very premise of quizzing can appear to be a fetishising of book learning: of facts memorised for their own sake, instead of being learned from any true engagement with life. At best, this can feel charmingly antique in the 21st century, when the internet and its infinite electronic lobes do our remembering for us. At worst, quizzers are thought to suck up facts only to win meaningless contests that cater to their intellectual vanities they are typecast as people who have such a transactional relationship with knowledge that they really can be said to know very little at all.But at its finest, quizzing today is never about shallow recall it’s an exercise in nimble thinking, and possibly the only forum where the entirety of your life – everything you’ve ever seen, read, tasted, heard, heard of, or lived through – can be marshalled as pure knowledge. A friend of mine, an English professor in a college in Bangalore, once called quizzing an act of bricolage – a term that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used to describe how even a small number of ideas may be mixed and combined to create something novel and unforeseen. The process thrives on freshness and play, and it holds a sense of limitless possibility – of producing many, many things we never knew out of the few things we do know.The deconstruction of a question is one of quizzing’s high pleasures. Here’s one that I set for a quiz a few years ago. The root word is the proto-Indo-European bhel. Out of this springs a host of related words (in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and also an English word. Strangely, the English word is precisely the opposite of the others. The reason, it has been surmised, has to do with fire, bhel. The words of the Romance languages refer to the brightness of fire, but the English word refers to its final remains. What words are we talking about?The question is designed for teamwork and deductive leaps, not for quick familiarity with proto-Indo-European etymologies. The brightness of fire and its final remains evoke two images: the white heat of flame and the char left behind. They are opposites, most evidently, by virtue of their colours. If the English word describing the char is “black”, then the Romance counterparts must be translations of “white”: blanca, blanc, bianca, branca, all words that might very conceivably have derived from bhel.It’s a difficult question, but I love it for its feat of bricolage – for how it does so much with so little. The foreknowledge potentially required to answer it is minimal: really, just the word for “white” in any one of a number of European languages. You don’t need to speak fluent French or Spanish to have come across terms like carte blanche” or Casablanca, and the merest curiosity about their literal meanings will have yielded all that you require.But with this single key, such a rich universe is unlocked: the evolution of language, and its elemental roots the beautiful, contradictory union of black and blanc: everyday words which, at the slightest inquisitive tug, ulge their history. The answer is satisfying even if you don’t solve it. It has what University Challenge’s question-setters call “inherent interest”, and what Indian quizzers call “funda”, short for fundamental: an easy appeal for anyone, and a burst of joy at encountering an unsuspected elegance in the world.When I was 15 or 16, in 1997, we got our first internet connection at home, and I discovered Quiznet, a mailing list full of junkies like me. You could set a quiz and send it out people wrote to you with their attempts over the subsequent week, and then you released their scores and the correct answers. In my first Quiznet quiz, which included seven questions on cocktails, I asked: “Which cocktail, made of bourbon, sugar and mint, is associated with the Kentucky Derby?” Answer: the mint julep. I had read about the Kentucky Derby in a book I’ve forgotten its title, but the mint julep has stuck.This standard model of quizzing – short, stiff questions, to which you either knew the answer or you didn’t – had been around in India for decades. Its progenitor, in quizzing lore, was a Calcutta man named Neil O’Brien who had spent time in England, grown fond of its pub quizzes and taken the concept back with him. Even when he conducted his first quiz, at a parish hall in 1967, quizzing was a relatively young pursuit, in comparison to the life s of other pastimes. The Romans did not quiz. Neither did the Aztecs. We have no evidence of quizzing in Mughal India or Ming China. It didn’t feature among the parlour games of the 19th century. The Victorians preferred charades or squeak piggy squeak, a variation of blind man’s bluff – perhaps understandably, because at the time, to ask questions about distant countries or art or literature would have presumed an implausible breadth of access to texts and education.The first quizzes emerged, naturally, in schools, where students could be tested on a shared body of knowledge. King William’s College, on the Isle of Man, has wrung answers out of its pupils in an annual quiz that began in 1905. In 1934, the year O’Brien was born, the quiz’s categories included bishops, coinage and literary queens, and its questions already wore the garb of the cryptic-crossword clue for which it later became famous. “Who balked who of his fame ‘with a worm’?” If you didn’t recall that phrase from the 288-line Tennyson poem A Dream of Fair Women, you had only the slenderest hope of responding correctly with Cleopatra and Caesar. This was not a quiz for lackadaisical readers.In the US, the military tested basic knowledge as part of its Alpha examination of recruits. (A 1921 multiple-choice form asked: “The Penguin is a: Bird, Reptile, Insect.” No intimacies with Tennyson were required.) But for a while, as Alan Connor recounts in his book The Joy of Quiz, the purpose of this pursuit remained foggy, if intriguing. The two authors of Ask Me Another!, a compendium of questions published in 1928, thought it a fine idea to quiz celebrities and record their performances, but they were often met with confusion. “I didn’t quite understand just what it was he wanted to do to me,” the humourist Robert Benchley wrote after being approached by one of the authors. The book sold well, but it didn’t seem to spread the love very far. Why would anyone wish to commit such arcane details to memory, reviewers wondered. “A man who treasures up a piece of information like the height of the Brooklyn Bridge has a screw loose somewhere,” the New York World decided.By the time the second world war ended, though, the culture shifted, and quizzing came to be appreciated as entertainment, not imposition. The knowledge “bees” on British radio inspired quizzes in pubs and youth clubs. On US television, shows such as Twenty-One and The $64,000 Question drew rapt audiences. In 1953, US universities also started to compete in a radio programme called College Quiz Bowl it moved to TV as College Bowl and provided the template for University Challenge in Britain, which first aired on ITV in 1962.The questions in Quiz Bowl, College Bowl’s direct descendant, are thickly academic. When I first quizzed at university, I needed a few months to calibrate myself – to get used to dredging answers not out of my recreational reading but out of my textbooks and classroom lectures. But I came to relish the density of the toss-ups – the starter questions, as they are called on University Challenge – and how they unwrap themselves in orderly fashion. A question starts with the most opaque clues: “A wreath of flowers sent to this politician’s funeral is the origin for the name of the Primrose League.” More facts follow midway, perhaps at “He controversially took a loan from Lionel de Rothschild”, there is just enough light and enough material to buzz in with a guess. Certainly at the transparent end – “Name this Conservative prime minister of Jewish descent, the rival of William Gladstone” – we know the answer is Benjamin Disraeli.The delight lies in how certain facts may be obscure to some and immediately clear to others, or how even the same information may be held and organised in different ways by different minds. Once, at a tournament, I buzzed after three words – “President Cheddi Jagan” – and, in wild surmise that the question would ask for a country, ventured: “Guyana”.I was right, but there was no reason for me to have known that – except that, years ago, I’d seen Jagan in a cheesy Unesco advertisement that played throughout the breaks of an India-West Indies cricket broadcast. He appeared above his name and title, offering such a cheesy thumbs-up that I’ve never forgotten him. In the same game, I came up empty while trying to remember the name of the Deccan Plateau – the triangular chunk of southern India, where I lived for much of my childhood. There is nothing to be done about the caprices of memory – but somehow, that makes quizzing more exciting, not less. And it sweetens the sudden, climactic illumination: the microsecond when the brain, acting almost outside your will, pulls the clues together to recognise the answer, as cleanly as if you had known it all along. The quest for that moment is the source of the addiction.There are so many different formats of quizzing that no one can be described as the world’s best quizzer. But Pat Gibson can certainly stake a claim. He’s won the World Quizzing Championship four times. In 2004, he won a phlegmatic million on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in 2006, he won Brain of Britain, the BBC Radio 4 quiz. Today his diet involves three quiz leagues in which his team takes part. “Serious quizzing,” Gibson said approvingly, describing the leagues to me when we met in November. Additionally, five or six weeks a year, he takes the train from Wigan, where he lives, to Glasgow, to appear as an Egghead on the BBC show of that name. The format often requires a challenger to take Gibson on solo. You have to feel for the challenger.Gibson, 58, didn’t properly start quizzing until he was in his early 30s. Growing up in Ireland, he devoured atlases and maps, but he only ever went to one major quiz: the Brain of Ireland, where, as a teenager, he got stage fright and didn’t say a word. After moving to England, he worked as a software engineer, and in the 90s, a colleague roped him into a quiz league. He got so good that, a decade later, he decided to do it more seriously.Gibson has built himself software into which he keys facts that he comes across on some days, he will add as many as 100 facts to his database, culled from books, TV or his perusal of The Times over breakfast. If he is driving and he hears something compelling on the radio, he will pull over and scribble it down in the notebook he always carries with him. He sets time aside for revision. He may decide, next week, that it’s been too long since he brushed up on the Vietnam war, so he will call up the file and study it. He has built files on all sorts of subjects. Sometimes he wonders if he could acquire an appreciation of, say, Ibsen’s plays purely via his Ibsen file, without watching or reading any of the plays themselves.Frequently, Gibson talks about questions as if he were Genghis Khan surveying central Asia: “All those inidual little fortresses, each one begging to be conquered,” he says, practically licking his lips in anticipation. People often assume that his only weapon is his tenacious memory. “Well, yes, remembering is obviously important,” he says, “but it isn’t decisive.” Even after mastering a database, there is no way to know every possible question-answer pair cold nearly always, a quizzer is making a reasoned guess, even when they are certain that their answer is correct. What Gibson values far more than memory is his capacity to submerge himself in a topic. “If you answered a question about Alexander the Great, it’s because you were interested in Alexander the Great, and you read about Alexander the Great,” he said. “Curiosity – there’s a big payoff for curiosity.”Within the philosophy of quizzing, it isn’t easy to define what precisely makes a fact worth retaining. It has to have the ring of novelty, or the tilt of oddity, or the gloss of some human achievement it has to sit at an angle to all the rest of the information that continually laps at our feet. “The number of eggs produced every year in Cambridgeshire – that isn’t interesting to a quizzer,” Gibson says. Unless the number is zero, it isn’t distinctive other counties produce eggs, too, and the statistic says nothing intriguing about Cambridgeshire. On the other hand, on the morning of the day we met, Gibson had prospected a nugget out of the newspaper: that the actor Eddie Marsan has situs inversus, a condition in which the positions of major internal organs are flipped into the opposite side of the body. That only seemed to beguile Gibson into further inquiry. How common is situs inversus? How does the human frame handle this inversion? Who else has situs inversus? The fact went straight into Gibson’s database.Every quizzer practises some such form of information triage. (On my phone, a Notes file is dedicated to gobbets of fact that I’ve come across and want to pursue. The latest entry: “The names of hydrogen and oxygen – Greek for ‘water-former’ and ‘acid-former’ respectively – should actually be reversed. It’s hydrogen that forms acids and oxygen that forms water.”) This habit can make quizzing out to be a kind of intellectual escapism – a constant flight from the big, boring everyday into the eccentric or the significant. But it is, in fact, the opposite. Quizzing invites us to pay extra attention, not only to what we read or watch but also to what is around us. For all its flaws, Slumdog Millionaire got that part about quizzing right. In the movie, Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai’s slums, goes on a hot streak on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, prompting suspicion in everyone. How would a kid like this, with his narrow, limited existence, know the statesman whose portrait appears on a $100 bill or the city in which Cambridge Circus lies? But he had been tipped $100 by an American tourist while working as a phoney tour guide at the Taj Mahal, and he had served tea in a call centre where the clusters of cubicles and their aisles were named after British cities and their streets. That’s how he knew.In less dramatic, Oscar-winning ways, that has happened to every quizzer: an answer pried out of some ancient circumstance, like Cheddi Jagan from a Unesco advertisement. In psychology, episodic memory is distinguished from semantic memory. The first recollects autobiographical events – past birthdays, a first kiss, a car accident – while the second stores facts, like names of cities or Ballon d’Or winners or chemical element symbols. In our minds, during a quiz, these categories don’t feel nearly as separate every slice of episodic memory seems to be embedded with facts that we can pick out, like plums in a pie. During one of his Mastermind runs, Gibson got a question about the USS Pueblo, a spy ship once captured by North Korea. “It was like a Proustian moment,” he said. “In a flash, I was back to being a boy, sitting on the floor of our house in Letterkenny, reading a Reader’s Digest article on the Pueblo.” Even our most secondhand knowledge is tied intimately to our first-hand experiences. If you stay alert and inquisitive, the best preparation for quizzing can be life itself.My time in quizzing has overlapped tidily with the web’s renovation of the sport. Mainly, its effect has been to vastly expand the realm of subjects that might feature in quiz questions. In the US, the more academic style of Quiz Bowl was supplemented in the late 1990s by Trash tournaments, which quizzed students on video games, comic books, pop music and decidedly non-classic TV and cinema. The web held reservoirs of detail about these topics that made it possible to frame sound questions about them in an earlier era, setting a Trash question pack by relying on the library would have been a punishing task.European quizzes grew more capacious as well. “I’ve looked in old quiz books, and the questions are dreadful, frankly,” Jack Waley-Cohen, one of the question editors for the BBC show Only Connect, told me. “There was an assumption that everybody knew the same things.” Now, quizmasters don’t ever ask who the chancellor of the exchequer was in 1973, he said. “For one, someone who is an expert in television or music has an opportunity to demonstrate it, because there are questions on that. But also, the questions I like don’t test absolute knowledge. They test lateral thinking, and your ability to access knowledge.”The greatest internet-driven transformation has occurred in Indian quizzing, where questions have bloomed into intricate puzzles, strewing clues through wordplay, snippets of video, clips of audio, and photos. My morsel about the mint julep would never make the cut today: it’s too dry, too plain. Questions are longer and denser now, and devised to be unlocked in multiple ways, as in the blanc-black case. Logic and teamwork are indispensable. In these quizzes, one may even lavish the compliment “Good answer!” – not for the right response, mind, but for a guess that makes inventive use of the facts provided. The creativity of this style of quizzing, I’m convinced, is also a reaction to the stodginess that infects Indian education. Studying in India involves scant imagination and heavy doses of rote learning examinations admit no such notion as a “good answer”, merely correct and incorrect ones. Just as the internet offered its bottomless resources to those with wide, various interests, quizzing became a canvas to express these interests.The more perplexing issue is that of gender. The subculture tends to be overwhelmingly male – a problem that has been visible wherever I have quizzed, from Ireland to India. Local patterns of sexism might account for some of it. But the universality of this imbalance suggests that the old, male domination of systems of knowledge – even informal ones – is still solid and immovable, like a boulder across a road. As a result, quizzing lays itself open to the accusation that it doesn’t try hard enough to be inclusive, and that it is content largely to be a space into which men can escape to hang out with other men – like poker nights, but for nerds who happen to know why a two-pair of black eights and aces is called a Dead Man’s Hand. (When Wild Bill Hickok, the American frontiersman, was shot in the head during a poker game in a South Dakota saloon in 1876, these were supposedly the cards he held.) For all the quick intelligence that quizzing demands, it can also be slow and witless in avoiding the worst traits of the culture it inhabits.This is unfortunate, because quizzing really is, in principle, among the most equitable of sports. A well-set quiz will not cater exclusively to any inborn prowess. Instead, by being wide-ranging and original, it takes as its premise a powerful truth: no one knows everything, and everyone in the room knows something that the others don’t. Each fresh question is played on a newly levelled field, offering the distinct possibility that the newcomer may beat the veteran to the answer. The guy on the couch never watches Ben Stokes get bowled in a Test match with the certainty that he could have done better. But he might well watch an Oxford team on University Challenge fumble an answer that he knows and be sure that, within that pocket of erudition, he has proven a winner.These inidual triumphs can come about because no two lives experience the world in identical ways. There is something beautifully human about that, just as there is something beautifully human about the very act of remembering – especially now, when we are fast ceding our intelligence to our machines. We don’t always need to remember facts any more, given that we can look them up or store them more and more, we relieve our minds of this duty. But that’s precisely why, in a quiz, it’s gratifying to excavate answers from our memories, as if to prove to ourselves that we are still capable of it. And it feels pure and liberating that this is knowledge stripped of any practical purpose. It has lodged in our neurons not because it has been programmed in to serve a function, as with computers, but because the human brain is an insatiable, indiscriminating sponge.For the moment, too, it appears as if we have this caper of the intellect just to ourselves. The machines are already defeating us at chess and Go, solving mathematical problems, and identifying fake works of art. But as of now, they can only hoard deep reserves of facts, producing one of them when queried specifically for it. They only know what they can store they don’t yet have a way to go from not knowing to knowing, the way we do so unconsciously in quizzing. It is true that, in 2013, an IBM supercomputer named Watson trounced two former champions on US quiz show Jeopardy! But it turned out to be a perverse badge of pride for our species that IBM spent billions of dollars on the machine, deployed it in a quiz show where buzzer reflexes matter as much as answers, and had to discard its brute, fact-crunching approach for an algorithm that sifted hypotheses, appraised language, processed allusions, and made associations. Thinking like a human, it turned out, is still something that humans do better than machines.No other quizzing computers have come forth since. Which isn’t to say that they won’t ever in fact, we may turn into such devices ourselves, if we elect to install the kind of brain-machine interfaces that Elon Musk and others want to develop. I suppose this will be like having a Google search bar in each of our heads, the cursor blinking, ready to ransack every viable bank of information. Maybe the power to know absolutely everything will result in some elevated, as yet unimaginable form of quizzing, but I have my doubts. Quizzing depends too much on not knowing. I don’t mean this in the hard-nosed, free-market sense that only deficits of knowledge can determine winners and losers, or as airy solace that our limitations make us beautiful. I mean that the purpose of quizzing is to discover the answers, to work with meagreness, to build sufficiency out of insufficiency. It is to fashion your own lamp and guide yourself to the truth that black and blanc are shoots with the same root. In this manner, the world comes slowly into focus, question by question.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62715af08e759dbe4679df42b88cacd710a255b7/0_0_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52a3442036f26f73451c9555bab2a0e5","title":"how isabel dos santos became africa richest woman podcast","story":"Dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of the former president of Angola, claims to be a self-made businesswoman, but the Luanda Leaks, a cache of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts, help explain how she actually built her business empire.

The site had been evacuated by the Nazis just days earlier. Thus ended the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. Precise numbers are still debated, but according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1 million to 1.3 million Jews sent to the camp.

The prime minister has said he will not extend the transition period past 31 December 2020. Until then, the UK will stay in the single market and customs union.A leaked internal document from the EU member states, seen by the , notes that without a deal by the end of December 2020, there will be a “cliff edge” in many areas and “no return to the status quo”.Once the talks start in earnest on 3 March, it will be access to fishing waters and the EU’s demand for a “level playing field” that are likely to pose the biggest obstacles to success.The EU does not have a zero-tariff, zero-quota, traditional free-trade agreement with any country in the world. Brussels is demanding guarantees that the UK will not steal an unfair competitive advantage. The bloc has staked out the uncompromising position that the current fisheries arrangements should largely continue.During a visit to Brussels for a meeting of ministers, Amélie de Montchalin, France’s secretary of state for European affairs, said the talks could become complicated if the UK failed to recognise the EU’s red lines.She said: “For us, if there are no clear guarantees vis-à-vis citizens and businesses. If there is no level playing field or fair conditions, the trade openness of the EU will not be total.“The degree of openness of EU trade will depend on the level of convergence we reach. So, if Boris Johnson wants a deal in 11 months with zero quotas and zero tariffs, we must have guarantees of zero dumping and therefore of a level playing field.“It’s a fairly simple negotiation. However, we can make it complicated if we are inconsistent. It is impossible to imagine a completely new trading system in 11 months which would require a different normative framework for each area. It’s not realistic. So we’re going to deal with realistic things.”Brussels’ opening negotiating position will be adopted by EU ministers at a meeting on 25 February. Before then, the two sides will be in “scheduling and scoping” discussions to prepare for the unprecedented negotiation after the end of the UK’s 45 years of EU membership.A senior EU official said the bloc “will be tough on a level playing field”, adding: “We will not budge.” “We might have a conversation about how we keep to a minimum level of standards but we will not move on the need to have them,” the source said.The final political act in the UK’s exit from the EU will take place on Wednesday evening when the European parliament is due to ratify the withdrawal agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89bf03a72d8832b756d082ebcd2dadecf1a51740/0_120_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c885d6656c12ed895b489c39a9eddfa","title":"get ready for brexit campaign had little effect says watchdog","story":"Campaign cost £46m but left public little better informed, say Whitehall auditorsBoris Johnson’s government spent £46m on a “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has found.The National Audit Office said ministers chose to run a £100m campaign – the most expensive of four options – to tell all UK businesses and iniduals how they should prepare for leaving the EU. The campaign was launched as the 31 October deadline for leaving the EU approached. But the evidence shows that the proportion of UK citizens who reported that they had looked or started to look for information, did not notably change, auditors said.The campaign was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave after the EU granted another extension.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.The report increases concerns over the government’s spending leading up to the 31 October deadline set by the prime minister to leave the EU with or without a deal.It comes as the government prepares a new “Ready to Trade” campaign on 1 February, the day after the UK is due to formally leave the EU.Auditors found the Cabinet Office’s business case did not demonstrate increased impact for the proposed spending on the campaign compared with lower-cost alternatives. Auditors said it was “not clear” it left people “significantly better prepared”.Responding to the report, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it was “a colossal waste of taxpayers money” which was effectively part of the Conservative election campaign.“This damning report shows what we knew all along: the Conservative government’s ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ campaign was an expensive propaganda stunt designed ahead of the election to help no one but Boris Johnson stay in Number 10.“Once again the Tories are misusing their powers at the expense of our democracy. Given how poorly this campaigned performed it should be referred to the Electoral Commission and be included as part of the Tory general election spend,” she said. The UK will leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 31 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

There have been warnings from inside China that people may be infectious before they start to feel ill.So far there has been very limited spread from China. A handful of countries have reported cases including France, which has three, and the United States, which had five. This is the first reported European case of transmission from one person to another but it has also occurred in Japan and Vietnam.The vast majority of more than 4,000 cases, however, and all 106 deaths, have been in China and principally in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus emerged and caused a mass outbreak of viral pneumonia.Many governments have brought in screening or other controls at airports for arrivals from China. Countries that have said they will repatriate their citizens in Wuhan, including France, Japan and the United States, are making arrangements to isolate them once back on home soil. Hong Kong has announced major cuts to its transport links with mainland China.The 33 year-old man who has been infected had not visited China, but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had “started to feel sick on the flight home on January 23”, said Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety.The Chinese colleague, a woman, gave a training session on 21 January at the office of the car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria. The man who had attended the session tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he “was doing well”.The Chinese woman sought medical attention when she returned from China and was found to have the virus. She is said to have recently visited her parents in Wuhan. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China “for at least the next two weeks”.The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Health officials are checking 40 people who had been in contact with the two infected workers, recently, including colleagues and family members.Experts said human to human transmission outside China was unsurprising. “We will continue to see further similar cases outside of China, but the indications are at this stage that onwards transmission will be limited, so there will likely not be too many cases for example across Europe, and on a much lesser scale than we are seeing in China,” said Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.But the German case is concerning largely because the virus appears to have been transmitted by somebody without symptoms, said Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia.“The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese cases was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later. The German case is most worrying because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop making standard control strategies less effective,” he said.Symptoms include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties. People are warned to protect themselves by hand-washing, because it can be transmitted in skin to skin contact, and to cover their nose and mouth if coughing or sneezing. In the UK, the advice is for anyone who thinks they may have been in contact with somebody carrying the virus to stay at home by themselves and call 111 for advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f81c45a53b4aa55c852928d897aaaa16bb2a1ff/461_46_1586_951/master/1586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f367876a11d871590a651a55b03aa7b","title":"glare of spotlight intensifies but semi finalist ashleigh barty remains grounded","story":"If she chose, Ashleigh Barty could run for Prime Minister tomorrow and probably win. But the quiet Queenslander with the nation willing her on to become the first Australian to win the women’s title since Christine O’Neill 42 years ago said after reaching the semi-finals on Tuesday, she would rather be “sitting at home, living my quiet little life”.Her growing celebrity neither bothers her nor enchants her. But, if the world No 1 plays the American Sofia Kenin on Thursday like she did in beating the world No 7 Petra Kvitová 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 in building heat on Rod Laver Arena, she will find herself in the full glare of the final. And then the expectations will be off the scale.Kenin, who put the teenager Coco Gauff out in the fourth round, was well worth her 6-4, 6-4 win over the unseeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur in an hour and 32 minutes. She will not find Barty quite so easy, although the Australian had to resist a powerful surge at the start from Kvitová, who brought all her pedigree and experience to the fight.Later she was polite but disinterested when the praise and the prying for a little extra began tumbling her way. Asked about her mum being in her box, she said: “I couldn’t even tell you where she sits. I’m not looking up at her direction. To me, she’s mum. That’s what she is. She wears a million hats for our family. She does the exact same things for me as she does for my sisters. I love her just being mum. I know she gets nervous. I think she has a bit of a fit sometimes when the matches are close.”And as for the plaudits that pile up by the day, she said she does not pay attention to it. “I’d prefer to be sitting at home just living my quiet little life. No offence, but not having to chat to you guys every day would be pretty good. I feel like I have nothing to say. I’m talking in circles a little bit. It’s incredible. It’s a part of the journey that I hate it and I love it.“I’m here to try and do the best that I can. Obviously it’s exciting. Hopefully I can bring a smile to a few faces around our country and around the world. For me, it’s trying to do the best that I can.“Everyone has their own unique path, their own unique journey. I’ve had my ups and downs, but I wouldn’t change mine for the world. Every single experience, the good and the bad, I’ve learnt from. I’ve grown. I was involved in sport from probably when I could walk. I can’t even remember the first sport I was kind of involved in. It was in my blood straight away. There are probably a lot of kids around the nation, around the world that are the same. Some pick it up later in life, some don’t at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7729b696e84e1bc4972f1e60589e06d87bd180/0_74_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86afefd256def85a3455a942c107c0e6","title":"israel folau switches codes again to sign for catalans dragons rugby league","story":"Catalans Dragons have announced the signing of the Australian outside back Israel Folau with immediate effect.The 30-year-old dual-code international, who has not played since being sacked by Rugby Australia last May for making homophobic comments on social media, has signed a one-year contract with the Super League club.Dragons chairman Bernard Guasch said: “We want to give Israel a new opportunity to shine on the pitch.”Wigan responded to the controversial signing by announcing their round six match against Catalans would be named Pride Day as the club look to support the LGBTQ+ community. Warriors say their players will wear rainbow socks and laces for the game on 22 March and will invite LGBTQ+ groups. Wigan executive director Kris Radlinski said: “Here at Wigan Warriors we are committed to the core values of inclusion and respect.“Our community foundation have a long history of supporting local LGBTQ+ groups and initiatives and we want everyone who engages with our game to feel welcome, valued and most of all, respected. Rugby league has a strong history of inclusion, of breaking down barriers and of being a forward-thinking sport. I think that today more than any day that it is vitally important we reiterate that message. We’re looking forward to working with charities, local and hopefully national groups, to make this day a success.”Folau, who played for Melbourne and Brisbane before switching codes, was told he would not be allowed to return to the NRL, but the Rugby Football League has confirmed it will not prevent his registration with the Dragons. A statement said: “This is a difficult decision, as the RFL places a high value on the sport’s reputation in prioritising inclusion and ersity – and deplores the player’s previous comments. However, the moral responsibility for deciding whether to sign a player sits with inidual clubs.“The player has not been charged or found guilty of any criminal offence. However, distasteful his previous comments, we don’t believe that, under our current regulatory framework, these can prevent his participation in the sport.”Folau said: “I acknowledge the views expressed by Super League and the Rugby Football League. I’m a proud Christian, my beliefs are personal, my intention is not to hurt anyone and I will not be making further public comment about them. I look forward to my return to the great game of rugby league with the Catalans Dragons.”Giving his reaction on Twitter, Wakefield’s openly-gay prop, Keegan Hirst, wrote: “I’m shocked and disappointed at the signing of @IzzyFolau. Our great game is tasked with fighting against homophobia and standing up for the values it puts such high stock in. It shows none of the bravery, cameraderie or integrity @rfl expects from its players, staff and fans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14a963fd2c85a776a1cb5afd2d77e0013a83edc/0_174_2200_1318/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c29804c75fce5ad8419453369a08ff0","title":"japan in raptures as outsider wins sumo contest and bursts into tears","story":"The 188kg wrestler Tokushoryu bulldozes his way into the hearts of fans in a sport unaccustomed to displays of emotionSumo fans in Japan are celebrating after the lowest-ranked wrestler beat incredible odds to emerge victorious at the first main tournament of the year.Tokushoryu, a relative unknown until his winning streak at the new year tournament, shoved and threw his way through a succession of “superior” opponents in Tokyo, ending the 15-day contest on Sunday with an unassailable 14 wins and one defeat.The 188kg wrestler manhandled Takakeisho – an ozeki champion wrestler – out of the dohyo ring in his final bout and promptly burst into tears, while the crowd at Tokyo’s Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium roared their approval.“I might have cried too much, but at that moment I felt relieved from all the pressure,” Tokushoryu said of his improbable victory in a post-bout interview, according to Kyodo news agency.“Deep down I’m feeling like, ‘Is it okay for me to win the championship? I was the lowest-ranking fighter, so I had nothing to fear. I just had to give it everything I had.”Tokushoryu’s victory and the emotion that followed drew a positive response on social media, with some users also pointing to his playful side.One Twitter user wrote: “He was so emotional. One moment he was laughing, the next he was crying. And he was really blubbing. I’m going to keep cheering him on.”Another said: “I was so impressed … it was a tear-stained win over Takakeisho and everyone in the stadium was captivated.”Tokushoryu, who held the lowly rank of No. 17 maegashira going into the tournament, became the first bottom-ranked wrestler to win a top-ision sumo title since March 2000.He later said he had been inspired by the death, midway through the competition, of his university coach. “I thought I should do it for him,” he said.The 33-year-old, who had spent the previous 13 tournaments fighting in the ancient sport’s second tier, is also the first wrestler from Nara, in western Japan, to lift the prestigious Emperor’s Cup for a century.His heroics, along with displays of emotion not usually seen in the conservative sumo world, captivated fans more accustomed to watching titles go to elite wrestlers, including the Mongolian-born yokozuna grand champions Hakuho and Kakuryu, who both missed the Tokyo tournament due to injury.A day after his achievement, Tokushoryu was still struggling to keep his emotions in check when asked how he had managed to put on one of the most extraordinary displays of sumo for many years.“What have I done?” he said. “It feels like a dream. I don’t feel like myself. I feel like I’m walking on clouds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f6f37e88812d167cd73076f0faa7fd29858b176/0_102_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5a9c09dd9a9716c4450001a9b34e94d","title":"kobe bryant greatest american athletes tiger serena lebron","story":"The NBA great exists at the summit of the American sports pyramid, in the rare mononymic air of Tiger, Serena and LeBronGrowing up in Philadelphia, I can remember exactly where I was the first time I heard Kobe Bryant’s name. It was the last day of a summer basketball camp and the director invited a handful of the local high school stars to play a scrimmage in the afternoon as we watched, hoping to pick up some pointers. Most of them were headed to college in the next few years on their way to the NBA and were basically living our dreams.But it was the skinny 15-year-old from Lower Merion High School that had all the older kids buzzing in the cafeteria. He’s not even going to college, they said. He’s going straight to the league. Even back then, I knew enough to know it all sounded a bit far-fetched.Then Kobe took the floor. And immediately we realized we were watching something special. As the next few years went by, it became obvious he was bound for great things. We stole away on a school night to watch him face future NBA champion Richard Hamilton in the state playoffs and gossiped enviously when he took pop star Brandy to the prom. Over the next two decades, we watched as the basketball prodigy with the impossibly polished game from our corner of the map became, almost inevitably, a larger-than-life figure in world sport.Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday aged 41, was ruthless on the court, which likely only magnified his personal faults. But once we confront the fallacy that athletes are role models and not something that marketing departments created to sell more sneakers, we can soberly assess just where Bryant stands in the pantheon of great American athletes.The short answer is at the very top, in the rare mononymic air of Tiger, Serena, LeBron.Bryant played the entirety of his 20-year professional career in Los Angeles for one of the NBA’s blue-ribbon franchises. Some of the biggest names in the history of basketball have suited up for the Lakers down the years, including Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal and LeBron James. But only Bryant, of those names, spent his whole professional career in the purple and gold, winning five NBA championships and retiring as the team’s all-time leader in at least a dozen statistical categories.Tim Duncan, who also won five rings in a career that almost entirely overlapped Bryant’s, was the better player, but a self-effacing introvert with a workmanlike game toiling in a small-market San Antonio could not approach the star wattage of Kobe, a slashing wing player with made-for-Hollywood charisma who came to embody the link between Michael Jordan and LeBron in the NBA’s lineage of incandescent alphas.Bryant’s detractors knocked him as phony and image-obsessed. His on-court presentation seemed to be a deliberate carbon copy of Jordan’s (easier said than done!), from the performative mean-mugging to the switching of uniform numbers. There was his weird penchant for self-coined nicknames: like Black Mamba (which stuck) and Vino (which went the way of fetch). To critics, he came off as a bit of a tryhard, which made him a perfect fit for how most of America sees LA.But there was nothing inauthentic about Bryant’s intensity. He was probably the hardest worker in sports. Often it is supporting players who are praised for getting the very most out of their talent, but Bryant was an example of a supremely gifted athlete hell-bent on squeezing every last drop from his natural gifts, propelled by a maniacal competitive streak that wouldn’t have been out of place on Wall Street in the 80s and often led to flare-ups with cooler-tempered teammates, most infamously with Shaq.He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated no fewer than 20 times (when such appearances still mattered) and became one of the rare sporting figures to genuinely transcend the sports pages in the US and become a household name. His international popularity may have even exceeded his standing at home as he became an crucial figure in elevating the sport’s global profile. Michael Phelps may have won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics, but Kobe was the star of those Games on the ground.The last time I saw Kobe was at last year’s US Open when he came to watch Naomi Osaka, whom he had taken on as a mentor. It was the first time I realized he was going to have a major impact on women’s sports and was making an attempt to evolve as a person beyond the basketball ability that had been undeniable from day one. For a sportsman whose future seemed preordained from his earliest days, it’s a pity the outcomes of his promising second act will be left unknown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f2a5a300eb639c7e1f441f6d629d579553f9ee/0_109_3406_2043/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6624a9ca986872a3528fd6706a1e3f9b","title":"share your views on sports banter in the workplace","story":"Do you feel sports banter in the office excludes people?

It is day four of the final Test between England and South Africa and, as chief groundsman, all he can do is watch as Rassie van der Dussen and Dean Elgar grind out the beginnings of a doomed rearguard action.Flint has been at the Wanderers since last spring, lured north after 10 and a half years at Newlands, where he won groundsman of the year during his last two seasons. He had had a lot to cope with.In January 2018 Cape Town officials announced that, after three years of insufficient rain, the city was three months away from Day Zero (running out of water). The visiting India team were told not to shower for more than 90 seconds, the India and South Africa sides gave a combined donation of 100,000 rand to the Gift of the Givers Foundation (disaster relief in Africa), fights broke out over water from the nearby Newlands borehole and club and schools cricket was cancelled halfway through the season.Three weeks before Day Zero, Australia and South Africa played a Test in Cape Town – subsequently overshadowed somewhat by the discovery of sandpaper down Cameron Bancroft’s trousers.Newlands is well served by boreholes but Flint remembers it as a difficult time: “We were in the thick of it but it was an opportunity to show the rest of the world that we were doing our bit, almost like a badge of honour.”He had to water the pitch it has a very high clay content so otherwise would have cracked, but the outfield was something else. “At one point we were watering it maybe twice a week at most and it was very brown. It looked terrible but the last thing we wanted as Day Zero approached was for people to put on the telly and look at a lush cricket field.”“You know what people are like, they announce water restrictions and nobody believes it, so it was a personal decision to adhere to what the authorities said. We used borehole water but we acknowledged there was a drought on and we were playing our part.”“It made me realise that the grass doesn’t need as much water as we think. It taught me that you are doing the turf a bit of a disservice to spoon-feed it every day. I learned that it is when you water that’s important, rather than how much.”Day Zero was eventually averted but sport in South Africa is under strain in a volatile changing climate. Temperatures in the interior of the country are rising at twice the global level according to the International Panel on Climate Change and southern Africa as a whole is facing unprecedented strain. The UN World Food Programme has warned of a hunger crisis on “a scale we’ve not seen before”, blaming, largely: “The cumulative effects of climate-related natural disasters in the form of recurrent widespread droughts. The region has had only one normal rainy season in the past five years amid cyclones and persistent flooding.”Malawi has also had to contend with an influx of fall armyworms, while further north plagues of locusts currently swarm over Kenya.In South Africa the Eastern Cape is still under severe strain, with many of the new boreholes not producing the desired results because ground water levels are so low, a situation the government has called critical.Level 2 water restrictions were announced in October, even in Johannesburg, but the big difference for Flint as a groundsman is the summer rainfall in Jo’burg – in Cape Town the rain falls, or should fall, in the winter. Nor does he miss the south-easterly wind that hits Cape Town from the spring: “They don’t put that in the brochures.”The Wanderers also has the benefit of wonderful ground irrigation, every drop of rain that falls on the stadium roof or gutters runs into a reservoir at the back of the ground to be stored away.The changing climate – declining rainfall and temperature changes – has made Flint question some of groundskeeping’s most cherished ideals. “Cape Town was an eye-opener,” he says. “We have great water harvesting at the Wanderers because we are an international ground but certainly a lot more could be done in council and club facilities and there should be more research into artificial surfaces because they don’t require the maintenance, the cutting and the fuel, etc.“Of course many municipalities have got greater things to worry about but more education would help. I say this with this beautiful turf in front of me, and professional sportsmen want to play on grass, but artificial surfaces do make sense. I’m being really sacrilegious now but think about golf courses. The enormous amounts of water those things guzzle is extraordinary.”Despite all this, the climate crisis is not something that Flint finds crops up in conversation much, either in cricket or groundskeeping circles. “It’s been a bit disappointing. We meet up once a year as groundsmen and we discussed the Cape Town drought but, apart from that, not really. Once it starts raining, people go back to their own ways. But if you don’t have any water, my goodness, you can’t live.”• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email. The Spin.

Now he’s embracing his heritage in the deeply personal family drama LeopoldstadtIt must be a nightmare. You’re invited to discuss your distinguished acting career, but the interviewer keeps asking about your dad. It should rankle but Ed Stoppard responds with good grace. After all, he’s rehearsing a new play by his father. I apologise for banging on about Sir Tom. My excuse is that Ed is central to the vast ensemble in Leopoldstadt, the 82-year-old Tom’s achingly poignant piece tracing a Jewish Viennese family during the first half of the 20th century.His verbal dexterity and gift for infusing complex ideas with tenderness seem ideally suited to his father’s work, but this is only their second professional encounter (following a West End revival of Arcadia in 2009). Oddly, both characters are mathematicians (“I like playing characters whose heads are busier than most”), though his A at maths A-level only goes so far. “When I looked into number theory – which Ludwig is studying – it was completely baffling.” More pertinent is Ludwig’s passionate curiosity. “There’s probably a part of my dad’s brain that is interested in the actual mathematics,” he suggests, “but what probably interests him as much if not more is the emotion it arouses in its practitioners.”Does he hear his father’s voice in the writing? “It’s not exactly the same, but there is a rhythm and cadence, maybe sometimes even an emphasis.” He admires its stealthy craft, too. “I’m sure I’ve heard him use the phrase ‘lobbing grenades’ at the audience – they don’t see them arcing through the air until they explode at their feet.” He laughs when he recalls an actor who checked with Tom whether he was supposed to make a particular line funny, only to be told, “Don’t worry, I’ve done it for you.” Ed reflects: “If you could only give one note to actors doing a Tom Stoppard play, that wouldn’t be a bad one.”Fingers raking his salt-and-pepper beard, he confides: “Listen, the truth is I don’t find it very easy, my job. I’m very self-critical.” He had admiring reviews for his Hamlet in 2005 and The Glass Menagerie, alongside Jessica Lange, in 2007 – plus The Pianist and Upstairs Downstairs on screen – but perhaps imposter syndrome still lurks. Has that surname been a blessing or burden? “It was an albatross for me, which ties into beating myself up.” He recalls a director wondering, mid-filming, if Ed’s dad might “just cast an eye over the script” and admits: “It didn’t help that for years I would walk on to film sets and people would call me Tom. Initially I found it excruciating. Now I roll my eyes.”In childhood, his first name was the curse. Ed is short for Edmund – he was named, he tells me, because his pregnant mother (doctor and TV presenter Miriam Stoppard) noticed the poet and critic Edmund Gosse’s name on the spine of a book. When did he truncate to Ed? “Oh my God, when I was like five. As young as I dared. I didn’t want to be in any way exotic at school.” Later he fleetingly dreamed of recasting that surname for professional purposes. “There was about a day and a half where I thought: Ed Straussler. That’s a pretty fucking good name.” It was his Czech grandfather’s surname.Research could start closer to home – there are, Stoppard admits, “resonances” with his forebears. Czech rather than Austrian Jews, the Strausslers fled just as Hitler invaded. “For people who know my dad’s biography, there’ll be one character where they’ll go, ‘Ah, there’s the author.’ My dad is quite insistent that it’s not. But it sort of is though, isn’t it?”Tom has also resisted being described as a Jewish playwright. Does his son feel like a Jewish actor – especially in this play? He exhales a perplexed snuffle. “It’s a good question, and one I haven’t asked myself. I would be lying if I identified myself as Jewish, day-to-day. I was brought up in a completely secular household – although my mother’s parents, who were very observant, came to live next door when I was about seven or eight.”He gets muddled about whether they held the sabbath meal on Friday or Saturday evenings and barks with frustrated laughter. “Jesus! There you go, that tells you all you need to know. I am a terrible, terrible Jew. But doing this play, I’ve never felt more connected to my heritage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca38a0a0a011e0054746cf2df629e8be327b1d39/0_0_3885_5524/master/3885.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=30692ad9c9e3ba49f6c518ddf4fc6539 2020w","title":"low on emissions high on ambition meet generation net zero","story":"From transforming the energy networks to sharing surplus food, young millennials and Generation Z workers are putting the planet at the heart of their careersWhen Navneet Dharni, 25, was looking for her first job, she knew she wanted something different. “I didn’t want it to just be business as usual,” she says. “I have a passion for tackling climate change and reducing my carbon footprint and I want to make an impact.” For this reason, Dharni applied to work at National Grid, where she is currently on their 18-month graduate scheme. “The organisation is transforming the energy network to power a cleaner, greener Britain and I want to be part of the change,” she says. “That’s what motivates me. I care because it’s my future.”Many young millennials and Generation Z are passionate about tackling the climate crisis, research shows. They also want to work at organisations that have a strong commitment to sustainability.Across the UK, young people like Dharni are working to create a healthier planet. For example, Sadie DeCoste, 23, is an analyst at E Co, a London-based consultancy, which works on low-carbon, climate-resilient projects. DeCoste says she’s always been interested in sustainability. “I’ve been really passionate about it since high school,” she says. “I find it meaningful and interesting.”Dharni and DeCoste both point out that young people have grown up in the internet age, seeing the impact of the climate crisis around them. “People our age care because we’re more educated on the subject,” DeCoste says. A recent report warned that 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by climate change impacts on natural disasters and agriculture by 2030 unless precautions are taken now.For this reason, many young people want to make a difference through their work. “If you’re going to spend such a big part of your life working, why wouldn’t you try to maximise your impact?” DeCoste says.McConnochie believes there’s only so much he can do as an inidual and wants to achieve more than that. “I’m a realist, I believe that as an inidual there’s only so much of an effect you can have. So taking up this role has allowed me to have the most influence outside of my personal actions. I’m able to work with some of the biggest housing associations and to start seeing some real significant change within them.”Other young people are founding their own companies or working at startups that offer alternative ways of doing things. Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, 22, works at Olio, a startup that connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, rather than thrown away. “I started at Olio in April and it’s been a wild ride,” she says. “I’m having my mind stretched by all these problems and solutions.

To see the world anew.The mountains of the UK and Ireland offer unique environments for adventure, exploration and nature connection. Over the years, I have had many amazing experiences in the remote wilds, but there are risks: paths are rarely signposted and weather can change quickly. Go out without the right skills, knowledge or equipment and things can soon turn deadly serious.Heather Morning, mountain safety adviser for Mountaineering Scotland, says: “A quick look at the accident reports from Scottish Mountain Rescue highlights a very modern issue – people’s inability to navigate well, and an over-reliance on modern technology. Traditional navigation skills using a map and compass are still essential for safe travel in the mountains.”In November, regarded as the end of the “summer season”, I did the mountain leader course that gave me the skills and knowledge needed to keep myself and others safe. Taught over six days, it covers navigation, group management, access and the environment, hazards (including steep ground and rivers), emergency procedures, equipment, expedition skills, weather and background mountain knowledge. Once you have completed it, honed your skills and gained the required experience, you can go on to do an assessment to qualify as a mountain leader.Mountain leader training is for adults who have at least a year’s worth of mountain walking experience and an interest in leading groups. A basic level of fitness is essential: you must be able to manage six days’ walking in mountainous terrain, with one overnight expedition carrying camping packs.My course was led by two highly experienced mountaineering instructors, Richard Bentley and Jon MacRobert. Under their eagle eyes, I headed out into the mountains around Fort William with four other trainees: a schoolteacher, an outdoors instructor and two locals.The snowline was at around 700 metres. Richard and Jon planned routes carefully so that we stayed within remit (ice axe and crampons are not allowed on summer mountain leader courses). While Ben Nevis and the highest summits of Glen Coe were out, we found plenty of interesting peaks and knolls on which to practise all the skills required of a mountain leader.Over the week, my navigation sharpened through focused map work, using compass, pacing and timings. I learned to read contours through my feet to estimate distance by feeling my pace to match lumps and bumps on the ground to orange squiggles on Ordnance Survey maps. We plotted routes using storytelling techniques, examining maps and creating sequential lists of features to run through like an Indigenous Australian songline. We moved on steep ground in Glen Coe, learning to keep each other safe on scree and boulder fields, and practised river crossings in Glen Nevis, wading through icy water that seemed to get colder each time I crossed.We finally crossed together in triangle formation and with each icy step, my feet screamed. Earlier in the week, Jon had asked us, “How do you cross a river?” We offered various answers. They were all wrong. He was looking for the simplest: “A bridge.”One day, we watched the sunset from a summit. A golden eagle glided past. The light faded and a deer herd ran across the breast of the hill, antlers silhouetted against evening sky. Darkness came fast. We dug out headtorches for a three-hour stint of night navigation, stumbling over grass hummocks and tripping through frozen bog as we made our way down to wild camp.This was our overnight expedition. We needed to find somewhere sheltered from the north wind, where the ground was soft enough to take tent pegs and the burns were not frozen. We headed for an old shieling (hut) in a glen and found running water and space for four tents.Waking in the night, I gazed up at the Milky Way and watched a shooting star plunge down to the horizon.I would recommend mountain leader training to anyone who wants to build their skills and confidence in the mountains. Fears that I would feel out of place – a woman in a macho world of hardcore mountain men – were unfounded. The course is not about “beasting it”, but a week of supportive tuition in the mountains. Richard and Jon created a welcoming atmosphere, helping us to hone a huge range of skills without judgment or criticism.Throughout our trips into the hills, the instructors paused to point out plants, birds and animals. I discovered that there are three main species of heather in Scotland (common, bell, and bross-leaved Heath) and, by the end of the week, I knew how to identify each one.I left exhausted but inspired, brimming with enthusiasm to put my new skills to use.Rucksack (30-40 litres, and possibly a larger one for the expedition)Good walking bootsWaterproof jacket and trousersGood thermal layersThermos flask for hot drinksPacked lunches each dayCompass (preferably a Silva type 4 or similar)MapcaseHeadtorchHat and two or three pairs of glovesTentStove, pots and pansSleeping matSleeping bag• Book mountain leader training courses through Mountain Training they are available from National Training Centres (like Plas y Brenin in Wales and Glenmore Lodge in Scotland) from £300-£450, accommodation not included.

She has also appeared in Fleabag, Batman Begins and first came to prominence in the early 2000s playing Natalie Crouch in the BBC One sitcom The Crouches. She posted a picture of herself in costume as the Doctor on social media after the show aired on Sunday night – having kept her new role secret for months. Reaction to her arrival was spontaneous and joyous – the production team had managed to keep the surprise entirely under wraps.And after just one appearance, Martin’s incarnation of the Time Lord has already begun to inspire fan art.The casting, though, isn’t as straightforward as announcing her as the new Doctor to succeed current Doctor Jodie Whittaker. Her character was revealed to be a previously unknown version of the Doctor hiding on Earth disguised as a human tour guide called Ruth Clayton. Pursued by the Judoon as a fugitive, Clayton and Whittaker’s Doctor travelled to a remote lighthouse to discover Martin’s Tardis buried underground as her memory was restored.Fans have since posited several theories of how Jo Martin’s Doctor could fit into the show’s established history:In a Tardis scene where the two Doctors sparred with each other over their costumes, neither Whittaker nor Martin claimed to recognise the other – raising the possibility that Martin’s Doctor comes from an alternative dimension. This season’s opening story Spyfall set up the idea that there were possibly multiple versions of Earth being invaded by an alien species called the Kasavin, and at one point Whittaker’s Doctor appeared to be transported to their dimension. Perhaps she didn’t make it back to the right universe?There’s a gap in on-screen continuity between the Second and Third Doctors. In his last regular appearance in the role, Patrick Troughton was forced to change his face as a punishment by the Time Lords. In the next episode, we see Jon Pertwee’s Doctor fall unconscious out of the Tardis. Crucially, though, we never see Troughton actually morph into Pertwee. It is possible that Martin’s Doctor fits in here – although the fact that she didn’t recognise the sonic screwdriver, as first used by Troughton’s Doctor, suggests otherwise.There are rumours that there may be a whole host of Doctors we’ve never encountered before, who lived before the William Hartnell Doctor. The theory goes that some cataclysmic development had wiped his memory, leading him to forget his earlier selves, and to live believing he had never regenerated before.The clues are there. Martin’s Doctor referred to the Tardis as “the ship”, as only Hartnell used to, and the design of her Tardis is very similar to the iconic version that was first seen on screen in 1963.The show has previous in terms of introducing unknown past versions of the Doctor. John Hurt memorably guest-starred in the 50th anniversary special as a grizzled elderly version of the character who had rejected the name “Doctor”.Other fan theories have suggested that she can’t be the Doctor at all – Martin’s character has just found a way to disguise herself, thereby fooling Whittaker’s Doctor into thinking they are the same Time Lord. Several villains from the past might be able to achieve that – the Master, possibly, or the Rani, who hasn’t appeared in Doctor Who since 1993.This could even signal the return of the Valeyard – a twisted evil version of the Doctor who appeared as Colin Baker’s main adversary in the 1986 story Trial of a Time Lord. Fans have long yearned to find out the fate of this amalgam of all the Doctor’s negative traits who was said to be somewhere between the Doctor’s twelfth and thirteenth incarnations.But showrunner Chris Chibnall has said there are no tricks. “Jo Martin is the Doctor, that’s why we gave her the credit at the end which all new Doctors have the first time you see them. John Hurt got that credit.”Plenty of significant characters in Who history – the Doctor’s daughter Jenny, granddaughter Susan, Clara and Maisie Williams’ immortal MeAshildr – have waltzed off the show, leaving us wondering what happened to them, and never appeared again. Chibnall appears to have ruled out John Barrowman returning as Captain Jack again this series after his cameo at the weekend, and has hinted that this year’s season finale might not tie up all the themes of the story arc just yet, saying: “There will be answers to some of these mysteries this series. But as ever with Doctor Who, answers often reveal new questions.”Doctor Who continues on BBC One on Sunday with the episode Praxeus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b49a0e9335fa12faac0fff2fa5926538c7f39d/0_30_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8d83bc5e6641e7f0343cf076274c61","title":"rita tushingham interview taste of honey shock 60s","story":"She caused outrage as a wide-eyed teen in her very first film. As the actor returns in a spooky Agatha Christie, she relives life as a 60s icon – and the taunts she endured in the streetOne day nearly 60 years ago, Rita Tushingham was walking through Soho with her friend, the late British actor Paul Danquah, when a passerby yelled: “Blacks and whites don’t mix!” Tushingham looks troubled by the memory. “It happened to Paul a lot,” she says. “I remember he shouted back, ‘Don’t worry! She’s only been on holiday and got a tan.’”That was Britain in 1961, before London swung, before sex between men was decriminalised, before a black man and a white woman walking in Soho might pass unremarked. There’s a photo in the National Portrait Gallery of the pair that very year, her leaning in care-free, him eyeing the street as if on alert for the next racist. At the time, Tushingham and Danquah were filming the now-celebrated A Taste of Honey, adapted from the play by Shelagh Delaney. “It had everything – race, class, gender, sexuality, poverty,” says Tushingham of her first film role. She played something cinema had never seen before: a bored teenager from the rough end of Salford. Jo was alienated from school, revolted by her boozy single mam and eternally suckered by worthless suitors. After falling in love with a sailor, played by Danquah, Jo gets pregnant. He returns to sea, so she moves in with Geoffrey, a gay textiles student who becomes her surrogate co-parent.“We shocked audiences without intending to,” says Tushingham. “I only learned later that Paul and I did the first interracial kiss on screen.” It’s a big claim: certainly, it was seven years before Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Uhura kissed in Star Trek, and a year before the earliest known interracial kiss on British TV, in the ITV drama You in Your Small Corner. For this and other supposed outrages, A Taste of Honey was banned in several countries including New Zealand. “A lot of the reaction was, ‘People like that don’t exist’ – by which they meant homosexuals, single mothers and people in mixed-race relationships. But they did.”Not only did Tushingham win a Bafta and a Golden Globe, her haunting looks became iconic. Delaney wrote A Taste of Honey when she was 19. Tushingham was 17 when she played Jo, getting the part after replying to a newspaper ad. “I quit as assistant stage manager at Liverpool Playhouse,” says the actor, who had been earning £1 a week and getting the occasional walk-on role. “Then I was wide-eyed in London, not quite believing what had happened to me.”When the city started to swing, the former convent girl joined in, albeit mutedly. “I’ve never smoked or drunk alcohol, so I observed.” Danquah introduced Tushingham to a struggling artist called Francis Bacon. She met Elizabeth Taylor, too, and hung out with pop stars. On stage, she played Nancy in The Knack and Hermia in A Midsummer Night’s Dream. On screen, she starred in 1963’s cult gay film The Leather Boys and was the eponymous Girl with Green Eyes in the adaptation of Edna O’Brien’s novel. A New York Times reporter who met her described her as “a slip of a girl, her uncosmeticised face framed in straight dark hair, wearing a sweater and jeans, with those enormous eyes incessantly expressive even when the rest of the small face disappeared behind a big yellow coffee cup”.Across the decades, those eyes – now behind glasses as she sips a decaf latte in a demure dark suit – still captivate. Tushingham became the go-to girl for doe-eyed innocence, playing the daughter of Julie Christie and Omar Sharif in 1965’s Doctor Zhivago. In The Trap the following year, she played a mute living with French-Canadian fur trapper Jean La Bête. She was the orphan beauty, Oliver Reed the rough-hewn beast whose leg needs amputating. “I didn’t have any lines, but I did cut off Oliver Reed’s leg with an axe!”Tushingham also starred in Richard Lester’s film version of The Knack. The 1965 sex comedy is rather painful to watch now. Michael Crawford plays Colin, a sexually frustrated teacher who meets innocent but feisty northern girl Nancy, played by Tushingham. She helps him and his womanising drummer friend Tolen bring a huge new bed to their flat. There, Tolen makes advances on Nancy and tells her: “No one’s going to rape you – girls don’t get raped unless they want it.”Worse is to come. Later, Nancy faints and when she comes round falsely claims she was raped – and slashes the tyres of Tolen’s motorbike. She runs back to the flat and strips naked. Then she emerges in a robe, giving the impression it’s Colin she really fancies. She won a Bafta and a Golden Globe, while the film took the Palme d’Or at Cannes. But the levity with which the film treats rape, not to mention Nancy’s weird hysteria, is bound to make modern audiences a little queasy.“I’m always taken to task for that aspect of the film,” she says. “After a screening not long ago, one German woman said, ‘Why do you think rape is funny?’ I don’t at all. Obviously. I can understand why people were offended, though.” But the film is meant to be funny? “Of course it is! One thing I learned from Richard was to play comedy straight.”As the 1970s dawned, roles started to dry up. Gamine was so last decade. “I thought the 60s in London was normal, so when it stopped it was a shock.” She found work on the continent, playing Alice B Toklas, partner of Gertrude Stein, in an Italian film called The Legendary Life of Ernest Hemingway. She had two daughters, Aisha and Dodonna, by her first husband, the photographer Terry Bicknell. She later married Iraqi cinematographer Ousama Rawi, spending eight years in Canada with him before they separated. Tushingham then lived with German writer Hans-Heinrich Ziemann. Today she lives alone in London, near Aisha and her grandchildren.We’re meeting because Tushingham, who turns 78 in March, will soon be back on our screens. “I keep looking at the obituaries and see my friends have died,” she says. “But I still seem to be going.” We will see her later this year in Last Night in Soho, Edgar Wright’s follow-up to Baby Driver. She is also starring in a thriller called The Owners, about two broke friends spurred by a sociopath to rob an elderly couple. “It spirals out of control,” she says, “and I’m caught up in the middle of it.”Best of all, we will see Tushingham next month in Sarah Phelps’ adaptation of The Pale Horse, Agatha Christie’s 1961 novel. She plays Bella in the BBC production, one of a trio of uncanny women from the Surrey village of Much Deeping. They may or may not be witches, and they may or may not be killing off the lovers of adulterous antiques-seller Rufus Sewell. “What people call witches may be nothing of the kind,” she says. “I’m not interested in pointy hats and broomsticks. When I lived in Cornwall, there was a woman who knew about potions and read tea leaves and would deliver babies. Was she a witch? Is my character a witch?”She doesn’t answer, which is sensible because part of the mystery is whether these three women really do have magical powers. It’s a subject that clearly intrigued Christie. In her novel Nemesis, Miss Marple imagines staging the witch scene in Macbeth. “I would have them three ordinary, normal old women,” Marple muses. “They wouldn’t dance or caper. They would look at each other rather slyly and you would feel a sort of menace just behind the ordinariness of them.” That is precisely the menace we feel from Bella and the other two when Sewell spies on them in one scene. They turn round as one and stare in his direction in an utterly sinister gesture.Has she ever played a witch in Macbeth? “Don’t say that word!” she exclaims. “When I was at Liverpool Playhouse, we’d say the Lord’s Prayer to get rid of the curse.” A proper thesp. But the question goes unanswered.The Pale Horse is set in 1961, the year of Tushingham’s break into stardom. But instead of A Taste of Honey’s kitchen-sink dismalness, the era is depicted in sumptuous colour, all sharp suits, svelte frocks and fag ash in the vol-au-vents. Racism has been airbrushed away but the leering, thwarted sexual mores of the time endure. “Ever been to Much Deeping?” Sewell’s character asks a chum. “No, but it sounds pornographic, so I’m all in favour.”Tushingham sports a huge grey wig and rustic straw hat, and deploys a stern mien while eloquently skewering Sewell’s claims to be a rational man. “We’re all rational when the sun’s shining,” Bella tells him. “Different when it goes dark.” Never before have those eyes been so chillingly deployed. “That’s so right, isn’t it?” she says with a laugh. “The darkness is something we’re all afraid of. And rationality isn’t everything.”Tushingham has one big regret: the fact that her mooted directorial debut hasn’t yet been made. Victory Girls would have told the story of a group of women working in a first world war munitions factory in Preston. They start a football team to raise money for the war effort, but get banned by the FA. Why? “The men came back from war on Friday and the women were out of work on Monday.”The story appeals to Tushingham as a lifelong football fan now revelling in the triumphs of Liverpool under Jürgen Klopp. Surely, with women’s football on the rise, it’s time for this story to be told? Her eyes light up as she flashes that bewitching smile. “I’d love it to be,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c642385b102ab6fb2c5b2b622a72e7b8656975/0_70_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c73e78b718c4edfa1afa51fddd6c7728","title":"jared kushner israel palestine peace plan","story":"Trump calls his son-in-law’s proposals – which will be presented Tuesday – the ‘deal of the century’ for Israel and PalestineWhen Jared Kushner took on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict alongside his many other official duties – promoting American innovation, arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the US opioid crisis – he decided to begin with a blank slate.“He said flat out, don’t talk to me about history,” said Aaron David Miller, a US peace negotiator for previous administrations who was consulted by Kushner. “He said, I told the Israelis and the Palestinians not to talk to me about history too.”This was a daring approach to a conflict and region steeped in every bitter turn of history. During one of a handful of meetings, Miller reminded the president’s son-in-law of William Faulkner’s observation: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past”.Kushner decided to deal with the problem of history intruding on talks by engineering a proposed settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis without negotiations or even really talking to one of the parties.“I think Jared has a real conviction that he’s the Frank Sinatra of the peace process. He’s going to do it his own way,” said Miller.The result is the “deal of the century”, as Donald Trump described it, that the president is expected to formally present to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on Tuesday. But enough details have leaked for the proposals to be widely scorned as favouring Israel by opening the door to its annexation of large parts of the occupied territories and giving it almost total control of Jerusalem.Trump appointed Kushner, a developer who is married to the president’s daughter Ivanka, to oversee the US’s policy on Israel and Palestine even though he has no experience of Middle East diplomacy. But Kushner does happen to have close family ties to Netanyahu who is facing an election in March.The make up of Kushner’s team was an early clue to where it the process was headed. It included David Friedman, a lawyer with close ties to the Jewish settler movement in the occupied territories who Trump appointed as US ambassador to Israel. Friedman has questioned the need for a Palestinian state and likened members of a liberal US Jewish group to Nazi collaborators for their criticism of the Israeli government’s actions.The Trump administration then alienated the Palestinians with a series of actions in Israel’s favour including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and slashing funding for Palestinian refugees. Kushner toured Middle East capitals seeking to get the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and Egypt’s authoritarian president, to pressure the Palestinian Authority into going along with the White House plan.Among those wooed by Kushner was the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, which goes some way to explain – alongside arms deals – why the Trump administration has let him off the hook over the murder of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Miller was sceptical of the process even before the administration soured relations with the Palestinians.“I said to Jared you’re not going to fix this because the problem is not the United States. You can make it worse but you’re going to have a hard time making it better because what needs to be done can’t be done by the United States. It requires fundamental decisions by the Israelis and Palestinians. Neither side is prepared to make them. They lack leaders who are capable of making them,” he said.Miller, who met with Kushner a handful of times and describes him as very respectful, said the president’s son-in-law has indeed made it worse. But he concluded that the process has not been driven by a desire for a negotiated settlement so much as to bolster the prospects of Netanyahu’s re-election – because that helps Trump’s prospects of holding onto the White House.“It is tethered to a set of political and personal objectives which in my judgment have little or nothing to do with creating a realistic and sustained negotiating process,” he said.Miller noted that Kushner will be running Trump’s re-election campaign and that a plan that helps get Netanyahu re-elected by giving Israel a green light to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank will in turn help the president not least with the Christian evangelical vote which is very supportive of the Jewish state.“I told Jared you’re going to put out a plan that meets the needs or requirements of only one side. And I said that’s a serious problem because American credibility and integrity is also on the table. Not just American politics and re-election of Donald Trump,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802dc2132d1bdad53277fe34cb49a3616efa2edc/0_165_3211_1926/master/3211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8724af5d739cf06a21627bd88432089","title":"china mask producers work overtime to meet coronavirus sparked demand","story":"Video emerged on Monday showing people clamouring for masks at factory in Jiangxi provinceChinese companies are working overtime to produce masks amid soaring demand caused by the country’s coronavirus outbreak.Five of the 12 main mask-producing companies based in Guangdong province have resumed production after pausing for the lunar new year holiday, the business publication First Financial reported on Tuesday.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 27 January, the Chinese authorities had acknowledged more than 2,700 cases and 56 deaths. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have not been any confirmed cases in the UK at present, with the more than 70 people tested for the virus all proving negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal.

It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.Guangdong has implemented a province-wide order for everyone to wear masks in public places or face unspecified fines. Videos have circulated of unmasked metro riders being ejected forcibly by security staff.Search stats on Baidu, China’s main search engine, revealed there had been 2m queries for the term “not wearing masks can get you fined” as of Tuesday morning.On Monday, footage emerged showing a scramble for masks at the gate of a factory in Jiujiang in Jiangxi province.Of more concern is the ability to get masks and other medical supplies to hospitals and medical staff in quarantined areas of Hubei, the province where the outbreak began. A report from People’s Daily on Monday indicated that masks were in short supply at Wuhan’s No 7 hospital.Patrick Brogan, a Briton who has been in Wuhan since 10 January and is now stuck, said there were shortages of masks there but that his girlfriend’s father was able to pick up a box before supplies dwindled.“We are using scuba goggles if and when we have to go out again, it’s better than nothing,” the 30-year-old from Reading said. Meimei, from Shenzhen, who did not want her full name used, said she had been trying to order masks from the US through online shops such as Amazon to distribute to people across China, but supplies are running short there too.The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.“It is difficult because California is having a very severe flu season,” she said. “I heard that many others are asking friends abroad to buy masks but it is very difficult.”Meimei said she had heard supplies to Wuhan were improving but that other areas of Hubei were short.Shenzhen Airlines dispatched a flight to Wuhan with about 100 medical personnel and 10 tons of medical gear on Tuesday, according to Meimei, who is friends with one of the cabin crew on the flight.The Australian government has told doctors and staff at GP surgeries to wear face masks when seeing patients who may be carrying the virus, and said it was prepared to use a national stockpile to make sure there are enough to go around.Jin Wei, a Chinese student studying in Melbourne, told the  he and several of his friends had bought masks to send home to family in China. “It is still possible to buy the masks online, but many of the outlets in China are running out of stock,” he said.Wing Kuang, a Melbourne University student from China, said many pharmacies in the city had run out of masks when she tried to purchase some last week.Despite all the concern about masks, Dr Maia Majumder, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School who has studied Sars and Mers outbreaks, has said mask use is not as important as many people are making it out to be, particularly for most healthy people.“Surgical masks, however, are wise to wear for those who’re exhibiting respiratory symptoms or those who live with people who do.”Additional reporting by Else Kennedy in Melbourne"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153308.1580200203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plans to evacuate irish citizens from china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedical workers in protective gear talk with a woman suspected of being ill with  the coronavirus at a health station in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, on Monday.

It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media. One poster warned the community in Ireland, and in particularly Chinese restaurants, to “be aware” of their presence.Surgical masksMedical suppliers are reporting a big jump in demand for surgical masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China, with some Dublin stores saying they have run out of stocks.Demand has been particularly high among the Chinese community, especially from those who travelled home to mark the Chinese New Year at the weekend.The Department of Health said its National Public Health Emergency Team met on Monday to review the ongoing preparedness of the Irish health system for any cases of the virus that occur in Ireland. A statement gave no details of the group’s deliberations but pointed out that no confirmed cases had occurred here.Waterford Institute of Technology said one of its students was in self-isolation after travelling from Wuhan at the weekend.

The move comes after issues were raised with lift equipment at MOT test centres.The faults forcing the near-closure of all MOT centres came out of the blue, an official has said.Cracks in vehicle lifts were first detected in November but the problem rapidly escalated this month.Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) in Northern Ireland, ordered the halting of most tests on Monday after failing to receive adequate assurances about repairs.Julie Thompson from Stormont’s Infrastructure Department said: “This has come out of the blue.”By earlier this month signs of cracking were detected in 48 of 55 lifts.Taxis and four-year-old cars are being prioritised for roadworthiness tests following the partial shutdown at test centres.Heavy goods vehicles and buses are continuing to be tested because they do not involve use of lifts.Infrastructure committeeMs Thompson told Stormont’s infrastructure committee: “Yesterday came as a big shock, the fact that the supplier said they did not have sufficient assurance over the repairs that were in place.”She said the parties involved need to learn lessons for the future to prevent the problem from recurring.Sinn Féin committee member Raymond McCartney said: “If you bought a new car and there were 48 faults within a short period you would be back to the supplier saying this is not the car I bought and it is under warranty.“Forty-eight lifts, all cracked – there is a design fault or something.“People will ask questions as to why it was not picked up earlier.”Damage was detected on the scissor arms of the lifts, which were installed in 2011 or 2012, Ms Thompson said.She added the department might have to buy new equipment.“When you are in a position whereby this has never happened before, this is very fluid and very recent.”MoT exemption certificates lasting four months will be issued to those affected so motorists can continue to drive.They cannot be created for four-year-old cars or taxis. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153848.1580218061!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catherine noone apologises for calling leo varadkar autistic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael Senator Catherine Noone said her choice of language was ‘inexcusable and wrong. I am truly sorry’. File  photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsFine Gael Senator Catherine Noone has apologised for calling Taoiseach Leo Varadkar “autistic” during an election canvass this week.In a statement released this morning, Ms Noone said she wanted to “unequivocally apologise and withdraw all of my remarks...which were completely unacceptable”. She said her “choice of language was inexcusable and wrong. I am truly sorry”. Ms Noone, a General Election candidate in Dublin Bay North, was quoted in this morning’s edition of The Times Ireland edition as having said of Mr Varadkar: “He’s autistic like, he’s on the spectrum, there’s no doubt about it. He’s uncomfortable socially and he doesn’t always get the inbetween bits”.The Times Ireland edition reported online this morning that she had initially denied having made the comments, before being told there was a tape of her saying them. In her subsequent statement released on Tuesday morning, in which she apoligised, Ms Noone said she would not be making any further comment.Ms Noone is a running mate of senior Fine Gael Minister Richard Bruton. She chaired the committee on abortion before the referendum. She was a former running mate of Mr Varadkar in Dublin West in the 2016 General Election. Mr Varadkar, asked about Ms Noone’s comments on Tuesday, told reporters: “I haven’t spoken to her yet. I’m sure I will over the next couple of days. She has withdrawn her remarks and apologised. That’s good enough for me. “But it’s not about me. We all need to very aware and very respectful of people who have autism, people who are on the autism spectrum, that those terms should never be used in a pejorative way at all.”Meanwhile, the autism awareness group AsIAm has urged people not to engage in “doorstep diagnosis” of autism.Speaking after Ms Noone’s apology, the deputy chief executive of the autism advocacy and support organisation As I Am, Fiona Ferris, has said that an apology from Fine Gael candidate Catherine Noone is not enough.Ms Ferris described the comments as “quite shocking” and it was “completely unacceptable” to the autistic community for the word to be used as “a descriptor” or an adjective.Autism diagnoses only comes after an extensive clinical process, she told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show.Autism was not something that should be used to describe someone, she added.Ms Ferris said she did not accept the apology issued by Ms Noone who should “fully educate herself what autism is.”Autism is not an illness it is a condition, she explained. It was of great concern that a political representative thought it was acceptable to use the word as a descriptor. Doing so was trying to justify the stereotype (of lacking empathy) of what it means to be autistic. This was a misconception as some people with autism were too empathetic and suffered great distress as a result.ReactionReacting to Ms Noone comments, Minister of Health Simon Harris tweeted: “Autism should never be used as a slur or a negative. 1 in 65 people can be on the Autistic Spectrum - including someone I know and love dearly. As a society we need to become much more aware in relation to Autism and not use casual stereotypes.” Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath has strongly criticised the comments of Catherine Noone. “They were ill-informed and extremely damaging to a section of Irish society”, said Minister McGrath. “People with Autism are a part of Irish society and should always be treated as equals in line with the UN Convention for the Rights of Persons with a Disability”, said McGrath.“... I accept Ms Noone’s apology but we will need to focus on our new Autism Plan which will deliver an awareness raising campaign, a national training programme for clinicians and improvements to the assessment process.”During the Virgin Media debate, Mr Varadkar responded to criticism from some quarters that he sometimes appeared to lack empathy on issues such as health and the homelessness crisis.He responded by telling host Pat Kenny: “I care about this country. I probably can’t put it into words as well as my opponent, but I do it with my actions...I show my empathy in the work I do, maybe I don’t say it in the right words.”The Times Ireland article said that, asked about the issue while canvassing in Bayside last Friday evening, Ms Noone described Mr Varadkar as a “very good politician” but said he was “a bit wooden” and was making efforts to improve.“He’s autistic like, he’s on the spectrum, there’s no doubt about it. He’s uncomfortable socially and he doesn’t always get the inbetween bits.”‘Extremely bright’The Fine Gael leader was “extremely bright” and a “very decent guy”, she added.“If I do say so, I am much more natural than he would be. I’ve been in rooms with him and he doesn’t know what to do with himself. He’s naturally shy. But he’s actually a very good politician.”She added: “He’s not into the nudge and wink, any of that craic. If you’re looking for him to appoint someone, and you say ‘they’re a Fianna Fáiler’, he’ll say, ‘I just want the best person for the job.’ I really respect that about him.”According to The Times Ireland, when contacted for clarification of her remarks on Monday, Ms Noone initially denied that she used the word “autistic”, but when informed a recording existed, she said she did not mean the word literally.“I didn’t mean it in the sense of the actual illness or anything. I just mean he can be a bit wooden and lacking in empathy,” she said. “I shouldn’t have even said it in that way.”The Times Ireland quoted Ms Noone as attempting to give examples of potentially offensive words that could be used out of context, such as “special” and “n***er”. She quickly clarified that she would never use the latter word and said that it was a bad example, The Times Ireland said.Ms Noone argued that her comment had been taken out of context. The Times Ireland reported she said: “Sometimes I say, ‘Oh God, I’m a bit special’ but I don’t mean it to be derogatory.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153817.1580198793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 galway debate sees no outright winner emerge","story":"Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin over their inidual economic records during a televised RTÉ leaders\u0027 debate.

Photograph:  Daniel Leal-OlivasAFP via Getty ImagesBoris Johnson’s UK government has put itself on a collision course with the US after approving the limited use of Huawei technology in the UK’s 5G telecoms networks.The UK National Security Council gave the go-ahead to Huawei on Tuesday but has limited the Chinese company to a market share of 35 per cent and will exclude its equipment from the sensitive network “core”.The decision came despite repeated warnings from the US that allowing Huawei equipment into the UK 5G rollout would put Britain at risk from spying by the Chinese company.However, in a concession to White House concerns, ministers have agreed to work with partners in the Five Eyes alliance of the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand to develop alternative telecoms suppliers. The ultimate aim is to have “no high-risk vendors in the system”, according to officials briefed on the meeting.The NSC has also stipulated that Huawei will be banned from sensitive sites such as nuclear power stations and military bases. In a statement, officials said the measures taken would enable the UK to mitigate the potential risks posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, “whether cyber criminals, or state sponsored attacks”.Nicky Morgan, UK digital and culture secretary, said that world-class connectivity “must not be at the expense of our national security”.Ciaran Martin, head of the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of GCHQ, said he had issued advice to telecoms network operators “to help with the industry rollout of 5G and full fibre networks”.The decision sets up a confrontation with Washington, which has consistently warned that allowing the Chinese company to play a role in 5G infrastructure would compromise British sovereignty. US officials have said that Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing as a “back door” to spy on UK communications.US warningsUS secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who is due to arrive in London for talks with Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, on Wednesday, said ahead of the announcement that the NSC faced a “momentous” decision. Senior administration officials have threatened that a post-Brexit trade deal could be compromised if the UK went ahead with Huawei technology.While the US has also warned that the deal could prevent intelligence-sharing between Britain and its Five Eyes partners, Andrew Parker, director-general of MI5, told the Financial Times earlier this month he had “no reason to think” this would be the case.Of the Five Eyes nations, Australia has already bowed to US pressure by completely banning Huawei from its 5G networks but Canada and New Zealand are yet to reach a decision. It is thought they may follow Britain’s lead.Huawei welcomed the UK government decision, saying it would keep the rollout of 5G technology on track.“This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market,” said Victor Zhang, Huawei vice-president.A number of senior Conservative MPs expressed concerns about the prospect of a Huawei deal in the House of Commons on Monday.Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative party leader, said it was “utterly bizarre” to be considering giving Huawei the go-ahead, while Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, warned that the UK would be “allowing the fox into the hen house” if it struck a deal with the Chinese company. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Politics latest news: MPs react to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s decision to allow Huawei to help develop 5G networkHong Kong to close borders with mainland China as global alarm spreads over coronavirusSyrian forces \u0026#39target civilian cars trying to flee fighting\u0026#39 in rebel-held IdlibNetanyahu charged with corruption hours before Trump unveils Israeli-Palestinian peace planIndia to reintroduce cheetahs to the wild more than 70 years after species extinctFrance to ban controversial practice of slaughtering male chicks in 2021Huawei will be allowed to build parts of Britain’s 5G networkDuchess of Cambridge visits children\u0026#39s hospital as part of commitment to early years provisionCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Tears of Japanese sumo outsider melt conservative wrestling world after shock tournament winBoris Johnson should reduce salary threshold for migrants who want to enter UK after Brexit, says reportComment: Hong Kong\u0026#39s coronavirus panic reminds me of the dark days of SarsBrexit deal: what does it mean for you?How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?

Yet the Duchess of Cambridge, in her series of moving photographs of Holocaust survivors, walks this tightrope with perfect ease, drawing attention to the lessons of history whilst preserving political neutrality. In one fell swoop, she has shown us that the Royal Family is in safe hands.After an election campaign that was riddled with talk of anti Semitism and reports of yet another hate crime shortly after Christmas where a Hampstead synagogue was daubed in anti-Semitic graffiti, the Cambridges could have been forgiven for deeming this issue too politically sensitive to address. As the Duchess prepared to publish these photographs, she must have had one eye on the negative press garnered by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for speaking up on topical issues like climate change and feminism. But this makes her support of such a significant anniversary all the more brave and pertinent. Many in the press have remarked on the double standards to which the two Duchesses are held. Supporters of the Duchess of Sussex have pointed out that the Cambridges have unfairly avoided many of the criticisms that have been levelled at Meghan and Harry. But it’s worth considering why it is that, in this instance, Kate has managed to wield her influence with such subtlety and good sense - because it’s a model other royals would do well to follow going forward.The answer lies in her canny use of art. The focus of her photographs is on the human stories that lie behind the Holocaust and the imagery within them unravels slowly the more you study them: the inclusion of personal items such as a pan used in a concentration camp and a tomato grown in a survivors’ garden puts the focus squarely on the survivors’ experience and its relevance to the present. Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust, pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright, aged 11The Duchess has cited Vermeer’s paintings as a key influence and it’s not hard to see why: like Vermeer, her images make a feature of the natural light which, symbolically, comes from windows which are positioned to the east to evoke Jerusalem. Kate’s careful use of symbolism demonstrates how she has chosen to show rather than tell. As she reveals her artistic side to the nation, she would surely approve of Anton Chekhov’s sentiment: ‘Don’t tell me the moon is shining, show me the glint of light on broken glass.\u0027Her example paints a clear picture of how the royals can operate in future – lending support to the issues that count in a manner that, rather than seeking to be pejorative, opens up an opportunity for national reflection and discussion. The events of January have laid bare the frustrations that come with royal life. There must be times when the desire to have your say on a subject is overwhelming, especially when life as a working royal brings you into such close contact with some of the most pressing issues facing modern Britain.But Kate has demonstrated that royalty does not confine you to a life of silence. In fact, the restrictions in which she has to operate have led her to create a much more restrained and self-effacing statement than any politician attempting to denounce the rise of anti-Semitism has managed.There’s a rich history of artists in the royal family – from Prince Charles to Queen Victoria and her daughter, the Duchess of Argyll. But the Duchess of Cambridge’s new photography is a bold departure from the safe watercolour landscapes of previous generations. Let’s hope this isn’t the last we see of Kate the artist.  Duchess of SussexDuchess of CambridgeDuke of SussexPolitics latest news: MPs react to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s decision to allow Huawei to help develop 5G networkHong Kong to close borders with mainland China as global alarm spreads over coronavirusSyrian forces \u0026#39target civilian cars trying to flee fighting\u0026#39 in rebel-held IdlibNetanyahu charged with corruption hours before Trump unveils Israeli-Palestinian peace planIndia to reintroduce cheetahs to the wild more than 70 years after species extinctFrance to ban controversial practice of slaughtering male chicks in 2021Huawei will be allowed to build parts of Britain’s 5G networkDuchess of Cambridge visits children\u0026#39s hospital as part of commitment to early years provisionCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Tears of Japanese sumo outsider melt conservative wrestling world after shock tournament winBoris Johnson should reduce salary threshold for migrants who want to enter UK after Brexit, says reportComment: Hong Kong\u0026#39s coronavirus panic reminds me of the dark days of SarsBrexit deal: what does it mean for you?How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?

So far, the city has reported eight infections from the new Wuhan strain. Carrie Lam, the city’s embattled chief executive, whose popularity is already at an all-time low from eight months of pro-democracy protests, eventually buckled to widespread political pressure and public demands to limit transit from the mainland.The announcement comes after the number of infections in China soared overnight by nearly 60 per cent to more than 4,500. Health workers spray disinfectant in a South Korean bus station The virus, which is believed to have begun in a seafood market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the central Hubei province, has now spread to all provinces bar Tibet, prompting unprecedented lockdowns of multiple major cities, and severe curbs on transport systems and public gatherings. After it emerged at the weekend that the ability of the deadly coronavirus to spread is becoming stronger and it can infect people even if its carrier shows little or no symptoms, the UK has joined other countries, including the US and Japan, in a desperate scramble to evacuate their nationals. Nick, a dual US and UK citizen who is teaching English at an international school in Wuhan, told The  that the streets are eerily empty as most people are staying inside to try and avoid catching the coronavirus. “We\u0027re all washing our hands every five minutes, he said. But he said that he and his Indonesian wife and two children, 12 and nine, who have British and Indonesian citizenship had barely heard from the UK government, despite contacting them several times.  By contrast, the Indonesian government had been amazing at keeping in touch with his wife with developments and advice. Quick spread of CoronavirusIt really is frustrating, we just don\u0027t understand - England is supposed to be a powerhouse of world diplomacy, he added.Over the weekend, China has urged its citizens to postpone trips abroad but millions had already embarked on trips for the Lunar New Year or on business in the weeks and days before Wuhan was completely sealed off. So far Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection, Hong Kong eight, Taiwan, seven and the US, Australia and Macau five each. Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia have reported four, France, three and Canada, Germany and Vietnam two. Over the past day, Cambodia has announced one. Singapore, Germany and the US Centre for Disease Control are advising all-but-essential travel to China should be avoided. Germany’s two cases were identified as employees of Munich car parts supplier Webasto. Neither had travel links to China but they had picked up the virus from a meeting with a Chinese colleague who had visited from Shanghai and had no symptoms at the time. Dr Emmanuel Andre, a practicing doctor and professor of medical microbiology at KU Leuven University in Belgium, told The  this case would have a lot of consequences on approaches to contain the coronavirus. The important element here is that the disease can be transmitted through asymptomatic people. This means many of the measures we are taking, which are based on screening of symptoms and of people coming from China, are not sufficient,” he warned. Airport staff disinfect a plane at Bangkok airportJust as China is having difficulties controlling the disease, we may well have more problems in Europe, he added. The Ivory Coast is also investigating Africa\u0027s first potential case of the coronavirus. Dr Andre said he was surprised the new disease had not yet reached the continent. Many countries in Africa are super-connected with China. Over the last 20 years we have seen a huge increase in communication and China has invested millions in the continent.  In a similar case to Germany, Japan said on Tuesday that a man with no recent travel to China had contracted the virus after driving tourists visiting from Wuhan.The man in his sixties from Nara in western Japan drove two groups of Wuhan tourists earlier in January and was hospitalised on Saturday with flu-like symptoms, the health ministry said.Japan has imposed new checks on travellers arriving from China, and is planning to dispatch a plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate around 200 Japanese nationals from the city.Coronavirus | Opinion and analysisThe rapid infection rate has increased pressure on the World Health Organisation to declare a global health emergency rather than just an emergency for China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, who is currently in China for crisis talks with officials and health experts, said on Tuesday that he is confident in China’s ability to control and contain the virus, adding that he did not support the evacuation of foreign nationals.  But the WHO position has left some experts flummoxed. Dr Mark Eccleston-Turner, a lecturer in Global Health Law at Keele University, said the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern would be a “crucial step” in assisting China. “The legal criteria for a PHEIC have been met..The reasons for this not being declared a PHEIC are unclear, and do not align with the international legal obligations found in the International Health Regulations,” he said. Meanwhile, national capitals have been rolling out their own escalating precautions to protect their citizens. The Philippines stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals on Tuesday, while officials in Russia\u0027s Far East closed border crossings with China and travel agencies said they have stopped accepting package holiday makers from China.Taiwan, which announced its seventh case on Tuesday, has prohibited Hubei residents from visiting the island and will impose a two-week ban on Chinese students planning to go to Taiwanese universities.  Syrian forces \u0026#39target civilian cars trying to flee fighting\u0026#39 in rebel-held IdlibPolitics latest news: MPs react to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s decision to allow Huawei to help develop 5G networkNetanyahu charged with corruption hours before Trump unveils Israeli-Palestinian peace planIndia to reintroduce cheetahs to the wild more than 70 years after species extinctFrance to ban controversial practice of slaughtering male chicks in 2021Huawei will be allowed to build parts of Britain’s 5G networkDuchess of Cambridge visits children\u0026#39s hospital as part of commitment to early years provisionCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Tears of Japanese sumo outsider melt conservative wrestling world after shock tournament winBoris Johnson should reduce salary threshold for migrants who want to enter UK after Brexit, says reportComment: Hong Kong\u0026#39s coronavirus panic reminds me of the dark days of SarsBrexit deal: what does it mean for you?How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world is watching to see if the UK and the EU can overcome the political hurdles around Brexit and secure a deal that makes economic sense.\u0026nbsp“With European economies facing significant economic headwinds, it is vital that policymakers keep a sharp weather eye on wider European competitiveness, and seek to maintain open and unfettered access to global capital markets through Europe’s primary international financial centre in the UK.”Separate research conducted by ZYen found that New York overtook London as the world’s top banking hub in September 2018 and extended its lead last year.Despite the increasingly bleak sentiment about London’s future, its financial sector is still expanding at a healthy clip, at least on some measures.The UK’s net exports of financial and related professional services grew by around 5 per cent to an estimated £82.8bn in 2018, up from £79bn in 2017.\u0026nbspIn currency markets, London has consolidated its dominant position, accounting for 43 per cent of global foreign exchange revenues last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no clear message we are getting from them other than to leave, which is impossible,” he said.The city was visited by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the most senior official to journey to the epicentre of the disease.In NYC’s Chinatown, it’s business as usual despite coronavirusMr Li, who travelled to the region to encourage medical workers attempting to stem the spread of the virus, could be seen on state media leading a crowd in chants of “Wuhan jiayou”, a turn of phrase that calls on the city’s residents to keep their spirits up.However, away from official media channels spirits were lower and frustration was aimed at those in charge. In particular, citizens took aim at Mr Li’s address to residents after he corrected himself twice on the number of face masks being produced for the region.“If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely,” said one user of the Weibo social media platform.In a rare public show of self-criticism, the city’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, said Wuhan’s handling of the crisis was “not good enough” as he indicated that he was willing to resign.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.But despite changing consumer habits, owners of retail property are putting their faith in 5G wireless technology as a potential high street saviour, a separate report has found.Around 66 per cent of top British executives see cashier-less retail as one of the top two beneficial innovations to come with the introduction of 5G, according to Altus Group’s annual Commercial Real Estate Innovation Report.A further 77 per cent said they expect the benefits of new innovations in automated stock ordering to also help the struggling sector.The report surveyed 400 major property owners and investors with more than £200m of assets under management.Executives hope 5G will allow retailers to use both augmented reality and virtual reality to enhance the customer experience, while improving stock efficiencies and eliminating queues at checkouts.US warns Britain’s sovereignty in jeopardy over Huawei dealThe report acknowledges one of the short-term impacts of new technology could lead to further job losses, but executives said they believe it could also mean job creation in the longer term.Scott Morey, executive director at Altus Group, said: “5G presents a great opportunity for retailers to further improve the underlying performance of their physical stores by transforming the customer experience and shifting the role of their store personnel towards higher value tasks.“Shoppers fundamentally rely on stores during various stages of their shopping journey and 5G has the potential to further improve that interaction.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

Workers remain a cornerstone of Labour’s coalition.”Starmer to call for more devolution in ‘federal UK’ on campaign returnLabour backing indyref2 would be catastrophic for Scottish politicsLong-Bailey is not ‘continuity Corbyn’ candidate, Unite boss insistsLong-Bailey endorsed by Unite union in major campaign boostThe researchers say a Labour victory at the ballot box will be “impossible” without winning over voters with socially conservative views, but also warned: “Avoid making shallow appeals to these voters. Do not adopt insincere slogans or messages like ‘one nation Labour’ or ‘British jobs for British workers’. This is self-defeating, reinforces Tory messaging and risks eroding the Labour coalition. Focus on the economic policy offers that have support.”\u0026nbspInstead, they argue, a focus on economics and democracy will be critical in Labour gathering 14m votes needed to win the next general election.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By making values and identity the central questions of the day it has broken the party’s traditional electoral coalition.\u0026nbspStarmer to call for more devolution in ‘federal UK’ on campaign return“But it has also created a remarkable new Tory alliance. The seats won in the last two elections are very different economically to their traditional strongholds. If the economy becomes the most important issue then Labour can break up this potentially fragile Tory coalition.”Christabel Cooper, who also authored the report, said: “It is impossible for Labour to win the next election without the support of socially conservative voters that switched to the Tories this time.\u0026nbsp“But it would be a betrayal of both Labour’s fundamental values and of its core voters, for the party to embrace illiberal policies on issues such as minority rights. So how to bring these voters back without compromising our values is the big question facing the next party leader.”\u0026nbspThe Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, also added: “This report is a really important start to understanding the party’s defeat and how we can rebuild.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

The project is already massively over budget, it may well break the £billion mark soon, and running a decade late.A row about what to do about it is brewing in the Tory party.“HS is building up to be quite a serious disagreement within the party,” says one leading backbencher.Birmingham Tories are keen to save the scheme, believing it to be key to the re-election prospects of their West Midlands Mayor Andy Street.One argument they are deploying is that going ahead with HS would make it easier for the Government to scrap the third runway at Heathrow.They point out that when David Cameron backed the scheme while the Tories were in opposition, it was, in part, as an alternative to Heathrow expansion.Given that Boris Johnson has said he would lie down in front of the bulldozers before he allowed a third runway to be built, it would be extremely embarrassing for himthe project proceeded.But for a Prime Minister, who boasts of his commitment to infrastructure, to scrap two of the biggest transport projects in the country would be politically dficult. This might well be what saves HS, in some form.This Government knows what it wants to do.But the real challenge is actually delivering on this agenda, of ensuring that, when Boris Johnson pulls the levers, something happens.I UNDERSTAND that Boris Johnson is keen to amalgamate the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office this year.His experience as Foreign Secretary has left him convinced that you need to align the two departments.The UK will, though, remain committed to spending . per cent of national income on foreign aid.In preparation for this beefed-up role for the Foreign Office, I’m told Rob Oxley – the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary – is heading there to work for Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary.Oxley was with Boris and Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign before working with them in Downing Street.He is a trusted member of their team and his presence in the Foreign Office will ensure smooth relations between Downing Street and the FCO.He is also across the international issues, having previously been a special adviser at both the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.KEIR STARMER is out in front in the Labour leadership race.He has four times as many nominations from constituency Labour parties as any other candidate. Right now, this race is his to lose.If Starmer does win, it will consolidate a change in British politics. He will find it easier to squeeze Liberal Democrat voters in the south than to win back those Leave voters Labour have lost in the Midlands and the North in recent years. Labour’s sht to being a party of urban graduates will continue under him.The problem for Labour is that this approach simply will not win them enough seats to govern.In a generation’s time, it may well work. But not now. Starmer’s supporters argue that he comes without Jeremy Corbyn’s baggage and that many of the voters Labour lost at the last election will come back to the party as soon as they are offered a credible leader. This, though, seems an optimistic reading of events.One supporter of another candidate claims that the sense Starmer “looks the part” and “you can imagine him as PM” is just because he is a man. “Never underestimate the sexism of the Labour party,” she complains.NIGEL FARAGE will vote for the withdrawal agreement when it comes before the European Parliament next week. Farage had previously been a trenchant critic of the deal.He has described it as “awful”, “ per cent the same as Mrs May’s deal” and “a Remainer’s Brexit”. But he’s been convinced by the Government’s statements about how it doesn’t intend to be a rule-taker after Brexit.For this reason – and because it would look absurd for him to vote against Brexit – he will now back the deal. Farage plans to leave UK politics on January . But he intends to keep a watching brief, saying he is prepared toto the frayBoris Johnson’s government pulls back from its current position.Farage’s experience with the Brexit Party, which went from launch to topping the poll in the European elections in a matter of weeks, has persuaded him that new political parties can have an instant impact when required.THE row over a potential peerage for John Bercow is not going to go away. He is claiming he is entitled to one.But the Government is keen to stop the former Speaker getting one given how he twisted parliamentary procedure to aid those MPs who were trying to block Boris Johnson on Brexit.Meanwhile, the former chief clerk of the House of Commons, Lord Lisvane, has made a formal complaint alleging that Bercow bullied staff.One MP who Bercow appointed to the  of chairs tells me the most likely outcome to the row is that the House of Lords Appointments Commission does not accept Jeremy Corbyn’s nomination of Bercow.But rather than rejecting it outright, it will say “not now” and insist that all proceedings relating to Bercow’s alleged bullying are dealt with before a decision is made on whether he can go to the Lords or not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that. Because being isolated and stuck and hungry is part of what we are as well.This week she stood still and insisted Prince Charles crossed the room to greet her. And after they had shaken hands and exchanged pleasantries, she turned to the photographers and called a halt to proceedings.I’m not sure she had a clue who Charlie Boy was. But then she doesn’t have much of a clue about anything.A FEW weeks ago, many people were upset when I suggested that God had set fire to Australia.I realise now that this was a stupid thing to say. Of course God did not set fire to it. The Green movement did.Yes, climate change causes longer, hotter spells that increase the likelihood of a fire starting. But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into. The Aboriginals understood this. The early white settlers did too. That’s why they had controlled fires to manage the land properly.Sadly, though, ecomentals don’t understand this.So, by trying to save the country’s wildle, they’ve ended up incinerating it.However, it turns out that Land Rover was able to work out that, on the night in question, the car had been at the scene.Obviously, it’s great that technology can be used in this way. But I have a Range Rover and I’m not sure I like thinking that some herbert in Solihull knows where I am  hours a day. CHANNEL  News achieved new heights of unbalanced reporting this week while covering a pro-gun march in America.Instead of asking protesters why they wanted a machine gun, and then allowing the viewer to make up their mind, the reporter pounced on a family and asked the children why they were there.Needless to say, the kids had no clue and turned in baffled silence to their parents.I’m willing to bet, however, thatyou asked kids on an eco march why they were there, you’d get exactly the same response.But would Channel  News do that  Don’t hold your breath.I told the woman my name was Jeremy Clarkson. I told her the name on my credit card was Jeremy Clarkson. And that my account was in the name of Jeremy Clarkson.And when I’d finished, she said, with some excitement: “Hey!! Are you Jeremy Kyle ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Foreign students will get two years to find a job after graduating.And a new points-based system will keep us open to the brightest and best.Unskilled migrants will be filtered out — but they will get more points for working in an industry short of labour.We DO want lower overall migration. The pressure on wages, the NHS, housing and so on is unsustainable.But it is already sharply down on . And even the prospect of ending free movement has dramatically relegated immigration in the list of the nation’s priorities.We MUST, though, be far tougher on illegals who reach our shores, and vastly increase the tiny percentage we deport.That will end the deadly trafficking racket. And none are genuine refugees — or they would stay put in the EU which, as tearful Europhiles will tell you, is a welcoming, safe, liberal paradise.Britain must continue to rescue real refugees from warzone camps.Economic migrants from the EU, like everywhere , can come in on merit.THE Government is right to condemn America over Harry Dunn.It is taking our special relationship for granted.It tries to bully us over taxes on its tech giants, issues threats over Huawei and outrageously hides a death crash driver. Britain is right to push back.The US insists Anne Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. But it could rescind that. It simply refuses.President Trump presumably thinks he must side with US citizens come what may. But most of them also believe Mrs Sacoolas should face justice.She won’tvoluntarily. She doesn’t want to — and says a potential jail term wouldn’t be “proportional”.That is for a judge to decide. Mrs Sacoolas’s apparent negligence killed a young man. Even accidents have consequences.If she or Trump have any sense of right and wrong, she will be flown back.THE historic Brexit Bill is signed off. In less than a week we will be out.It is an extraordinary achievement by Boris Johnson and his team, though trade talks will still be challenging.One thing bothers us. Why does the EU still let Michel Barnier run the show His error, in plotting with Remainers trying to stop us leaving, ultimately triggered the “hard Brexit” they feared.That same ill-judged pig-headedness now could jeopardise entire industries.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets. It was their establishment hypocrisy that killed our love.One law for them and another for us. That makes people switch off.It isn’t complicated. You can fly by private jet OR you can lecture the world about saving the planet.But you can’t do both. Isn’t that screamingly obvious The Royal Family are not the only establishment hypocrites. Labour’s Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, a champion of the working man — thinks we should all send our children to the local comprehensive school.Even though, Lady Nugee confessed to Andrew Neil, that’s not what she chose for her own children.Establishment hypocrite.Harry and Meghan abandoned this country claiming they long for “financial independence”. Yet the millionaire couple always seem quite content to have some poor sucker sponsoring their lavish lestyle.There is no way Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan’s security.It is not politically possible for any Canadian PM to foist that expense on to their taxpayers.Ex-Mountie Larry Busch, who in the past has protected the royals in Canada, predicts the job will take  full-time officers and cost in excess of £.million a year.Who is going to pay for that  The “financially independent” Harry and Meghan  No chance.I can see it now. Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC. But this week I watched football on Sky and BT, drama on Amazon Prime and Netflix.None of the sport and drama I craved was on the BBC.Feeling nostalgic for Top Of The Pops and Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads  is not worth £. a year.The BBC is nakedly biased. And the BBC is increasingly irrelevant. So why does it still get £billion a year from the licence fee WITH Cats bombing at the box office, many of the cast are desperately distancing themselves from the furry turkey, including James Corden, who says he has not even seen the film.The exception is Taylor Swt, who says she has “no complaints”, adding: “I had a really great time working on that weird-ass movie.”But Taylor understands there are greater problems in le than having a flop at the box office.In an essay to mark her th birthday, she writes about her mother’s brain tumour.“Both my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again,” Taylor writes.“It’s taught me there are real problems and then there’s everything .”There is nothing like the loss of a loved one’s health to put le’s little knocks into perspective.THE president of the Durham Miners’ Gala sneers that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than allow newly elected Tory MPs to attend.Alan Mardghum says: “ did their best to destroy the Durham miners and the miners of Great Britain.”Does Mardghum honestly believe the mediocre Marxist muppets of today’s Labour Party have any interest in his community The Labour Party of today openly despises the British working class.That’s why so many ex-miners voted Tory.The proud, hardworking, patriotic communities of the North East have realised the Tories are now the party of the working class.If Alan Mardghum can’t see that, then he is dead in a ditch already. From the neck up.GEARING up for her turn as Catwoman in the next Batman movie, Zoe Kravitz reclines for the cover of the new issue of Elle magazine.You know you are getting old when you are shocked to learn the new Catwoman is the daughter of rocker Lenny Kravitz.A le peerage for a man who has done so much to make our lives a misery.Andthat doesn’t kill off the ermine-clad, silver spoon-sucking upper chamber for ever, nothing will.BORIS Johnson has asked Royal Mail chiefs to release a set of stamps commemorating Brexit to go on sale in January .It will be tough to improve upon the idea in Thursday’s Sun of a two-finger salute in front of the EU flag.The uniquely British gesture dates to the Battle of Agincourt in , when the French promised to cut off the index and middle fingers of English and Welsh archers.As French knights died in the Agincourt mud, our bowmen stuck up two fingers. More than an insult, it is a defiant message.We are still here. As a first-class stamp, it would take some licking.AFTER boasting about masturbating seven times a day preparing for his fight with Deontay Wilder, boxer Tyson Fury promises to bring out his own “w**k lotion” after the bout.“It’s called Tyson’s W**k Lotion,” reveals the Gypsy King.“It’s gonna be a bestseller because every-thing I put my name on goes to No, baby.”Meanwhile, Anthony Joshua is in talks for his own clash with hard-hitting Wilder this year.“A fight with me is what everyone wants to see,” says AJ.“Wilder has a great right hand.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This has been an astonishing abuse of the court and judicial process.Mr Brown has deliberately used these proceedings to bring improper and abusive claims and to launder defamatory allegations in order to elicit vast sums of money. Mr Brown did not attend the hearing today after accusing several members of the court staff of discrimination, bullying and conspiracy.Nick Candy now looks forward to recovering all costs associated with defending this claim from Mr Brown and will commence bankruptcy proceedings against himrequired.It was revealed in October that the penthouse had become Britains most expensive home after being remortgaged using an £million loan by Mr Candy.Mr Candy had lived at the house with his we the singer and actress Holly Valance, but the pair have now moved a few streets away.It boasts heated marble floors and a walk-in wardrobe - as well as a -metre pool, a cinema and even a library.One Hyde Park, which overlooks Londons Knightsbridge and Hyde Park, was designed by Richard Rogers at Rogers, Stirk, Harbour and Partners.It opened in  with flats and is made up of  apartments commanding a record-breaking price of up to £, per square foot.The interior was designed by Candy  Candy — the firm set up by Nick and Christian from just a £, family loan in  and now solely run by Nick.The building is guarded around the clock by SAS-trained security and serviced by an in-house maid service.Residents can also enjoy dry cleaning and room service provided by the five-star Mandarin hotel next door — and personal temperature-controlled wine store.Saunas, steam rooms, a squash court and the cinema also make up the developments unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King.

The Government said it was committed to reviewing how online advertising is regulated.Publishers have become increasingly dependent on search and social media s for driving traffic to their websites.The Government has committed to create codes of conduct that will re-balance and redefine relationships between news providers and the online s.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the moves would help ensure journalists in the UK are fairly treated and rewarded for their content.The  Cairncross Review recommended digital news products get the same VAT exemption as printed papers and the government bring in tax reliefs to encourage payment for online news content.In response, the Government said it will extend business rate relief to cash-strapped local newspapers until .The Government is also considering the merits and risks associated with extending the VAT zero-rating - which already exists with printed newspapers - to online news publishers.However the Government rejected proposals that state funding should be used to support public-interest journalism, saying it would damage a free press.Baroness Morgan of Cotes, the culture secretary, said: It is of vital importance that the press remains free and independent of government, and there are therefore areas where intervention by government would be inappropriate.Ministers ruled out creating an Institute for Public Interest News, saying it was not for the government to have a role in setting up such a body.The newspaper industry said it was disappointed with the lack of clear financial commitment and hoped concrete measures to help quality journalism would be announced in the budget.The News Media Association, which represents local and national titles, said: Without swt and signicant market intervention now, the flow of independent, high quality local news and information, which is essential for the ing of our democracy, can no longer be guaranteed.The Cairncross Review was commissioned in March  by the then Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to look into the sustainability of high-quality journalism in the UK.This was in response to falling circulations and publisher revenues, ongoing closures of local newspapers and losses of journalist jobs.Former journalist Dame Frances Cairncross published her report, containing nine recommendations, in February .The review said a regular should oversee tech giants like Google and Facebook to ensure their news content is trustworthy.It said online giants should help users identy fake news and nudge people towards news of high quality.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.It can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing, which increases the risk of it being passed on.Chinese health authorities also said it can spread before symptoms show up and its incubation period can range from one to  days.So far, the new coronavirus doesnt seem to spread as easily among people as SARS or influenza.Most of the cases so far that spread between people were of family members and health workers who had contact with patients.That suggests the new virus isnt well adapted to infect people.The World Health Organisation called the outbreak an emergency for China, but stopped short of designating it a global emergency.Cases have been reported in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States, as well as Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam.So far, no deaths have been reported outside China.Death toll: Infections: ,Severe acute respiratory syndromefirst appeared during a pandemic in China in .Like the current outbreak, its caused by a coronavirus and displayed similar flu-like symptoms such as a fever, cough and breathing dficulties.It can also result in a highly contagious and potentially le-threatening form of pneumonia.SARS is an airborne virus which is spread in small droplets of saliva coughed or sneezed into the air by an infected person.It can also be spread indirectly via surfaces and even through pooan infected person doesnt wash their hands properly.Evidence from the SARS pandemic of  to  showed people living with or caring for someone with a known SARS infection were most at risk of developing the infection themselves.Its thought that a strain of the coronavirus usually only found in small mammals mutated, enabling it to infect humans.The SARS infection quickly spread from China to other Asian countries and there were also a small number of cases in several other countries, including  in the UK.It was eventually brought under control in July , when people suspected of having the condition were isolated and passengers travelling by air were screened.In  there was another smaller SARS outbreak linked to a medical laboratory in China.It was thought to have been the result of someone coming into direct contact with a sample of the SARS virus, rather than being caused by animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission.Theres currently no cure for SARS, but research to find a vaccine is ongoing.Death toll: Infections: ,The  Spanish flu pandemic was the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history killing the most people in the shortest timeframe.It was first observed in Europe, the US and parts of Asia before it quickly spread throughout the world.The spread was aided by modern ships and a world war that required moving huge armies quickly across the globe.The virus caused typical flu symptoms, including fever, nausea, aches and diarrohea but many developed severe pneumonia, which ultimately became fatal.Dark spots would appear on the cheeks and patients would turn blue, suffocating from a lack of oxygen as lungs filled with a frothy, bloody substance, NPR reports.Research reconstructing the virus suggested it began in birds, then rapidly mutated, leaping to humans.Unlike the typical flu, where the highest mortality is in infants and the elderly, the  flu also struck down young, healthy adults.The military, with its overcrowded camps and troops ships, took a particularly bad hit.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery.Also a sudden movement of avian flu genes at the time– causing a change in the kind of hemagglutinin in an already existent flu strain – likely led to the pandemic.Hemagglutinin is a kind of protein which binds the virus to cells.There was also no vaccine for the strain in .Experts say that most people living today would have some immunity to viruses in the  virus family, called HN, while modern antiviral drugs may also be effective.Death toll: - million Infections:  million Ebola virus disease is a serious viral infection that originated in sub-Saharan Africa.It was first detected in  in an outbreak near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.The virus is thought to have originated in fruit bats, which are considered a delicacy in the area where the outbreak started.A person infected with Ebola will typically develop a high temperature, a headache, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat and severe muscle weakness.Symptoms start suddenly - between two and  days after becoming infected.Diarrhoea, being sick, a rash, stomach pain and reduced kidney and livercan follow.The infection may then cause internal bleeding as well as bleeding from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.Unlike the new coronavirus, Ebola is not an airborne disease, and as such it is impossible for a person to become infected by inhaling the same air as a patient.People can become infected through direct contact with bodily fluids of someone with the virus.Those at highest risk are typically healthcare workers, family members of those infected and other people who come into close contact with an infected person.Sexual transmission can occur, from men to women or men, after a persons symptoms have disappeared and they are declared free from the disease.No one has caught Ebola from someone  in the UK.There is no proven cure for the virus but in December , it was reported that a new and effective vaccine had been developed.The – outbreak in West Africa was the largest Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in  and ended with more than , cases and , deaths.It started in Guinea and then moved across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.The current -

But the Remain supporting author isnapost calling for people to ditch the coin because of politics. Instead it is because of what he says is a very basic error. It is missing an Oxford comma. The coin, which enters circulation on January , reads: Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.  An Oxford comma is used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items, so would be placed after the word prosperity. His Dark Materials author Sir Philip wrote on Twitter that the omission meant the coin should be boycotted by all literate people. Stig Abell, the editor of the Times Literary Supplement, also condemned the coinaposs punctuation. He tweeted: Not perhaps the only objection, but the lack of a comma after aposprosperityapos is killing me. However user @TychoNestoris replied: Be gone with your American serial comma nonsense! Also known as a serial comma, the punctuation mark derives its common name from its use in by the Oxford University Press . On its use, the OUPaposs style guide states: In a list of three or more items, insert a comma before the aposandapos or aposorapos. But author and economics commentator Frances Coppola said the punctuation was not essential for the new p. Responding to Sir Philip, she tweeted: As all literate people know, the Oxford comma is entirely optional. But it offends both in its presence and its absence.  Whatever the choice, someone will think it wrong. There could not be a better commemoration of Brexit. Sir Philip noted the debate was not a matter of grammar but orthography, the conventions of language. About three million Brexit coins will enter circulation around the UK from Friday, with a further seven million to be added later in the year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to receive one of the first coins later this week, his official spokesman said. The spokesman told reporters Iaposm sure he would wish to keep one as a souvenir.

But they must pay up-front and claim the costs back later, which leaves some facing four-figure bills.  nThe Department for Work and Pensionssays the policy is to prevent fraud.  nBut Nichola’s formal legal claim, backed by Save the Children, alleges the rule is unlawful, discrimination and breaches the European Convention on Human Rights.  n  n n , sign Greggs bonus petition after Boris Johnson says just aposone personapos complained n Important box Universal Credit claimants need to tick for free NHS prescriptions   nThe -year-old, who lives with daughter Sofia, , in Portslade, was stung when she moved from Citizens’ Advice to a full-time job with a housing association in September.  nShe was forced to cut her hours and borrow £, from payday lenders and family to cope with childcare costs.  nShe told the Mirror: “I have struggled since July.”  nThe childcare cash pays for after-school clubs for Sofia.

He taught us how to cook and that’s how I became a chef.” Eleven-year-old vegan chef Omari McQueen, along with “maths whisperer” Francis Elive are two heroes to restore your faith in human nature. South London-born Omari was just eight when he started his own business, Dipalicious, selling vegan dips and snacks. It isn’t just his first steps towards an empire that are so uplting. It is also the magnicent way in which he represents himself. While so many exasperated parents are forced to switch off the wi-fi or confiscate Xboxes or PSs, Omari can be found in the kitchen, educating himself. “I’ve got dyslexia so I find it dficult to read food labels,” he said. “Sometimes I smell the ingredients before I know what they are. When I was learning to read, I used cookbooks to help me remember words.” At a time when so much about our kids these days is negative, Omari and his response to adversity are a breath of fresh air. “I was beaten up at school by a boy in Year ,” he said.

from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe firm that made the cladding wrapped around Grenfell Tower knew six years before the disaster that it was unsafe, an inquiry into the fire heard today. At the opening of phase two of the inquiry, bereaved relatives and survivors heard how the multibillion-dollar US company, Arconic, knew in  the cladding  eventually used on the west London tower were “not suitable for use on building facades”. The hearing also heard the  performed worse in fire tests than it declared on safety certicates. The day began with counsel to the inquiry Richard Millet QC accusing the ious companies involved of passing the buck when it came to accepting any responsibility for the tragedy, which killed  people in June . He told the inquiry those looking in from the outside would be led to believe those involved in the - refurbishment of the building “did what they were supposed to do”. In biting comments, Mr Millet described how he had asked in phase one there be no “buck passing” but that his request had fallen on deaf ears. He said the firms had taken the approach that “what happened was somebody ’s fault”. Mr Millet said those affected are “owed at the very least an honest and a complete account from witnesses who are in a position to explain why it happened.” Afterwards, Prashant Popat, counsel for architects Studio E, claimed the firm acted “as would be expected of a reasonably competent architect in its position”, adding it had no idea products on the tower were unsafe. Marcus Taverner QC, the lawyer for Rydon – the main contractor on the tower’s refurbishment – referenced internal emails that showed how Arconic knew the fire performance of its Reynobond polyethylene-filled  was below the minimum required for facades in Europe. The  went on to be used on Grenfell with the knowledge of the conglomerate and “its representative was pleased when its product was selected”, the inquiry heard. Claude Wehrle, an Arconic official, explained in internal emails in June and July  how the fire rating of the  had dropped to class E from class B and they were therefore “unsuitable for use on building facades” in Europe. But, he said, “we can still work with regulators who are not as restrictive”. In  the same official said the  were “dangerous on facades and everything should be done to transfer to fire resistant as a matter of urgency”, adding: “This decision is technical and not commercial.” The  were later fitted on Grenfell during its refurbishment and the first phase of the inquiry last year found they were the primary cause of the spread of the blaze.  The second phase of the inquiry will examine decisions taken in the months and years before the fire, its immediate aftermath and the role of the UK government. Mr Taverner QC said: “Arconic continued to use thecerticate to promote sales of Reynobond and did so specically in the case of Grenfell Tower.” The inquiry also heard that Celotex, the company which made the combustible insulation which lay behind the cladding , was concerned in  about how it would behave in a fire when used with cladding . A Celotex official emailed colleagues in November  saying: “Do we take the view that our product realistically shouldn’t be used behind most cladding because in the event of a fire it would burn ” Rydon argued that although it was the main contractor on the refurb project, it delegated to other experts and subcontractors. Therefore, it argued, civil liability and “moral culpability” must be considered in terms of how dferent firms involved met their contractual obligations.  Grenfell United said yesterday: “We are hopeful the next phase of the Inquiry will expose the people and organisations who put profit and greed above our safety and the safety of our loved ones. They did not care about our lives, acted dangerously and  people died. Those responsible continue to deflect blame and we have to suffer their persistent refusal to accept accountability for the preventable loss of le. They must now be held to account. “The truth will be exposed and at the end of this process it will be clear that criminal charges must be brought for the deaths of our loved ones. It has been over two and a half years but our need to see justice has not faded.” Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said: “We have little time for buck-passing from the businesses complicit in wrapping Grenfell with flammable cladding. They must all be held to account.

Those required to answer questions or give evidence have a duty to comply fully - and that includes the arrogant Duke of York.Prince Andrew is shamefully accused by US prosecutor Geoffrey S Berman of “zero co-operation” with the FBI.The US agency is seeking to speak to him about his friendship with millionaire Jeffrey Epstein and the young women the now dead paedophile exploited. Andrew doesn’t appear to be the man of honour he claimed to be in that car crash BBC talk with Emily Maitlis. The Queen’s third child promised to help law enforcement. What we’ve got instead appears to be stonewalling. We demand the Prince immediately arranges to be interviewed.The monarchy exists only with public consent and this kind of behaviour could prove more dangerous for The Firm than rows about Harry and Meghan.The Queen must step in again and remind Andrew to do his duty and speak to the FBI. Never forget The Nazi Holocaust was one of the most evil crimes in history. We must never forget it so that it never happens again.

Andrea Worldwide was stopped by a male employee just as she was about to board the United Airlines plane from Denver, Colorado to Newark, New York.Staff eventually told Andrea the issue was her top, which was low cut and through which part of her bralet was visible. But photos show Andrea was also wearing a long cardigan and a scarf over the top. She said: “I’m completely humiliated, embarrassed, confused. I feel like all eyes are on me.” The woman added she was dressed for comfort for the four-hour flight, the first leg of her journey to see her long-distance boyfriend in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Eventually the gate staff changed their minds and let Andrea, a United Airlines platinum member, onto the plane on January . They even offered her a travel voucher as recompense. But Andrea declined this offer.  Two hundred dollars doesn’t even compare to the humiliation that I faced. If another female has to face this, I’d rather get the word out and maybe they’ll choose a dferent airline, she continued.United Airlines is now in contact with Andrea to deal with her complaint, reportsCBS ."},{"url":null,"title":"600 fishermen left stranded ice","story":"w.mantis  Hundreds of Russian fishermen have become trapped on a floating ice sheet forcing authorities to mount a rescue operation to get them safely back onshore.  nThe incident happened on the southern coast of Russia’s Sakhalin region on Sunday - a remote, isolated island in the east of the country.  nReports say brisk wind and the ebb of the ice caused a huge  metre crack to form, leaving  of the amateur fishermen cut off from the shoreline.  nSome were able to leave the ice floe by foot after discovering a land bridge, while  others were brought ashore by rescuers, Russiaaposs Tass news agency reported.  n  n  n   nMajor search for missing woman who vanished at Heathrow leaving suitcase on baggage belt  nSome fishermen had initially refused to leave the location and some demanded to be evacuated from the ice sheet by boat.  nThe rescue operation involved  people, four boats and one amphibious hovercraft Hivus-..  nVideo of the incident shows how the men were taken off the ice sheet in small groups until they were all accounted for.  nAccording to reports, the fishermen had ignored SMS warnings which had been sent to residents in the region urging them not to go on the ice that day.    n  nAt : p.m. [: GMT], all amateur fishermen who needed evacuation were brought to the shore by rescuers.

Simon Charles Dorante-Day from Queensland, Australia, says he was born when the heir to the throne and his now we were teenagers, but was put up for adoption. He has made the bizarre claims several times before but now says he has started legal proceedings in the High Court, Australia, to show the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are his parents. The -year-old is determined to prove he is second in line to the throne and says this is the most signicant step he has taken so far. Clarence House toldthey did not have any comment to make on the story. My grandmother, who worked for the Queen, told me outright that I was Camilla and Charles’ son many times, Mr Dorante-Day told New Idea. This is most explosive thing that’s ever happened to the palace. It’s definitely the most signicant step I’ve taken so far – I’ve had to force a deadline, hold them to a date, because we need answers.  He says he filed papers just before Christmas but court staff initially laughed at him. But now Mr Dorante-Day says a High Court judge in Sydney is assessing the case. He says he wants answers.

However, the -year-old is dferent – he hides a superhuman talent in plain sight.The Dundonian, a sixth-year pupil at Harris Academy, loves all things Dundee United – especially star man Lawrence Shankland – and relaxing with his friends.He’s also a talented swimmer. A rising star in the pool for Dundee City Aquatics , in fact. vw, px\"  Jack is the same but he is also dferent. On the autistic spectrum, he competes as a para-swimmer for the club, Scotland and Great Britain.You look at him and you wouldn’t necessarily think this unassuming, affable young man could be a Paralympic champion in the making.Yet that is his goal. And, once he gets to talking, you soon realise he has an iron will and a fire inside him that seems like it could crush any challenge that comes his way.“I feel likeI didn’t have autism I wouldn’t be me. I just find that really odd,” he told Tele Sport.“Being on the spectrum has its ups and downs but, overall, it makes me who I am.“I’m happy not to be treated dferently because some people see the disability before the ability and that’s quite sad.“It’s the same thing. A Paralympic medal is just as good as a medal at the Olympics, a world record is a world record. It’s the exact same thing, we’re just a wee bit dferent.“I’m focusing on my exams, that’s the main priority, but I’ve got the British Para-Swimming International Meet in April. vw, px\"  “This year it’s Paralympic trials. Hopefully, that’s making the team for Tokyo or seeing how close I am to the team. If I don’t make it this time, I’ll know for  where I need to be, what times I need to get and then work towards it.“When you hit , you go into the senior phase and it gets harder so I’ve room to improve before then.“It’s quite surreal because I was used to being a junior and now I’m competing with world record holders which is tough but it’s fun to test myself against them.”And, with the support of his family, club and the Scotland and GB set-ups, he’s had a bit to deal with.Being fielded with derisory questions over his eligibility to be a para athlete because he is able-bodied, being turned away from training with other clubs, living with his autism diagnosis and battling physical illness are all obstacles he continues to hurdle time and time again. Proven by his list of honours. vw, px\"  They are not limited to being Scottish champion, multiple times, a Tayside Schools champion, a Scottish and British record holder for his style of choice – the inidual medley – and a member of every elite swimming programme going.From close to home at the Institute of Sport and Exercise at Caird Park to travelling for the GB Para Academy, Jack is rightly an inspiration for young disabled people on Tayside.Winner of the Jenny Wood Allen Memorial Trophy at last February’s Dundee Sports Awards, he is defending that crown at this year’s ceremony at Caird Hall next month.And his advice to those thinking about taking up swimming is sage.“Swimming is a sport that is accepting of everyone. It doesn’t matter your gender, race or disability – it’s just a case of giving it a go.“If it’s not for you then that’s fine but you don’t know until you try.“You could just be a skinny six-year-old like me, confused, not knowing what to do and then end up becoming a champion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/medw-pet-foodbank-6.jpg ","title":"foodbank collection for pets launches in arbroath","story":"A pet shop owner has launched a new foodbank # for animals.Ashley Condie decided to open a collection for our four-legged friends last week after a conversation with a customer gave her the idea.She then posted the suggestion online and received such positive feedback she began taking donations at her store Abbey Pet Shop, on Lordburn in Arbroath.Ashley said: #We are collecting, dog food, cat food, rabbit, hamster, bird food, anything.

We know it will be tough but we can get through.”At the weekend, United prolonged the impressive run of form that’s seen them avoid defeat in all competitions since the middle of October with a last-gasp header from Lawrence Shankland.That came after the Tangerines trailed a stubborn Morton outfit for more than  minutes as it seemed their unbeaten league home record was at risk.Pawlett, though, says he was always confident they would level things up.He added: “We’ve been in good form and we want to stay unbeaten for the rest of the season.“Shanks popped up again and saved us on Saturday but I always knewwe kept plugging away it would come.“We were delighted to get the point in the end and results went our way where, so it is a point gained in the big picture.“We’re  points clear, we’re in a strong position, but we just need to focus on keeping results coming and, hopefully, win the league.”It’s not the first time United have trailed going into the closing stages of matches this season.And Pawlett reckons that character shown by the players could serve them well tonight heading to a dficult venue.“Against Arbroath earlier in the season at Tannadice it was a similar situation to Saturday,” he added.“Unfortunately this time we didn’t get the three points but we kept our unbeaten run going.“At the end we showed our character and belief.“We want to get the job done. The club needs to be in the Premiership and we are determined to do that.”The Hibs clash last weekend was Pawlett’s first for United since getting injured very early on against Partick back in October.The winger’s time at Tannadice has been stop-start due to injury problems and yet again on Saturday he had to limp off.It’s nothing to worry about, though, insists Pawlett as his time out of the team caught up with him.He said: “Yeah, I was fine. I’d been out for  weeks so I’m just getting my fitness back and I got a bit of cramp on Saturday. I feel fine.“Slowly but surely I’m getting myself right.“The ankle feels fine and that’s the most important thing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK

I’ve spent a lot of time on loan.“I had a two-year contract at St Johnstone, but I am really settled here now with a three-and-a-half-year deal.“I play better when I’m settled, rather than being punted out on loan here and there. I’m happy to be here and it will be even better once I get my fitness up.”Kennedy is still short of that full match sharpness because prior to signing for Aberdeen he had not played since before the Premiership’s winter break.Crucially, he missed St Johnstone’s - Scottish Cup defeat of Morton and is not cup tied for the competition.Kennedy will be free to face Kilmarnock, the club where he began his career, in the fth round at Pittodrie on Saturday February .Despite not playing for Saints since the - draw with Ross County on December , Kennedy was pitched straight into the starting line-up by McInnes.The winger revealed his frustration at St Johnstone and admitted he didn’t knowhe “was coming or going” during the window.He wanted to play – and even went to discuss his omission with Saints boss Tommy Wright hours before Aberdeen pushed through the deal to secure him.Kennedy said: “I was delighted to make my debut. There was a lot of speculation and I didn’t knowI was coming or going at St Johnstone, so I’m just happy to be here.“I’d only trained once with the boys and the gafferthrew me in, so I was delighted to get  minutes under my belt.“I’d not played since the last game before the break so it was good to get my fitness up.“It was a bit frustrating. St Johnstone obviously wanted to keep me.“I didn’t play the last two games so I was delighted to get it out the way.“Tommytold me he’d like to have played me, but he wasn’t going to until it was all sorted out either way.“I actually chapped his door the day I went to Aberdeen because I didn’t know what was going on and I said I wasn’t happy not playing.“We had a bit of a laugh about it, to be honest.“He just said it wasn’t fair on the boys or on me, maybe it was affecting me a little bit.“He just said he didn’t knowmy head would be right.“I told him it was and it didn’t matteror when I’d be leaving, I wanted to play.“St Johnstone did a lot for me, as did Tommy. I wanted to play every minute.“Tommy was great for me, he was a really big part of me going there and I enjoyed working with him day in, day out.”Some of the near ,-strong travelling Aberdeen support at St Mirren vented their frustrations, with chants calling for manager McInnes’ head.In the aftermath of the draw, McInnes admitted he was “gutted” to hear those chants.Kennedy, though, was oblivious. He said: “I didn’t hear any of that stuff so I couldn’t comment. But Aberdeen are a big club and they expect to win every game. It didn’t happen on Sunday, but hopefully now we can kick on and pick up the three points most weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Will you take that on board and have you learned any lessons about the mass evacuation of a school in extreme weather, whereby yoursquore actually putting kids at risk of dferent kind of injury when they got decanted out But the council chief said she did not agree that children were at risk.ldquoI think we always learn lessons from these kinds of events. We took action really quickly and the Fire Service were very happy with how the children were evacuated. We put in place very quick arrangements with the help of the community in taking a large amount of children to Priorsford School and down here . We did give out blankets and we did have facilities. Lots of members of community and older children who had extra coats were handing them out.It was acknowledged that the evacuated students could have sought refuge in the Sports Complex.ldquoThe one bit of learning that we do have is there was some consideration as to whether children could go into the Sports Complex, they could have, but they didnrsquot, said Ms Logan.ldquoThat would have been a safe place for them to go because itrsquos a separate building that wasnrsquot at risk of any fire.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

ScotWind Leasing will present Scotland as an attractive destination for the signicant investment needed to deliver the scale of offshore wind projects we want to see.’Employment was on the agenda at Campbeltown Community Council’s meeting last week.Chairman Alan Baker said: ‘We discussed the unemployment in the area due to ious redundancies that were issued, namely at Campbeltown Creamery and CS Wind.‘It was felt that after the initial meeting at the MACC premises that nothing further has been forthcoming.‘There is also to be a meeting in March with Fergus Ewing MSP to discuss further action.’The Courier asked both Mr Ewing’s office and the press office at the Scottish Government but no one could confirm the meeting was taking place, or when, by the time we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"valuable support offered to argyll businesses","story":"As Scotland#s national business advice service, Business Gateway helps thousands of customers to meet their business goals every year.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica.

Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

Now hersquos in civvy street struggling with bullying allegations.:#Iain Macwhirter: In post-Brexit Britain, Nicola Sturgeon cant keep telling her troops that Indyref is round the corner. It isntThe Commons chamber echoed with the voices of celebrity Remainers, like Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Rory Stewart. They are all now in the wilderness. Gone, too, the flag-waving fanatics outside the Palace of Westminster. BBC political presenters no longer have to compete with the megaphone cries of ldquoStop Brexit!.Well, no-one is going to shed any more tears about all that. The Brexit debate turned into a toxic culture war which had very little to do with the real issues of trade and citizenship. Everyone was too busy calling each other Nazis and racists or unpatriotic appeasers.Now the Withdrawal Bill has finally passed, everyone has lost interest. Itrsquos about boring stuff like trade. Yet it marks a historic defeat for the Westminster parliamentary system. The endless procedural wrangles and court actions of the last three years were in retrospect a huge waste of time and intellectual effort.But itrsquos worse than that. Wersquove been left with a legislative horlicks far more damaging than should have been the case. The Withdrawal Act is essentially Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit Bill, but without the ious concessions offered to Labour, without the Northern Ireland backstop and, most important, without parliamentary oversight.The protections on workersrsquo rights and the environment have been removed from the legislation, as has the idea of a regulatory level playing field. Protections for refugee children have been scrapped, along with other Lords amendments.The option of an extension to the transition period, due to end in December, is now ruled out by the Act. The much-debated Political Declaration is shorn of any legislative signicance.MPs will have no say on the negotiating mandate in the coming trade talks. Parliament will have no role in scrutinising the future trade deal.And thatrsquos not all. The ldquoHenry VIII provisions allowing the Government to change laws by secondary legislation, bypassing Parliament altogether, have been beefed up. The courts will not have to abide by the letter of EU law during the transition period.Itrsquos a comprehensive power grab. The Scottish Parliament will not be getting its ball back any time soon. Those powers over agriculture and the environment will remain in Westminster, evenresponsibility for administering them will be ed to Holyrood.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media smEEaug poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests smEEaug.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Glasgow City Council to write to Prime Minister on Scottish IndependenceIf the entire UK had remained aligned with the single market, Scotland might have found a halfway house. But Brussels has now ruled out Scotland getting similar concessions to those granted to Northern Ireland. They wonrsquot even talk about it.None of this was inevitable. Under Mayrsquos deal, had it gone through in amended form, Parliament could still have been a major player in Brexit. For three long years, MPs had the power and authority to shape the Withdrawal Agreement ndash but they blew it. Now, Boris Johnson can do whatever he wants.Labour were largely silent this week, probably out of sheer embarrassment. They must know that they helped to make leaving the EU far harder than it need have been. They placed opposing Brexit higher than making the best of Brexit, so they ended up with the worst.It was common knowledge that most MPs favoured a Norway-style option of remaining in the single market while leaving the political institutions of Europe. Hard Brexiters might have complained that joining the EEA was a sellout, but Irsquom pretty sure voters would have accepted staying in the single market as the most sensible short-term solution.Voters werenrsquot bothered about free trade but about sovereignty and identity. Brexit wasnrsquot about erecting tarfs but curbing Brussels bureaucracy. It wasnrsquot really about immigration either. Boris Johnson is already relaxing immigration rules.And evenNorway proved unacceptable, there could have been a Swiss solution, which basically involves accepting the rules of the single market without actually joining it. This was really what Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal was moving towards.It sought ldquofrictionless trade by keeping the closest possible relationship with the EU.Her Irish backstop would have kept the entire UK in regulatory alignment with the single market.But the opposition parties werenrsquot having it. The SNP which had argued cogently for Norway plus for two years, suddenly turned into hardline Remainers.The Liberal Democrats went full revoke with disastrous consequences for their leader, Jo Swinson. Labour refused to accept the compromises offered by Theresa May last spring.Remainers thought they had Boris over a barrel that he couldnrsquot reopen the Withdrawal Deal. But he did. His backstop leaves Northern Ireland as a regulatory colony of the EU, but it was undeniably a new deal. Labour condemned it on the grounds that it abandoned Northern Ireland, even though theyrsquod previously claimed the PM was in the pocket of the DUP.Johnson has wasted no time demonstrating that he is not in the pocket of Donald Trump either by backing a digital tax on Google and by refusing to rule out Huaweirsquos involvement in G. Labour claims that the PM intended to ldquosell the NHS to Trump and allow chlorinated chickens to take over the supermarket shelves now look ridiculous.I know this is not how many of my Remain friends on Twitter see it. To them, Brexit was all about fighting fascism and ldquonativism. But the talk of creeping authoritarianism, ldquodark money, Russian interference was a kind of paranoid displacement activity ndash an excuse for not coming to a sensible compromise.The devolved parliaments last week voted to refuse consent to the Withdrawal Act. But any leverage the Scottish Government may have wielded has been lost by the General Election result. Holyrood will now be sidelined in future legislation on fish and farming.This week, on the eve of Brexit Day, Nicola Sturgeon says she will give her latest timetable for independence. But the SNP has no answer to the new constitutional reality: it will now be arguing for independence outside the European Union rather than from within it.Wersquore out of Europe, and wersquore going to stay out for a long time. There will be no referendum this year or next. Brussels is determined to impose a draconian trade deal. Investment in Britain has stalled.And wersquoll have the indignity of going through the ldquoother passports queue at airports.

I donrsquot underestimate how challenging this is going to be.ldquoBut equally I know what the risks and the realities will bewe donrsquot have this.ldquoIf yoursquore going to have a UK-wide system that is trying to cut migration, and that is a one size fits all, thatrsquos pretty disastrous for Scotland.ldquoSothey want to have that objective in the rest of the UK, but allow some iation within Scotland, then therersquos a discussion to be had there.ldquoIf there is a complete blanket refusal to discuss these things, this sort of view that the Westminster system is incapable of accommodating Scotlandrsquos distinctive interest, just becomes more and more of a real thing.However the Home Office immediately rejected the idea, saying the new immigration system being introduced in  would remain reserved to Westminster.A Home Office spokesperson said: ldquoImmigration will remain a reserved matter. The UK Government will introduce a points-based immigration system that works in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Scotland.ldquoWe want to understand the specic needs of the whole of the UK, which is why we have engaged extensively with stakeholders across the UK, including the Scottish Government.A UK Government source added: We are not planning to devolve immigration, not least because Scottish businesses do not want that to happen.ldquoThey fear the additional red tape it would bring.The issues facing Scotland are not unique to Scotland, so we want to develop a system that is flexible enough to work for all parts of the UK.There has been less migration to Scotland than to some other parts of the UK.ldquoThe Scottish Government have extensive economic powers and should be using those to make Scotland a more attractive place to settle, live and work.\"SNP migration ministerBen Macpherson said:ldquoThe proposals for a tailored migration policy for Scotland are supported by employers, universities and organisations across Scotland and are an essential part of sustaining and improving economic growth, prosperity and public services.ldquoA failure by the UK Government to support proposals to meet Scotlandrsquos unique needs would be a further sign that the system does not work for Scotland, and it is to be hoped the UK Government rethinks this out of touch response.SNP MSP Tom Arthur said: ldquoIndustry and employers recognise that getting the migration system right is vital for our social and economic wellbeing, and the support shown for the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposals are heartening.ldquoConsidering that support, the UK government need to do much better than a curt dismissal.ldquoSimply dismissing this serious plan out of hand proves our point that Westminster doesnrsquot work for Scotland.Labour MSP Claire Baker said: ldquoScotland faces particular demographic challenges, and we need a compassionate, fair immigration system that supports our economy, public services and all our people.ldquoTherefore, Scottish Labour supports exploring a degree of flexibility within an overarching UK immigration system. We look forward to seeing the detail of the governmentrsquos proposals.Alison Evison, president of the council umbrella group Cosla, added: ldquoCoslawould like this policy paper to start a meaningful debate on what our immigration system should look like post-Brexit.\"There is a strong unied voice across all sectors in Scotland in favour of a flexible immigration system that can meet our particular economic, workforce and population needs.\"For many years, Coslahas been calling for an immigration system that can be responsive to local as well as national needs and that recognises and addresses the challenges that we face.\"We have to identy more policy levers to encourage people to move to Scotland and Local Government has a key role to play in developing an immigration system that works for every part of Scotland.\"We look forward to engaging in a fruitful conversation to enable this to happen.Andrew McRae of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, said: ldquoThe new paper from the Scottish Government is a timely and evidence-based intervention.ldquoIt sets out a pathway towards a UK system that can flex for Scotlandrsquos distinct demographic and economic needs, without creating additional burdens for smaller businesses.ldquoThe UK Government should acknowledge that it is possible and desirable to enable its immigration system to respond to dferent regions and nations, as well as maintain strict border controls and a user-friendly system."},{"url":null,"title":"succession-star-brian-cox-reveals-turn-knighthood-calling-cbe-mistake","story":"The Dundee-born actor, a strong backer of Scottish independence, admitted he should have ldquothought better of collecting the honour for services to drama in .:Successions Brian Cox recommends getting stoned on cannabis to deal with politicsGolden Globe winner Cox, who stars in the HBO series as Logan Roy, added he would reject the offer of becoming a knight, despite calling the CBE a ldquoprecursor to the most senior honour.The -year-old caused controversy earlier this month when he was dropped as a patron of an elderly care home after admitting to regularly smoking cannabis as a way of ldquodealing with the political situation on both sides of the Atlantic.He said: ldquoI have a royalist sister and a republican sister and I thought, well my royalist sister will be happy but she couldnrsquot give a s**t.

Both of us quickly fell in love with Scotland. Wersquove long considered ourselves adopted Scots. Our two daughters are Scottish to their core. That makes us very proud. Therersquos much to admire about this country and its people.When we arrived, new Scottish friends thought it funny that wersquod come to Glasgow to escape sectarianism. But to us, Rangers and Celtic and a few Orange and Republican flute bands and marches were almost laughable in themselves.If thatrsquos what the Scots called sectarianism, we thought, then wersquod nothing to fear. Though we always wondered to ourselves: why the hell did the otherwise intelligent Scots accept this ugly hangover from Ireland in their society But to us all that mattered was that the orange and green yobs werenrsquot gunmen. Football hooliganism wasnrsquot political murder. Back then, Scottish sectarianism was so mild, in my eyes, compared to what had gone on back in Northern Ireland, that it was almost invisible to me. And it remained that way for a long time.Now, though, something is stirring in the darkest recesses of Scotlandrsquos soul and itrsquos ugly. At the weekend, we had yet another display of sectarian hatred imported from my country and played out on the streets of Glasgow. There were arrests and a police officer was injured after a Republican march and a Loyalist counter-demonstration clashed.The parade was organised by the West of Scotland Band Alliance - ostensibly over Bloody Sunday. The far right National Defence League organised the counter protest. Hundreds of police were deployed. Missiles were thrown.Back in August there was a riot in Govan when a similar scenario played out - a Republican flute band was met by Loyalist demonstrators. In September, a police officer was injured following two Republican marches and subsequent clashes with Loyalist protestors.When it comes to the weekend marches, some will apportion more blame to Loyalists than Republicans because Bloody Sunday is seen as a good cause. Irsquod say this: calling for the truth about Bloody Sunday, and the prosecution of British soldiers involved in the murder of civilians, is the right thing to do. I support that fully. However, nobody needs lessons from Republican flute bands anymore than they do from extremist Loyalists. The messenger matters, not just the message.And as so many people from Northern Ireland who now live in Scotland think: why are these marchers, on both sides, bringing the hatred of Ulster here  Marchyou like, but do so in Belfast or Derry.I should lay my cards on the table. I come from a religiously mixed family, with a Catholic mother and Protestant father. Irsquom an atheist. When it comes to Northern Ireland I support neither side. However, politically, I do support the reunication of Ireland solely by democratic means. I detest the IRA as much as I detest the loyalist murder gangs that ruined my country.Irsquove also reported on the Troubles and the legacy of the Troubles my entire working le. Much of that work was about exposing crimes the British government committed. I hold a torch for no side. Irsquove had guns pointed at my head as a reporter, and death threats. Irsquove been attacked, kidnapped.I know the type of people attracted to the kind of sectarian demonstration which is becoming more frequent and more daring in Scotland. They arenrsquot good people. Theyrsquore dangerous. The ideas in their heads shouldnrsquot be let loose in society.Republican and loyalist extremists are in love with the romance of violence.I said earlier that I love this country, and I do - thatrsquos why I really fear the growing confidence and visibility of these people. Theyrsquoll take any opportunity to turn Scottish society into something dreadful.Last week, two protestors heckled Nicola Sturgeon in Parliament, shouting: ldquoHow many support the IRA in your party  The men were reportedly connected to the Progressive Unionist Party - which is linked to the UVF.MSPs like the SNPrsquos John Mason and Conservative Murdo Fraser have added fuel to a fire that needs no kindling. Previously, Mason apologised for saying some see the IRA as lsquofreedom fightersrsquo, and Fraser referred to Rangers as lsquothe Queenrsquos rsquo. Only fools flirt with the Devil.Recent years have taught us that anything can happen in politics. Extremists can emerge from the shadows before the public knows whatrsquos happening.In England, Brexit allowed extremist identities to flourish. Political opponents were disparaged as lsquotraitorsrsquo or lsquoNazisrsquo. We need to guard very strongly against extremists trying to hijack the debate over Scottish independence.Apart from some ugly scenes by loyalists in Glasgow in the immediate aftermath of the  referendum, the constitutional schisms in Scotland have been remarkably decent.However, those Republican and Loyalist extremists have been animated by the tensions between independence and the union. Theyrsquoll try to make this fertile ground for themselves. Scotland needs to stop them doing so at all cost.Many friends of mine from Northern Ireland who live in Scotland would ban these marches outright. I support freedom of speech and assembly, however - although, notit imperils public safety.If these demonstrations are a risk to safety then ban them. Nor do these marchers have any right to parade through the city. They can find another place to march. If they wish to march in a particular community then it should be incumbent on Glasgow City Council to ask every member of that communitytheyrsquore happy with such a demonstration. If a majority of locals are happy, then let the demonstrators parade in a local park.At every turn, box these extremists in, undermine them, challenge them, exhaust them - because these people want to take the society that Irsquove come to love very dearly in Scotland and destroy it, just the way they destroyed Northern Ireland many years ago.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"deeply-moving-testimony-importance-making-every-precious-moment-together","story":"Away from the vapid, make-believe world of social media of \"Friends\" and \"Likes\", out here in the real world, there is space for one, and certainly no more than two of the deep and meaningful relationships Mr Jamieson and his we Jean had clearly enjoyed.That he has continued to contribute creatively to the pages of the newspapers since the death of the love-of-his-le only last October is quite remarkable, his emotive and emotional essay must have been as dficult to compose as it was tough to consume, but perhaps it was cathartic for him As someone with a similarly seminal relationship dating back to , with a half-century hopefully ndash but not certainly ndash on the horizon, the fear of the loss of such a singular soul-mate is as terrying as it is a grim reminder that none of us is immortal.Mr Jamiesonrsquos words, distressing, depressing yet heart-warming and reassuring in equal measure should serve as a reminder to us all that, whilst nothing is forever, for as long as a relationship like theirs ndash and mine ndash exists and thrives, it is vitally important to make the very most of it, making certain to express onersquos true emotions, to make every moment together count, taking nothing, or no-one for granted.A very poignant and penetrating article, fine journalism, conveying important le lessons for us all as we and those we love reach the tipping point on the baggage carousel of le, and,there is any consolation to be had in such sad circumstances, there will be millions who, for whatever reason, have never experienced such true and unalloyed love, respect and affection.Mike Wilson, Longniddry."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-licence-fee-outdated-says-john-sergeant","story":"The ex-journalist, , said other means of paying for BBC programmes ndash such as subscription, programme sponsorship or even advertising ndash should be considered.He made the comments as BBC boss Tony Hall prepares to step down as director-general in the summer after seven years in the job.:Lord Tony Hall to step down as director-general of the BBC"},{"url":null,"title":"rare-swordfish-sighting-waters-off-east-coast-scotland","story":"The creature was identied swimming through SSE Renewablesrsquo Seagreen offshore wind farm site by HiDef Aerial Surveying Ltd during digital aerial wildle surveys of the area.Ecologists studying the sitersquos video footage from August  noticed the shape of the fish, which was two metres long and was recorded close to the sea surface.@HiDefSurvey discover Scotlands nd ever Swordfish in the North Sea for @SeagreenWind for @SSE showing the power of digital video aerial surveys.

Waste management has a cost associated with it, as well as the cost of carbon emissions. Effective, high-quality recycling reduces both of these things.When it comes to choosing a waste management provider, organisations need to look beyond the face value of what is being offered. Some service providers will offer seemingly low-cost solutions but then charge for recyclable materials as waste ndash this is an unnecessary cost to the client, as the true cost of recycling that material would be much cheaper.Suppliers collecting low-quality, mixed and contaminated materials - AKA lsquoDry Mixed Recycling rsquo - are contributing to the mounting waste problem and continually fail to capture enough high-quality recyclables. Collecting this DMR is a waste of company time and money.The only way to increase recyclables at the user end is to collect dry, clean, High-Quality Recyclablesand store them separately, before being collected by a reliable recycling firm thatrsquos committed to optimising your waste management and recycling systems.While there is still much to be done to fix the current system, the good news is that the collective mindset is starting to sht. More staff are bringing the good habits they have adopted in their homes into the workplace which is driving interest in eco-friendly working practices.As depressing as it is to have had the ban on sending biodegradable waste to landfill pushed back from  to , the introduction of the Circular Economy Bill brings new opportunities to influence attitudes and behaviours. The real onus on improving business waste management lies in the hands of the supplier.

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us.

I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option.

They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet.

According to Government briefings written up in the Scottish press, this will involve a “major push” for a second independence referendum. Appearing on TV at the weekend, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that his party would seek to “mobilise public opinion” behind a fresh vote.Of course, this will come as no surprise to anyone in Scotland: mobilising for independence is the SNP’s raison d’etre. But far from developing our national horizon, I believe the SNP’s approach this week shows just how limited its ambition really is.I have made no secret of the fact that I fear for Scotland’s future, and that of the whole UK, under Boris Johnson’s Conservative Government. I fear as well for the future of the planet unless we seize the initiative and act radically and justly now.: Ian Blackford: Independence is a ‘beacon of hope’ for people in Scotland: Scotland needs home rule - Gordon BrownBut when I was invited to set out my vision for Scotland’s future to the Citizens Assembly of Scotland the weekend before last, I knew that fear alone is not enough – nor should it be. Because the people of this country look to politicians for hope – for an alternative – andwe cannot set out a roadmap for change, we may as well step aside.So I spoke of my vision for a Scotland that is more equal, more tolerant, and free from fear: fear of poverty fear of homelessness fear of hunger and the fear of physical squalor amidst the huge inequalities of wealth.Tories and SNP inflaming tensionsAt the Golden Jubilee Hotel in Clydebank, where the assembly is sitting over a series of weekend sessions, Professor Chris McCorkindale and Dr Alan Renwick set out the constitutional framework which we inhabit. And then John Sturrock QC introduced the  of political speakers by setting out the constitutional debates which currently occupy us so much. Each of us made a five-minute pitch to the assembly members, who have been chosen from the ranks of the public to represent Scotland in all its ersity. But when the microphones moved to the floor, there was a marked change of mood – with citizen after citizen calling on the politicians to address the social, economic and environmental challenges facing our society.The focus of these contributions reinforced something I have felt for some time: that the public discourse on Scotland’s future is upside down. I oppose Scottish independence because I firmly believe a Home Rule settlement within the UK would offer us the best opportunities for transformative change. And I am energised by this prospect now more than ever because I believe that the visions for Scotland proffered by both the Tories and the SNP will only inflame the isions in our society – not resolve them.But far too much of the debate, whether at Holyrood, on election campaign trails, or on the pages of our newspapers, treats constitutional settlements not as means to ends, but as ends in themselves. A desire for changeI accept that Labour’s message on both Brexit and Scottish independence did not cut through last autumn, and we are actively discussing this as part of a review into our defeat. Butwe are to be honest with the people of Scotland, we must resist the temptation to applaud either Boris Johnson’s “get Brexit done” message or Nicola Sturgeon’s call for a second independence referendum, simply because both were electorally successful.For it is apparent that on December , Scotland voted for change. Scottish Labour needs to reflect on why the people of Scotland no longer see Labour as the vehicle for their ambitions to transform society, but it would be a mistake to see these ambitions as simply constitutional. I met voters who told me they were opting for the SNP to challenge the Tory Government, to defy the political establishment or to stop Brexit.And so it is no good for the SNP to be summarily dismissed as a party of the right masquerading as a party on the left – accurate as that may be. We cannot get away from the fact that many voters – including large numbers of former Labour voters – have turned to the SNP to articulate their desire for change. And I believe that Home Rule within the UK could allow us to make many of the changes that SNP voters want to see, particularly in making Scotland a fairer society in which the Government intervenes to support our public services and grow and reform our economic base, not least in using the considerable powers which already rest with the Scottish Parliament.Bringing Scotland togetherAnd much as the SNP presents independence as a panacea, it is clear from their own so-called Sustainable Growth Commission that it would exacerbate – not reverse – many of the injustices of the past decade. The party’s economic blueprint, by their own admission, would yield ten more years of cuts. Supporters of independence tell us that need not be the case, that after separation we could chart a dferent course. But surely it’s the other way round: the SNP should be setting out the kind of society and economy it wants to create, and its constitutional offer should follow. If that’s the society and economy that the Growth Commission sets out, then perhaps independence is the way to create it: but that’s a startling lack of aspiration from a so-called party of Scotland.I’ve been told that at a time of constitutional polarisation, our vision for Scotland is not workable, but I firmly believe it is the only way to bring our country together, rather than further entrench the isions of the past ten years. Andearlier generations had not possessed vision, and campaigned with conviction, there would be no NHS, no welfare state, no equal rights, no Open University, no full employment, no publicly owned housing.

If a situation occurs outside anticipated parameters then electronic control can be useless. Aircraft have landed in the wrong place and landed unexpectedly at Sumburgh. In such circumstance everyone is safer when the situation is within view of a live controller in the airport tower. Such a lookout may also assist aircraft in dficulties, and react tovandalism and other hazardous outbreaks.They should do away with all that glass windows in the control tower as well as all the windows in control towers all over the world as they are clearly not needed. All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

Its about people much more than trade or the economy,\" he said.

We cannot rewrite history.\"Read MoreVaradkar: always a seat at EU table for UKBrexit a failure Earlier, the EUs chief negotiator met Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill and DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds - representing Arlene Foster - at Stormont.Mr Barnier told his audience at Queens that he understood the economic fears about the future checks and controls for goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain.\"But Brexit unfortunately has consequences that we must manage.

This makes frictionless trade impossible. It makes checks indispensable.\"He said the checks had to take place somewhere.\"As the whole point of the protocol is to avoid a hard border and protect the all-island economy, it was clear that they could not take place at the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"The only real option was to use Northern Irelands other entry points. This is also where such checks are the easiest to implement. And controls will also take place in Dublin and other EU entry points.\"Mr Barnier said negotiating the future UK-EU partnership would be a huge challenge. \"A new clock is ticking,\" he said. \"Eleven months is extremely short. Prime Minister Johnson has said he will not extend this period. This means that the UK will leave the Single Market at the end of this year.\"The EUs ambition is to create a close economic partnership. One that is based on a level playing field. That is the only way we will be able to achieve a truly ambitious deal. A deal that benefits both sides. A deal that - evenit will never match what we have now - lives up to our ambition to remain the best of friends and allies.\" Mr Barnier told his audience how on a personal level \"for many reasons\", he regretted Brexit. \"I will always continue to believe that we are better off together than alone - especially in todays world. That is why I will remain a patriot and European,\" he said.\"But I will also always have profound respect for the UK, its people, culture, great leaders - such as Winston Churchill - and its solidarity with the rest of Europe during its darkest hours.\"That is why at the beginning of this new chapter of European history, I would really like to wish the UK well - speaking here in Northern Ireland - as it embarks on this journey.\"Mr Barnier said he was pleased to meet Northern Irelands political leaders jointly on Brexit as his previous discussions with them had been conducted separately. He welcomed the restoration of devolution.The DUP and Sinn Fein did not appear together afterwards because of their dferences on Brexit, but Mrs ONeill said Mr Barnier was right to point out the risk of a \"clf edge\" come December ,a deal was not agreed.\"We are all very clear that we could come towards the end of the year and there could be a clf edge and we could end up coming out with no trade deal for the future,\" she said.\"Thats going to be catastrophic for trade patterns for the future - for many, many decades. Thats why we have the [Ireland NI protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement].\"Mrs ONeill said there was less than a year to negotiate the sort of trade deal that was usually conducted over a far longer time frame. \"I would be very concernedit is doable in the  months,\" she said.Mrs ONeill and Mrs Foster will meet with members of the UK Government and the devolved administrations in Cardf today to discuss the UKs relationship with the EU after Brexit. Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will also attend.Mr Gove said that \" will be a year of growth and opportunity as we level up across all four corners of the country and strengthen our Union\". He added: \"This has started positively with the restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland, and I look forward to seeing First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill back around the table today for the first time since .\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul Duffy, chief executive of the Driver and Vehicle Agency , said in a statement last night that following further inspections of lt faults at MoT centres, the contractor had not provided sufficient assurances on the effectiveness of the ongoing repairs.Tests on heavy good vehicles and buses will continue.Anyone scheduled for a car or light vehicle MoT today has been told not to attend.Mr Duffy said the “precautionary measure” had been taken to ensure the health and safety of staff and customers.Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon held an urgent meeting with officials this evening in relation to the matter.The DVA has said that all customers, except customers with four-year-old vehicles and taxis, will be automatically issued an MoT exemption certicate and therefore can continue to drive.The exemption will be recorded in the DVA system and a hard copy will arrive by post in the coming days.Mr Duffy said: “For customers with four-year-old vehicles and taxis, we are working to urgently find a solution to get these vehicles through MOT and will contact customers directly.“The DVA will issue a further statement as a matter of urgency to advise these customers and those who have MoTs booked for later this week. We want to advise customers that more cancellations are very likely.“The DVA recognises the considerable inconvenience and disruption this will cause for many people and sincerely apologises that it has been unable to recty this situation more quickly.“Given the urgency of this situation, we are asking the public to follow media, social media channels and nidirect for updates. Staff will also be kept fully informed by their centre managers.”Earlier, Ms Mallon had refused to saycompensation will be provided to those affected by cancelled MoT tests to pay for hire cars.She was also unable to give a timeframe as to when the situation will be resolved, but said she was taking steps to ensure it would not happen again.Around , tests have already been cancelled after signs of cracking were uncovered in  of  vehicle lts at MoT centres across Northern Ireland.Inspections and repairs are currently being carried out, with Ms Mallon issuing temporary four-month exemptions to affected drivers. Those who had an appointment cancelled will also be refunded half of the test fee and given a free test.Askedcompensation will be paid out to drivers who have to hire a car due to their MoT certicate expiring as a result of a cancelled test, the minister said she was restricted in what she could do. “I have to operate within the legislation and I absolutely understand the disruption that’s been caused to people. You mentioned people that are working class and are struggling to make ends meet — that’s why I got into politics,” she told BBC Radio Ulster’s Nolan Show.“In term of compensation, I have to operate within the legislation, this is public money. “I have considered compensation, but what are the parameters  What are the thresholds  What are the criteria  We get into a very dficult area.” Ms Mallon said she first became aware of the problem last Tuesday when she was told of one faulty vehicle lt. On Wednesday she was told  lts had been taken out of operation. She moved to issue exemptions within  hours.The exemption, however, does not apply to four-year-old cars, as they have never been issued with an MoT certicate, although they will be prioritised, alongside taxis.“I’m restricted in what I can do for taxi drivers, as they are subject to a PSV licence,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland mot suspension came out of the blue official admits","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It would cost probably between £, to £, per lt, but we will need to go through some commercial discussions around that.\"Mr Duffy said he could not give an exact time frame as to how long it would take to identy and replace affected lts, but \"preliminary enquiries\" were taking place.\"Those are the issues were grappling with today. Theres is likely to be a lead-in time where lts would have to be manufactured and then installed.\"We have started some enquiries, but we havent got into the detail of how long [it would take to replace]  lts.\"Mr Duffy said it was likely to be a matter of weeks, but he \"could not rule out\" the process taking months.\"The most important thing is that we ensure our staff and customers are coming into a safe environment, soit takes weeks or months to sort this issue out, its important that we protect the safety of our staff.If all  vehicle lts had to be replaced at a cost of £, each, this would amount to £.m.All customers who have had tests cancelled will be issued a four-month exemption so they can continue to drive, however this does not apply to taxis and four-year-old vehicles.Mr Duffy said that, while lanes at MoT centres where cars and light vehicle lts are situated are not in operation, lanes for heavy goods vehicles are ing. He said these lanes would be used to test taxis and four-year-old vehicles as a matter of priority.Questions have also be raised regarding car insurance andthose with an MoT exemption who are involved in an accident will be adversely affected.Read MoreMoT chaos: Minister Nichola Mallon refuses to be drawn on compensation for hire cars Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers advised affected drivers to noty there insurerthey have received an exemption certicate.\"Insurers will be pragmatic in these situations.

The incident occurred at a time when temperatures dropped to a freezing -C across the city. Despite reports that the woman was homeless, a well-informed source told the Irish Independent that she was not a client of Dublin Region Homeless Executivesservices. However, she is described as \"extremely vulnerable\". And while gardai said there was no criminal aspect to the incident, they are gathering information to establish why this woman gave birth on a cold street corner. Thankfully, the mother, who is from Finglas, and her baby are understood to be well and were last night being cared for in a Dublin hospital. In her distressed state, the woman is believed to have carried her baby km away from where she gave birth to Inns Quay before being picked up by an ambulance at the Four Courts. The ambulance had been called by concerned passers-by. One local witness said he heard a woman screaming on the street at around am. \"At first I thought it was horseplay, but she kept screaming so I looked out,\" said the man. \"I saw a lady who was very distressed and people running to her. There were four people who crossed the road to her, and a man in a car stopped, too. \"They were giving her scarves and clothes. There was a lot of material changing hands and people were pointing down on the street,\" he explained. \"I didnt fully understand what was going on, and then the woman walked away and the people who had helped her were putting their hands to their heads asthey were in panic. \"I could see someone on a phone,\" he added. One of the concerned people who had come to the womans aid followed her while directing emergency services, and she was treated by an ambulance crew at Inns Quay before being taken to hospital. Gardai sealed off the scene, as well as where the woman was met by the ambulance.It is understood that due to the sensitive nature of the stress she has experienced, it may take some time before she can be interviewed and identied. \"There are more questions than answers at this stage, and we have to be aware of the sensitive nature of the case,\" said one source. Local councillor Christy Burke said it was extremely important that an investigation is carried out into this incident to determine how the woman came to give birth on the street. \"Its an absolute travesty that she had to give birth on the side of a road,\" he said. \"Its just unthinkable that we have come to this. \"Regardless of the circumstances, Im sure this very distressing incident will prove that the Government need to take drastic action into caring for those that need the most help. \"Thank God members of the public came to this womans aid and that shes now being taken care of,\" he said.Gardai sealed off the scene on the corner of Linenhall Street yesterday morning as well as where the woman was met by the ambulance.While they are not being treated as crime scenes, gardai were gathering information this morning at both scenes as per protocol to help establish the facts of the matter.Dublin Fire Brigade confirmed they received a call at .am of a woman in labour at Inns Quay."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/a469a/38891653.ece/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Scotland-protestors-2.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon heckled over snps ira links in scottish parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The owner – known only as Mr Chang – came up with the hilarious idea after an elderly neighbour said she didn’t feel safe without his customers about.

Stute also drew a blank in terms of goals for the seventh time in that period, and with Warrenpoint grabbing a late win at Carrick, the Blues have now slipped to last place after several weeks of treading water.It is a concerning time for Connor and his and with a game against the Point just a few weeks away, they will be hoping to get a win out of somewhere before that huge six-pointer.Whilst Stute improved in the second half of Saturdays game, they did not do enough to test home goalkeeper Conor Byrne throughout, and not for the first time this season, indiscipline in their own penalty area cost them as they conceded yet another penalty. Connor made a number of changes as he tried to freshen things up, bringing in Conor Tourish, Cormac Burke and Ahu Obhakhan for Evan Tweed, Oran Brogan and Alex Pomeroy, who all dropped to the bench.New signing Obhakhan almost gted Dungannon a goal as early as the fourth minute as his pass found Caolan McAleer, but the ex-Finn Harps mans long range drive failed to trouble Stute goalkeeper Rory Brown. The last two games between these sides had been memorable for all sorts of reasons, but this was not following suit as both teams struggled for inspiration, half chances falling for Dungannon as Terry Fitzpatricks tame effort was easily gathered by a ing Brown before the Stute goalkeeper saved from Hughes from distance. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -Stute upped their efforts after the break and they finally tested the hosts when Joe McCreadys low drive was saved at the second attempt by Swts keeper Byrne.That was the beginning of the best period in the game for the visitors and just before the hour mark Currys header from Burkes left wing corner caused problems for Swts, who somehow scrambled the ball awya from danger. Stutres vulnerability at set-plays cost them dearly just after the hour mark when Dungannon finally broke through, McAleers cross finding King at the back post who powerfully headed home. That changed the momentum of the game and the lead was doubled just over ten minutes later when Tourish brought down McAleer inside the box, leaving referee Tony Clarke with no option but to point to the spot. Douglas Wilson made no mistake with the resulting penalty, drilling the ball low into Browns bottom left hand corner to seal the points. Stute had no answer and Swts should have added a third when Hughes fed an unmarked McAleer, but with only Brown to beat, the winger fired wide with the goal at his mercy.In the closing stages Gareth Brown went close to grabbing a consolation as his snap-shot beat Byrne but flashed just wide. googletag.cmd.push TeamsDungannon Swts: Byrne, Lowe, Wilson, King, Teggart Campbell, Fitzpatrick , Smyth , McAleer Carvill, Hughes .Institute: R Brown, Morrow, Tourish, D Curry, McLaughlin G Brown, McCauley , Crown, BurkeMcCready , Obhakhan.Referee: Tony Clarke .

He has since signed a deal at the club until the end of  season, and admitted that once McCourt reached out, he agreed to come to the Candystripes almost immediately.“This is a big step for me and hopefully I can restart my career here and of course bring Derry City as high as possible with some goals. The only thing I knew was Shamrock Rovers because they played in Europe against a Norwegian team. Its a big league which is almost quite as big as Norway so for me it was easy, very easy to say yes and when Paddy sent me the message I said yes almost immediately. I didnt know Paddy but I searched right away so I was a little star struck tright away,” he laughed.Nilson has one tenuous link to Derry City in that one of his former clubs is Fredrikstad, who used to have former City midfielder ciaran Martyn on their books. The striker though is determined that the league he knew little about will certainly remember him when he eventually leaves.“Hopefully the fans can expect goals from me,” he said. “I am all about the box kind of player. Of course I am an all around player but I love to be in the -yard box and thats where the goals are scored so I am going to be there all the time and hopefully I can score a lot of goals.“Of course every footballer wants to play as high as possible. The first step now will be to take Derry City as high as posiible. I have met everyone now and I am looking forward to the first game. It starts at the top against Dundalk andwe are going to end up top three then we have to win those games.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting. The generosity of spirit that local people have displayed since my first appeal continues to be overwhelming..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Red.jpg","title":"Red High back in business  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, booked their place in the MacLarnon Cup play-offs against Carndonagh Community School and are now just one win away from the quarter-finals.The holders didnrsquot start that well as St Louisrsquo grabbed the first two points through Aidan Scullion at the Dub last Wednesday, but as the first half progressed it became clear that St Patrickrsquos were the more accomplished team.Although St Louisrsquo still led at the break by - to -, the writing was on the wall for the mid-Antrim boys with the pace of the Downpatrick wing-forwards and wing-backs, plus the presence of Aodhan Harney, Tom Smyth and Ruairiacute Connor down the centre was always a problem for them.St Louisrsquo looked good in the opening few minutes with Scullion lively and Ruairiacute Hagan and Ryan McQuillan pushing forward, but that penetration was arrested before the end of the first quarter and the scores dried up.Their hopes of remaining in the tie against the strong breeze in the second half rested on a penalty in first half injury-time when Ronan McKillop fed Ryan McQuillan and the Glenravel man was taken down.But Scullion pulled his shot wide from the spot kick and that two points lead did not look good enough.Tom Smyth, Tom Savage, Chris McIlroy and Dermot Donaldson all pointed in the opening six minutes of the second half and the result was not in doubt from then on.Some of these were well taken scores, but the cream of the crop was a seven-player move down the left wing which finished with Conor Murray slinging over the second of his four second half scores in the nd minute.Six minutes later the Red High slammed the door shut on Ballymena.

You have to be able to adapt the set, you look around the room and see what vibe people are into. You have to be very engaged with the audience, read the people. “A lot of the time it’s old and young people so you need a wide range of songs for a wide range of people.Rory, Paul and Stefan with their award“It’s very satisfying for me as a singer to sing all these dferent types of songs. “I’m challenging myself to sing songs that put me out of my comfort zone.“If you want to be good,you want to get better, you have to step out of your comfort zone.”The wedding band that Paul sings with – Infinity – picked up the award for best band in Co Armagh Tyrone at last weekend’s Northern Ireland Wedding Awards.“I’m on a wee bit of a high after winning. You go to these things and don’t expect to win. We’re just about the music and doing a good job, but it was good to be recognised.”Paul, who plays guitar and sings is joined in Infinity by Rory Madden on piano and Stefan Kelly on drums.He said: “We’re very erse musicians. You have to be. We’re a new breed of wedding band. We’re trying to change it up a bit.MOT test temporary exemptions outlined by Infrastructure Minister to drivers whose certicates have expiredPolice thank public for their assistance after missing -year-old girlfound Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I’d moved away for many years and then when I came back about five years ago I was still pushing the solo thing. “Myself and Rory had both worked professionally, but we saw an opening and said, ‘let’s start a wedding band together’. We’ve never looked back.“What we’ve been doing for the past four years is building Infinity up.“We play at a professional level. There’s no corners cut, we rehearse, we learn new material, we really intricately put songs together, work out first dances.” Askedbeing in a wedding band pays well, Paul said: “I can’t disclose that but we do okay. We put a lot of money back into advertising, into making music videos.” Paul lives in Aghalee where he has his own music studio: “I’m getting into the production of music – for the band, for myself and helping other singers. I’ve got a lot of experience as a singer so hopefully I can help others. I’ve loved being a listener as well as a singer.”As a producer Paul has put together a number of music videos for Infinity which the band use to showcase their abilities to potential customers, that is, brides and grooms to be.Not unlike the mainstream music industry wedding bands are trying to stand out from the crowd and land regular headline slots.Paul said: “The wedding industry is massive. There’s a lot of competition. We have to step it up. We’re always pushing to be better. “We make music videos so people can see what we do. One of the first songs we recorded was a cover of Ed Sheeran’s Perfect. People wanted to book us for their wedding because of that promotional video.“It put us on the map a little bit. Ed Sheeran isn’t all bad.“Perfect has been the most popular songs for a first dance in the last couple of years.”Discussing first dances, Paul said: “We have a massive repertoire of slow songs, hopefully the bride and groom pick something that we do really well. If not there’s the challenge of preparing a stripped back version of their favourite songs that’s suitable for a first dance.“That’s the thing about first dances. Sometimes you’re learning a song you’ll only sing once. “I remember being asked to do a rave song for a first dance. It was Set You Free by N-Trance. I thought, ‘phew, how am I going to do a rave song for a first dance ’ In the end you just have to look at the chord structure, slow it down. We did it with just piano and vocals, it was really pretty. I’ll probably never sing it again so I guess you had to be at that particular wedding.”He continued: “We’re looking all the time at what’s doing well, what’s popular, what are people reacting to, what kind of groove are people dancing to.“You can’t beat the old songs like Walk Of Le, Stevie Wonder, classic rock, Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top. Young and old know that.“In this part of the world you have country music, both American and Irish, and folk music that goes down well.“We leave Rock The Boat to the DJ.”Paul said he was just as comfortable being a wedding singer as he was as a solo artist: “I get to put on a nice suit and stand on a big stage in front of three or four hundred people.“It is great to be on stage and see all those people dancing, having the time of their lives in front of you.“You’re making it happen, that’s my job. That’s what we have to do, that’s what we strive to do well.“For me, what’s the alternative, to try and be a great artist and never make it  I’d rather be in the music business, be working as a musician, to me that’s the most important.“There’s regular work as a wedding band. We can be looking at  to  weddings a year.“As a musician I’ve done all sorts of gigs, sometimes you could be in a room of  people and those people could just be loving everything you’re doing. Other times it can be tough. I don’t mind because I love playing music.“Just because you’re playing a wedding doesn’t guarantee people will be up dancing. You become a good improviser, you need topeople aren’t dancing.”Paul said to be in a wedding band you had to rethink your priorities: “As a wedding singer you have to be adaptable. I can’t be saying. ‘this is what I like, I don’t care what you like’. It’s not about me, it’s about me trying to do the job well. The same for the other guys in the band.”He added: “It’s never completely comfortable. There’s always a bit of pressure. Then you’ve got the camera stuck in your face as well. You’re part of the wedding. There’s no room for mistakes.”Paul said that almost all his weekends were spent on the road with the band.He said: “Thursday to Sunday you’re out on the road and during the busier months of the year you could be doing a wedding on a Monday night, Tuesday night.“We do the odd full day wedding. I’ll sing an acoustic set in the afternoon then a big set at night. Those are harder and harde to do. If you’re doing three of those in a row you’re getting no sleep and your show’s going to be affected by that.“Most of the time we’ll do a two or two and half hour live show and there’s an hour disco from Rory afterwards. We find that we’re there for the whole night. That’s our usual package.“You play to am. You’re getting home at four in the morning a lot of the time depending where you’re playing. We do a lot of gigs in Donegal and Monaghan, Dundalk, Drogheda, down the Athlone, the Midlands area. It’s a few extra hours on the road, but we’ll not rule anywhere out.“It’s a le we’re well used to. What  would you be doing ”Reflecting on the change in his musical career Paul said: “As a solo artist who had management and was bringing out singles I just didn’t get lucky, it can come down to who you know and not how good you are.“I feel like I’m a better singer now, being in a wedding band, working so much and pushing myself so much to be good at what I do has made me better.“I feel more confident in myself now, people probably respect me a bit dferently as a wedding singer. I’m working all the time. I’m very dedicated to what I do. I don’t drink, don’t smoke.“What’s the alternative  Go and try to be the next Lewis Capaldi. Yes, you can try but the chances are you’ll be doing a gig every other week and have no money.”He said: “You need to leave your ego in the house, for me it’s just about going out and playing good music. It’s all about that crowd, making their day, making that bride and that groom and their family happy.“We’ve all been to those weddings were the band have been awful, it’s been a real drag. We striving to not be that band. It’s a wedding. People should be having the night of their lives.”Askedhe attending any weddings other than those he sings at, he said: “I’ve been at a few family weddings but I’ll be with the band. Infinity will play their wedding, that’s my gt to them.”He added: “I’ve never married. I’m married to the music. If I ever did I’d have to play my own wedding. I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. At the minute I wouldn’t even have the time to get married.”try catch  TrendingNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall for next week - subzero temperatures expected across NINI snow alert: Snowfall and ice worse than originally thought - Met Office issue yellow status warning - temperatures to plummet to bitterly cold -degC with risk of gale-force winds tooTwo PSNI officers in hospital after horric attack        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

so far at least - has not translated into higher spending.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"ni road closed after collision motorists asked seek alternative route ","story":"Billy Wright and Robin Jackson were ‘state agents’ claims BBC documentaryLodges break ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelNI road closed after collision -

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in.
