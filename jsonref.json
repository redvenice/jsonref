Critics can\u0027t help but notice that Robin Wright\u0027s stellar solo-lead performance (right) still can\u0027t help the show from escaping the dank shadow of Kevin SpaceyAt the moment, the sixth season has scored 81 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and has average rating of just 63.7 per cent. The general consensus amongst viewers is that the show spends too much time addressing what happened to Frank and the ramifications of his absence. IndieWire said that the focus on Frank fallout \u0027undercuts\u0027 the numerous \u0027women-first stories,\u0027 causing the season to appear \u0027stagnant.\u0027The sentiment was shared by Variety who stated that Frank\u0027s absence left the season \u0027scrambling\u0027 when it came to to a plot. But almost all viewers have been praising the additions of Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear - who play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedly. Other stellar performances are also consistently referenced, including Patricia Clarkson.Before you binge watch House of Cards\u0027 sixth season, here is what you need to know!House of Cards reviews IndieWire  \u0027More than half the final season passes before “House of Cards” feels like Claire Underwood’s (Robin Wright) story instead of his epilogue, and even when she starts to see her vision borne out, the lingering questions are all about Frank,\u0027 the review stated. \u0027Despite the hype, Season 6 isn’t Claire’s show. It’s still Frank’s, which undercuts the season’s many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.\u0027 They added that the show started to feel a lot like a \u0027murder-mystery\u0027 - but not exactly in a good way.  \u0027Seeing it this way provides a bit of goofy levity to a series always toeing the line between pompous prestige and soapy melodrama, even if the story’s morbid obsession with how Frank died sparks bad memories of “This Is Us,” Jack Pearson, and a slow-cooker. The review did praise the performance of Patricia Clarkson as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade Jane Davis.           The cast at the season six premiere on October 22 It said: \u0027 After joining the cast in Season 5, the Oscar nominee  operates on another level than the rest of the cast — another show, even.\u0027About the show\u0027s shortcomings, Indiewire said: \u0027When Claire addressed the camera and said, “My turn” and all but erased her camera-whore hubby from control, there was no reason the audience should believe otherwise. \u0027Instead, five of the eight final episodes over-emphasize his importance and fail to create arcs worthy of Wright’s talents or Claire’s iniduality. Worse yet, they weaken the show’s conscious effort to highlight the discrimination facing female politicians.\u0027  IndieWire gave the season a C Plus grade.Entertainment Weekly  Entertainment Weekly rated the season much higher, at a B Plus, and praised the direction the series went with women in politics.  \u0027In its final season, House of Cards wants to imagine a scenario where women are the ones who rule the world — but instead of making it a better place, they are as cutthroat, venal, and wholly nihilistic as the legions of men who have come before,\u0027 they said.EW also relished in the opportunities \u0027actresses in their midlife prime\u0027 had at commanding their scenes throughout the show.  Their highest praise was saved for Wright, where they said: (about Claire) The final season of House of Cards belongs to her, and more importantly, Wright herself. \u0027Sporting perfectly-tailored, military-style suits and dresses, her sleek blonde bob shielding her head like a helmet, Wright brings more humor to Claire than ever before as the President exploits sexist stereotypes about female hysteria\u0027As the sly nods to Lysistrata and Sylvia Plath’s Lady Lazarus attest, behind President Underwood’s feminist facade is a warrior set on nothing less than complete patriarchal destruction.\u0027 NPRNPR seemed the most pessimistic about the direction that the show went in its sixth season, claiming that the first five episodes \u0027reveal just how tiresome the show\u0027s machinations have become.\u0027They were quick to praise the performance of the supporting cast in the absence of Casey.\u0027The performances here are wonderful, especially Kinnear as controlling power broker Bill Shepherd and Lane as Annette Shepherd — whose rivalry with Claire is tangible and toxic,\u0027 the review stated.          Diane Lane is playing Annette Shepherd (right). She and Claire Underwood are longtime frenemies in the showTheir review did blast real world implications especially the workings of the Trump Administration and the timing of the show\u0027s release.\u0027Scheduled to drop Nov. 2, days before a hotly contested midterm election, this show features an array of Washington power brokers working to disguise their shady machinations from the public eye,\u0027 the review said. \u0027In real life, however, the dysfunction of the Trump White House seems an open book, with new scandals erupting in the press or from the campaign trail every day.\u0027 NPR added: \u0027Partisanship fuels everything in real-life politics, which has always made House of Cards feel a bit like a dark fantasy where America\u0027s biggest problems are unscrupulous politicians of every stripe — not the tribalism and propagandizing that destroys consensus on the most basic facts across party lines.\u0027 UproxxUproxx touted the show as being \u0027definitely better\u0027 and added that giving Claire \u0027more power and more responsibility is a step in the right direction.\u0027 But then listed a series of critiques on various elements of the plot and production.The review stated: \u0027A lot of the same general problems are lingering about. The show still takes itself entirely too seriously for something as pulpy and crazy as it is on paper.\u0027Share this articleThey also wrote that that plot was \u0027too much.\u0027  \u0027House of Cards is off to a much better start this season, thanks in large part to the notable subtraction and subsequent elevation of its stars, but it is still very much House of Cards, different in good ways but still the same in the bad ones,\u0027 Uproxx added.           Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear (right) play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedlyThe AtlanticThe Atlantic also praised performances while blasting the plot. They said: \u0027Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering.\u0027In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implications.Unfortunately, it isn’t until more than halfway through the eight-episode season that Claire’s big plan becomes clear. When it does, it involves Wright making a hammy, malevolent parody of gendered expectations, brilliantly puncturing the gunmetal patina that’s fallen upon the show and helping bury the memory of Frank’s excesses. The plot surely must hurl toward doom, but a deeper tragedy is suggested: if only this woman never had to hide her true self.          In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implicationsVariety Variety felt that Robin Wright\u0027s Claire was truly coming into her own in the show\u0027s sixth season, adding that \u0027the spotlight suits her.\u0027 \u0027The clever thing “House of Cards” does early in its sixth season is not to cover for Frank Underwood’s absence but to use it to emphasize the fundamental isolation in Claire’s character,\u0027 the review read. \u0027The chilly desire to alienate others so that, human contact having been taken out of the equation, things can get accomplished.\u0027 But Variety did chime in with the feeling that the show wasn\u0027t able to pull away from Frank and Spacey\u0027s \u0027gravitational pull.\u0027  The review added:  \u0027The show, one that’s wildly changed narrative course many times even without pragmatic real-world reasons at stake, seems surprisingly confused about how to reboot. \u0027In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, “House of Cards” is a ride when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge.

It marked a major turning point in our politics. Since the financial crisis, the British people have worked hard to fix the damage caused by Labour’s great recession.That hard work is now paying off. This Budget sets a clear course towards a brighter and more prosperous future for everyone in the United Kingdom. It shows that responsible Conservative management of the economy allows us to invest more in our vital public services while also cutting taxes – a win-win for working people.Getting here has not been easy. The whole world faced a financial shock in 20072008. But the UK suffered more than most countries because of Labour’s economic mismanagement. Labour arrogantly claimed to have ‘abolished boom and bust’ – just as their failed regulation of the banks set us on the road to ruin.    Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the House of CommonsWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May says that the NHS is \u0027personal\u0027 for her and she uses it everydayAs a result, our deficit soared to a post-war record, nearly three quarters of a million jobs were lost and Britain was on the brink. In eight years, that situation has been transformed and we are now at a turning point. Our debt has begun its first sustained fall for a generation and the difficult years of austerity are now coming to an end.In the Budget we saw what that means for the British people.At its heart was our absolute commitment to the public service that the British people value the most: our NHS. This is personal for me. Just like millions of people across our country, I rely on the NHS every day. The wonderful staff of my local NHS trust in Berkshire help me manage my diabetes so I can live a normal life and get on with doing my job.As Prime Minister, I am determined to do what it takes to secure our NHS for the future so it is there for all of us.She also said that, as Prime Minister, she is determined to do what it takes to secure the NHS for the future so it is there for everyoneThat is why we made the largest- ever cash commitment to our public services by a peacetime government: an extra £394 million every single week. The NHS is the public’s priority – and it is my priority too.However, simply increasing budgets without a proper plan to improve outcomes is not enough. That was Labour’s mistake. So, in return for our investment, the NHS is working on a new long-term plan to make sure that every penny makes a difference for patients.That plan will be published shortly, but we can already see its first fruits. A new Cancer Strategy will save thousands of lives by prioritising early diagnosis. A new mental-health crisis service will provide expert support in schools and hospitals, so help is on hand when people need it.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement on the Brexit negotiations following a European Union summit in Salzburg, at no 10 Downing Street, central London on September 21Today, in the year of the NHS’s 70th birthday, we are securing its future with our record cash investment and a long-term plan to drive up outcomes for patients. Labour went into the last Election offering to spend less on the NHS than the Government is investing now. In its 2017 manifesto, Labour offered 2.2 per cent more every year of this Parliament. Our new settlement provides substantially more – an average of 3.4 per cent over the next five years. Conservatives have cared for the NHS for most of its life and we are setting out a path for it to prosper for another 70 years and more.She also said that Jeremy Corbyn and his party do not understand that the way to build a stronger economy that works for working people is by backing businesses to create more jobsIt is clear that in British politics today, the Conservatives are now the natural party of the NHS.And our Conservative commitment to the NHS means this extra funding is being met not by putting up taxes, but by managing our economy responsibly. Thanks to the hard work of the British people, the deficit is now a fraction of what it was under Labour and we are no longer borrowing anything at all to fund day-to-day spending.In time, as our debt continues to fall, that will mean we pay less and less on debt interest, saving taxpayers’ money. Employment is at a near-record high and unemployment is at its lowest rate since the 1970s and that means we are spending less on benefits. Instead, as more people earn a wage, more businesses make a profit and more foreign investment comes into the UK, our tax receipts are higher, giving us more money to spend.That means alongside more investment for our public services, we can also cut taxes for working people. At the Budget, alongside freezes in fuel, beer and spirit duties, we also brought forward an income tax cut for 32 million people, putting more money in the pockets of working families.Astonishingly, Jeremy Corbyn refused to support these tax cuts. He and his party simply do not understand that the way to build a stronger economy that works for working people is by backing businesses to create more jobs, taking a responsible approach to public spending and keeping taxes low.Proof of this is his plan for a £1,000 billion spending spree funded by higher taxes on working people and more borrowing. This would devastate our economy. Jobs would be lost, taxes and borrowing would rise, and public services would end up having to face new Labour cuts. After ten years of hard work, Britain would be back at square one.Over the past decade, our focus was on dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis. Over the next decade, our challenge must be to seize the opportunities of the future and ensure that everyone benefits. Because the Conservatives are not just a party to fix a mess, we are also a party to steer a course to a better future.Leaving the European Union with a good deal, creating new jobs and getting the most out of new technology through our Modern Industrial Strategy, taking a responsible and balanced approach to our economy that keeps our national debt falling, our public services improving, people’s wages rising and their taxes low. That is the brighter future Conservatives offer the British people: a country that truly works for everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"Hour hour whats happening Britian Armistace Day","story":"Prince Charles (right)  is expected to lay the first Royal tribute during the Remembrance Service at 11am and as the evening draws in  1,200 buglers (left) will play The Last Post across the country          The current cenotaph was unveiled in 1920 (pictured) and a million people flooded past.

And it has endeared her to him even more.’Those closest to Charles draw a parallel between Meghan’s dignified forbearance in the face of hurtful comments from relatives, and how the Prince stoically endured public criticism from Princess Diana.‘Whatever they felt inside, they’ve both put on a strong public face and not hidden away,’ said another source.The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle in place of her absent father, has delighted Prince Harry and senior members of the Royal Family. It is an understanding that has been further strengthened by a shared love of art, history and culture, with Charles describing Meghan as ‘incredibly smart’.Charles and Meghan’s bond is revealed in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today by Royal biographer Angela Levin, who spent a year following the Prince ahead of his 70th birthday later this month.    The Prince’s close rapport with Meghan, whom he walked down the aisle (pictured) in place of her absent father, is said to have delighted Prince HarryCamilla has also warmed to Meghan. ‘Not least because both of them have joined the Royal Family from the outside,’ said a source. ‘Camilla goes out of her way to find time to spend with her, to get to know her and make her feel welcome.’As the tour of Australasia demonstrated, The Duchess’s transition from actress to high-profile Royal has been seamless – something that has gladdened Charles, who believes her Hollywood training has enabled Meghan to withstand intense scrutiny.In addition to the Event profile, The Mail on Sunday has learned from separate sources of a Scottish holiday enjoyed by Charles and the newlyweds over the summer.Charles entertained Harry and Meghan at the Castle of Mey, the late Queen Mother’s remote home in Caithness, telling friends he was ‘tickled pink’ when they agreed to join him. He also invited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but they declined.Sources said Charles told a member of his family that the week with his son and daughter-in-law was ‘joyous’. There were coastal walks and a spot of bird watching.‘I think it’s fair to say that Meghan has brought Harry and Charles closer, and Charles is thrilled to have a new daughter-in-law.‘Camilla wasn’t there, she was enjoying a bucket-and-spade holiday with her own children and grandchildren, so I think that made it even more special for Charles.’Meanwhile, Levin paints a portrait of a man who is settled, content and happy – more so than he has been for years. Marriage to Camilla - whom he frequently describes as ‘my darling wife’ – arrested his tendency to melancholy, particularly evident in the bleak period following the death of Princess Diana when his popularity plummeted and many said he was not fit to be King.  As Prince Charles prepares to turn 70, Event reveals a stunning photo album packed full of remarkably intimate pictures documenting his life from a royal baby to his life today as a doting grandfather Event brings you a colourful insight into the life of a prince with photos of Charles in his mother\u0027s arms, on tour around the world and  sharing tender moments with his wife Camilla          Princess Anne holds a bunch of daffodils as Prince Charles stands guard over a plant in 1954          The eight-month-old Prince makes an early play for the Crown Jewels as Royal mother and son share a tender moment in the garden of Windlesham Moor, Surrey, in July 1949, where the family lived for two years as they waited for a major refurbishment of Clarence House to be finished          Elizabeth counts her blessings as a parent while the baby Prince counts the balls on his abacus in an outdoor playpen in the grounds of the rented Windlesham Moor, a five-bedroom country house in Sunningdale with two guest rooms combined to make a nursery          Charles reaches for his rabbit which, along with a teddy, some yellow ducks, a submarine and an elephant on wheels called Jumbo, were his favourite first toys.

It marked a major turning point in our politics. Since the financial crisis, the British people have worked hard to fix the damage caused by Labour’s great recession.That hard work is now paying off. This Budget sets a clear course towards a brighter and more prosperous future for everyone in the United Kingdom. It shows that responsible Conservative management of the economy allows us to invest more in our vital public services while also cutting taxes – a win-win for working people.Getting here has not been easy. The whole world faced a financial shock in 20072008. But the UK suffered more than most countries because of Labour’s economic mismanagement. Labour arrogantly claimed to have ‘abolished boom and bust’ – just as their failed regulation of the banks set us on the road to ruin.    Prime Minister Theresa May speaks during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the House of CommonsWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May says that the NHS is \u0027personal\u0027 for her and she uses it everydayAs a result, our deficit soared to a post-war record, nearly three quarters of a million jobs were lost and Britain was on the brink. In eight years, that situation has been transformed and we are now at a turning point. Our debt has begun its first sustained fall for a generation and the difficult years of austerity are now coming to an end.In the Budget we saw what that means for the British people.At its heart was our absolute commitment to the public service that the British people value the most: our NHS. This is personal for me. Just like millions of people across our country, I rely on the NHS every day. The wonderful staff of my local NHS trust in Berkshire help me manage my diabetes so I can live a normal life and get on with doing my job.As Prime Minister, I am determined to do what it takes to secure our NHS for the future so it is there for all of us.She also said that, as Prime Minister, she is determined to do what it takes to secure the NHS for the future so it is there for everyoneThat is why we made the largest- ever cash commitment to our public services by a peacetime government: an extra £394 million every single week. The NHS is the public’s priority – and it is my priority too.However, simply increasing budgets without a proper plan to improve outcomes is not enough. That was Labour’s mistake. So, in return for our investment, the NHS is working on a new long-term plan to make sure that every penny makes a difference for patients.That plan will be published shortly, but we can already see its first fruits. A new Cancer Strategy will save thousands of lives by prioritising early diagnosis. A new mental-health crisis service will provide expert support in schools and hospitals, so help is on hand when people need it.          Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement on the Brexit negotiations following a European Union summit in Salzburg, at no 10 Downing Street, central London on September 21Today, in the year of the NHS’s 70th birthday, we are securing its future with our record cash investment and a long-term plan to drive up outcomes for patients. Labour went into the last Election offering to spend less on the NHS than the Government is investing now. In its 2017 manifesto, Labour offered 2.2 per cent more every year of this Parliament. Our new settlement provides substantially more – an average of 3.4 per cent over the next five years. Conservatives have cared for the NHS for most of its life and we are setting out a path for it to prosper for another 70 years and more.She also said that Jeremy Corbyn and his party do not understand that the way to build a stronger economy that works for working people is by backing businesses to create more jobsIt is clear that in British politics today, the Conservatives are now the natural party of the NHS.And our Conservative commitment to the NHS means this extra funding is being met not by putting up taxes, but by managing our economy responsibly. Thanks to the hard work of the British people, the deficit is now a fraction of what it was under Labour and we are no longer borrowing anything at all to fund day-to-day spending.In time, as our debt continues to fall, that will mean we pay less and less on debt interest, saving taxpayers’ money. Employment is at a near-record high and unemployment is at its lowest rate since the 1970s and that means we are spending less on benefits. Instead, as more people earn a wage, more businesses make a profit and more foreign investment comes into the UK, our tax receipts are higher, giving us more money to spend.That means alongside more investment for our public services, we can also cut taxes for working people. At the Budget, alongside freezes in fuel, beer and spirit duties, we also brought forward an income tax cut for 32 million people, putting more money in the pockets of working families.Astonishingly, Jeremy Corbyn refused to support these tax cuts. He and his party simply do not understand that the way to build a stronger economy that works for working people is by backing businesses to create more jobs, taking a responsible approach to public spending and keeping taxes low.Proof of this is his plan for a £1,000 billion spending spree funded by higher taxes on working people and more borrowing. This would devastate our economy. Jobs would be lost, taxes and borrowing would rise, and public services would end up having to face new Labour cuts. After ten years of hard work, Britain would be back at square one.Over the past decade, our focus was on dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis. Over the next decade, our challenge must be to seize the opportunities of the future and ensure that everyone benefits. Because the Conservatives are not just a party to fix a mess, we are also a party to steer a course to a better future.Leaving the European Union with a good deal, creating new jobs and getting the most out of new technology through our Modern Industrial Strategy, taking a responsible and balanced approach to our economy that keeps our national debt falling, our public services improving, people’s wages rising and their taxes low. That is the brighter future Conservatives offer the British people: a country that truly works for everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"30 year old asylum seeker accused lying 15 bombarded girl texts","story":"This Snapchat post has led to the school referring the 15-year-old boy (pictured) to the Home Office to check his age after students claimed he had said he was 30          Stoke High School on Friday pulled the boy out of class as they try to determine his age\u0027How is there a THIRTY-year-old man in our maths class?\u0027...Ex-Afghan asylum seeker, 31, who pocketed almost £30,000 in...Christian woman cleared of blasphemy in Pakistan prepares to...Share this articleStaff told the year 11 pupil that the girl did not welcome his attention.It is thought the 6ft 1in Iranian claimed to be 15 years old when he arrived in the UK via Germany.

DAWN RAID: Police watch as protesters are evicted from an under-threat park in DeptfordCampaigners who have been occupying their local park for two months in an effort to save it from developers were evicted last week in a dawn raid by dozens of bailiffs.The officials stormed Old Tidemill Wildlife Garden in Deptford, South-East London, at 6am and demanded that activists leave immediately.The protesters had pledged to chain themselves to trees to thwart an eviction notice from Lewisham Council. But more than a week after the deadline, they were caught by surprise. Local resident Harriet Vickers said: ‘Two coachloads of bailiffs charged straight in. There was no liaising. They didn’t give people the chance to leave.’ There were also scuffles as the bailiffs, some wearing masks, surrounded the park to keep people away. Police stood by to prevent a breach of the peace.The half-acre garden – and the adjoining Reginald House social housing block – is part of a site where 209 homes are planned.Critics are unhappy that only 47 per cent of the properties will be classed as affordable.                           Don\u0027t ruin life-saving \u0027natural health service\u0027 Comment by Sir Malcolm Grant, Chairman of NHS England           Chairman of NHS England Sir Malcolm Grant also backed The Mail on Sunday\u0027s crusadeGrowing up in New Zealand, I spent lots of time outdoors in spectacular countryside. There, long-distance walking – or ‘tramping’ – is a national pastime.I came to England in 1972 and have kept up the walking, recently completing the Capital Ring – 78 miles around London.The route passes through lots of London’s parks and green spaces but, sadly, many were largely empty. We seem to have fallen out of love with our parks.This is a worry for the NHS as parks are our ‘natural health service’ offering endless opportunities for us to live longer, happier, healthier lives.Many of our cities have extensive green spaces. They should be full of people enjoying sports, walking dogs and playing games. But poorly maintained parks and green spaces do little to invite walking or play.Parks can play a critical role in keeping us healthy – but only if they are kept open and maintained to high standards that make them places we actually want to visit.Instead, our waistlines are expanding as we choose sedentary lifestyles that place a huge burden on our health. Six million people over 60 live with two or more long-term conditions. Obesity – which can lead to type 2 diabetes and 13 types of cancer – is on the rise. Many of these conditions are not inevitable but are associated with the way we live. And they are a heavy burden on taxpayers.I have spent decades in planning and we all know well-designed neighbourhoods, towns and cities help us lead healthier lives.It is essential to raise the nation’s ambitions a long way above the design of today’s housing estates. We need to design and develop higher-quality places to make it easier for people – especially our children – to live healthier lifestyles. For example, providing safe routes for walking to school or cycling to work and attractive green spaces.Evidence suggests 37,000 premature deaths a year could be prevented through exercise and healthier lifestyles.Health must be at the heart of planning policy and NHS England’s Healthy New Towns programme is leading a new approach. Working with a growing number of developers, we are exploring exciting ways to deliver health and care services.Our ancestors built homes, villages, towns and schools around green spaces. They were central to community life and I believe we need to get back to our heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"Health Secretary calls employers offer free fruit bicycle loans staff","story":"    Matt Hancock (pictured outside Downing Street last week) is urging firms to do more to maintain the health and well-being of their employees The former culture secretary was speaking in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, and in it also urged firms to do more to help ill employees return to work.He said: \u0027The lesson is that employers need to be more engaged when people aren\u0027t well, getting them back to work.\u0027Citing the benefits already in place at the Cornish dairy firm Rodda\u0027s, he said: \u0027It employs 178 staff and places a big emphasis on health and well-being. \u0027Initiatives include free fruit, counselling, bereavement and legal services, cycle to work scheme, and a staff volunteer scheme.\u0027 We\u0027ll ALL pay the price if our parks waste away: Health...Health Secretary orders probe into autistic youngsters...Health Secretary promises crackdown on hospital violence as...Share this articleHis comments come as Philip Hammond announced the biggest public-spending splurge since 2010 – including the £20 billion a year extra for the NHS announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year.Theresa May also today announced that the Conservatives are the \u0027natural party of the NHS\u0027 in an interview with the The Mail on Sunday.This is certainly not the first time Mr Hancock has mentioned improving health in the workplace. Earlier this month he said workers should stand at their desks and hold stand-up meetings to increase their exercise levels.

Constantly checking social media, making it impossible to concentrate on a task at hand? Disconnecting and eliminating disruption could be just what you needFrench artist Paul Cézanne once remarked: “It’s so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.”Today, the challenge is not so much to begin a task, but to complete it. Digital innovators make a virtue of disruption, but their innovations have also had a more literal impact on our lives. Creative technologies have proliferated – you can make an album in your bedroom, write and publish a novel and create and display your artwork – but so have the number of channels vying for your attention.Any project you begin runs the risk of frequent distraction from multiple sources such as the constant, nagging hum of social media updates, group notifications and message alerts.There is no denying the power mobile phones hold over us. There’s even a phenomenon known as “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is the perception that your phone is buzzing when it’s not.It is a daily challenge to shut off the deluge of stimuli and try to focus, to centre yourself and be imaginative. It was the philosopher Aristotle who first put forward the idea of the tabula rasa: the young mind as a blank slate. In the literal sense, nothing relates to this more than the process of beginning to work on an empty page.Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at University of Plymouth, wrote a paper in 2009, where she supported the use of doodling as a cognitive process and aid for reducing daydreaming.Pen and paper are the original, and perhaps the ultimate creative platform, providing a physical connection between the mind and a tool for expression. They fuel the imagination and solidify thought.“There was a study (pdf) that compared students writing on paper and those writing notes on a keyboard, and the former came out better in tests. If you’re typing on your computer, whether you get notifications or not, you’re tempted to look in case there’s something there. You’re pulled away in case there’s an email or something might be happening on Facebook. That doesn’t exist if you use a pen and pad. Those notifications are really disruptive, it’s not just reading them, it’s the time it takes to refocus on the task. That’s a powerful reason to write on paper, whether it be real or digital.”What if there was a medium that provided a bridge between physical writing or drawing and the capability of a digital device, but with none of the disruption? Well, there is. reMarkable is a paper tablet that’s so natural and adaptable that it makes notebooks, sketchbooks and printouts redundant. It offers a paper-like reading, writing and drawing experience in a tactile device that filters out the digital noise around you.“There’s a digital epidemic going on right now. Far too many of us are addicted to checking our social media accounts several times per hour, or worse,” says Magnus Wanberg, founder and CEO of reMarkable. “This is forming our habits in a negative way when it comes to our ability to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. We have based our entire product and company on helping people focus. While most tech companies focus on artificial intelligence, at reMarkable we work to enhance human intelligence. This is why we designed the reMarkable tablet with no distractions or notifications.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

But after the judges of this year’s ObserverCape graphic short story prize had read carefully through the entries, we were all agreed that one had stood out right from the very start: An Artistic Odyssey by Edith Pritchett.Not only did it look great, it also had a beginning, a middle and an end – a harder trick to pull off than you may think over the course of only four pages. Best of all, it was funny. Posy Simmonds thought it was really funny, and she’s one of the most wickedly hilarious people it’s possible to imagine, in person as on the page. (The other judges were, as ever, Dan Franklin, publisher of Jonathan Cape’s graphic novel list, Suzanne Dean, creative director of Vintage Books, Paul Gravett, who runs the Comica festival, and yours truly joining Simmonds as our other special guest was Michel Faber, whose novels include The Crimson Petal and the White and Under the Skin.)But perhaps this shouldn’t have been surprising. As it turns out, the very first graphic novel that Pritchett, a 24-year-old illustrator, ever read was Simmonds’s Gemma Bovery, and it remains a firm favourite (she also loves the New Yorker cartoonists Roz Chast and Edward Steed) no wonder her story comes with a certain Posy-ish waspishness in the matter of modern mores. Inspired by her time at Edinburgh College of Art when she, like most art students, leaned towards the edgy and fantasised about Tracey Emin-style global fame and wealth (her degree show featured a doll she had stitched of herself in the nude), Pritchett’s comic is all bathos. Our heroine dreams, for instance, not of owning some flashy penthouse flat in Manhattan, but of a deckchair for her iPhone. Nor can she bear to take down the poster of Harry Styles from the wall of her studio – not even after she has decided, following a conversion to militant feminism, to devote the space only to heroines such as Frida Kahlo and Gwen John.“I think the cycles she goes through were true of myself and a lot of my peers,” Pritchett says. “A combination of intellectual inferiority and a very keen desire to be important and do something impressive. But I wanted also to try to be honest about my love for pop culture and internet quizzes, as well as my endless yearning for material goods. Perhaps it’s really a confessional piece.” She is “ecstatic” to have won, hoping the prize might help her achieve her long-term dream of making cartoons her living in the future (she’d love to write a weekly strip). In the meantime, she intends to spend (some of) her winnings on “fancy peanut butter”.This year’s runner-up is Jac Clinch, 26, who works as a director and 2D animator at Blinkink animation studios in London. Clinch is recognised for his (also very funny) story Customer Complaint 40569, in which the mixed load setting on a new washing machine causes a tear in the fabric of time and space as a result its owner, Elaine Thrupp, finds herself in the prehistoric savannah approximately 40,000 years ago. Clinch describes it, brilliantly, as a palaeolithic Eat, Pray, Love journey written in the form of a customer complaint letter. “Modern life can leave some of our primal needs unfulfilled,” he says. “But we can’t go back. Thrupp discovers her primal self, but she still can’t let go of that refund she’s owed.”Clinch, whose graduation film from the National Film and Television School, The Alan Dimension, was nominated for a Bafta last year, has been eyeing the ObserverCape prize for a long time (our prize is now 11 years old). “I’ve followed the competition ever since I was a teenager drawing comics in my bedroom,” he says. “I’ve been so inspired by previous winners – and now, as an adult drawing comics in my bedroom, I’m unbelievably chuffed to be runner-up.” His story, which comes with a fantastic punchline, can be read here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983d70f213cf9b8dcd2cdd5b4ced6128d4c61245/952_708_3521_2112/master/3521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0191718c328feb06bb50472591f3a0c1","title":"full disclosure by stormy daniels digested read","story":"‘I got a call saying some big shot dude wanted to meet me. I gave my breasts – Thunder and Lightning – a wake-up call and went over’My phone buzzed. It was my two gay dads calling to tell me the mayor of West Hollywood had declared 23 May to be Stormy Daniels Day. I was so excited I was beyond excited. I sent my two bodyguards, Brandon and Travis, to pick out a dress for me. “Keep in mind I have big boobs,” I said. They came back with a cutout bandage dress that fit perfectly and kept Thunder and Lightning – my nickname for my breasts – in check. Have I mentioned I have breasts? I mean not just breasts, but big breasts?Now I was ready to roll. I guess most of you are just here for the Donald Trump bits. But face it, this book would only be 50 pages at best if that was all I wrote, so bear with me while I tell you my early life story. My parents were both trainwrecks. The kindest thing they ever did was to neglect me and I grew up dirt poor in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. My breasts were not that noticeable when I was born. I didn’t really notice Thunder and Lightning until I was much older.That’s kinda it really. I was a smart kid – I got straight As in all classes. But because we had no money, no one paid any attention to me, apart from this one creepy guy who abused both me and my only friend. But I don’t want to make a big deal of it. Sure it was depressing, but that kind of thing went on a lot in the south and we just accepted it.The first guy I kissed died soon after. The second guy I kissed got murdered. So as you can imagine, I was nervous about kissing any other guys. But then my breasts grew a bit and one thing led to another and soon I was having the time of my life dancing in topless bars and appearing in porno films.OK, so this is the bit you’ve been waiting for. The money shot. One day, as I was just coming off set having had sex with a few well-hung guys – come on, what’s not to love? – I got a call saying that some big shot dude wanted to meet me in his hotel and was willing to pay me shedloads of cash for the pleasure. I checked my diary, gave Thunder and Lightning a quick wake-up call and went on over. Imagine my surprise when I found it was the weird bloke off The Apprentice.Donald Trump was lying on his bed wearing nothing but a white undervest and stained white Y-fronts watching a programme about sharks. “Come and join me,” he said, patting the bed. “I like your big breasts, bigly.” At that stage, I had no thoughts about having sex with him, but he asked nicely so I lay back and let him. So you want to know about his cock? Well, let me tell you it wasn’t quite the smallest I had ever seen, though it sure wasn’t big. But it was shaped like some kinda weird mushroom. So there we were, Donald lying on top of me for all of 10 seconds before shouting, “You’re the bestly, best” – and coming noisily.And that was it. He then invited me to be on Celebrity Apprentice. And promised to fix it so that I would win. I was quite tempted and we talked some more but we could both see it was never going to happen. “Ah well,” he said. “I guess that means we’ll have to stick with that Piers Moron moron.”To be honest, I forgot all about Trump for a while after that as I was too busy working on my career. First I went to have Thunder and Lightning made even bigger – aren’t they great? – then I orced a couple of guys I’d forgotten I had married. It was late one summer evening that I met Glen, the drummer for the world famous rock band, Hollywood Undead. They’d had a huge success in 1998 with I Love You to Bits, Let Me Fondle Your Tits, which reached number 219 in the Albuquerque AOR charts.Glen and I hit it off immediately. I loved hearing about how groupies used to offer to give him blow jobs in car parks. I couldn’t believe that was true. Up till then, I had thought people only had sex in porno films. Anyways, we got married and decided to have a child. I told it to Glen straight. If he was going to be a dad, then he had to shape up and star in porno films. Because there was no way if we got orced that he was going to get custody on the grounds that I was an adult actress.For a few years, Glen and I were the happiest couple alive. No two people ever loved each other more. Then I started getting death threats and orders to sign a non-disclosure about having had sex with a toadstool. Well, no one talks to Stormy Daniels like that. Not even the president of the USA. So here it is. The full story. Full disclosure. It’s been a tough few months. But I’m still here. Still performing. My next show is at the Miami Topless a Go-Go on Tuesday and I have 58 more films in development. Life is sweet. Apart from the fact that Glen and I are no longer together. Still. You win some, you lose some. And I’ve still got Thunder and Lightning.Digested read, digested: Storm in a Double-D Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38df349c3adae700cfde91d6d0aa53191acf5cad/0_0_5433_3260/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7f72faf18a2ac2e6e2280f967a07b36","title":"jonathan coe interview middle england","story":"The comic novelist on his latest novel about the EU referendum, his popularity in France and why it’s important to set books in the MidlandsJonathan Coe is the award-winning author of 12 novels, including What a Carve Up! and The Rotters’ Club, both of which were adapted for BBC radio and TV. His new novel, Middle England, is out on 8 November and chronicles the lead-up to and aftermath of the EU referendum.Middle England is set very much in the moment – the last chapter is dated September 2018. How did it evolve?I had this sense, which kicked in just after the referendum in the summer of 2016, that this was an extraordinary moment in British life and it would be a good thing to write a book about it, but I had no idea how to do it. Then I had an epiphany. I had been wanting to revisit the characters from The Rotters’ Club and I thought if I could just take those characters, who I know really well, and make them live through Brexit, let the events take place and impact upon them in one way or another, then maybe I could do it that way.Political correctness is a key theme. One of your characters is suspended from her job as a university lecturer after being accused of transphobia. Her fictional husband thinks political correctness is running out of control. What is your view?As with everything else at the moment, the situation is so fluid and so complicated. In the book, it’s really more about how quickly the crisis escalates these days and how rapidly and loudly it is amplified by social media and then the mainstream media. Students and teachers have always been in conflict but the issues now seem to be so much rawer. That’s the landscape the book tries to show: a country where we can’t seem to agree about anything we’re very tribal and polarised.Your books are much loved in Europe - you have just been made an Officier de L’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France. Why do you think you are so popular there?The French in particular love the British sense of humour – or what they think is the British sense of humour, which is probably more what it was like back in the 1970s. It is also my sense of humour, really. However, I have a sense these days that comedy of the kind we traditionally excel in is actually part of our current problems. You have a figure like Boris Johnson, who has got where he is by being funny, self-deprecating and self-satirising and we all loved that 10 years ago when he was on Have I Got News for You. But now we’re looking at what came out of that and realising maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to treat it all like a joke.Benjamin Trotter, who becomes a Man Booker-longlisted writer in the book, worries about whether it is the task of the novelist to be “engagé” at times like this. What do you think?I do think novels can help us understand what’s going on. But it’s true the audience for novels is fracturing. I think probably the age of the great, white, middle-aged male writer is over and that’s all to the good. The literature coming out of Britain, the range of young writing, is so much more erse and varied now in terms of race and class.You grew up in Birmingham and the Midlands and often return there in your books. Why?I’ve lived in London for 30 years, but I feel you can’t write a book about contemporary England and just set it in London. And because so many of my books have among their themes the idea of nostalgia and how childhood and teenagerhood form you, I often look back to the first 20 years of my life in the Midlands. Also, my mother still lives in the Lickey Hills just outside Birmingham so I go back quite frequently.You’re married with two daughters. How do you manage to write at home in the midst of family life?I often don’t. I’m lucky enough to have friends who live in the countryside and I often borrow their houses to write in. I’ll go away for four or five days at a time and I can write 3,000 words a day easily in that situation.You spend a lot of time on Twitter. Do you turn it off while you write?No. I’m pretty much addicted now. It’s a bit like writing in a virtual cafe. I have it on in the background buzzing away and mostly that’s helpful unless you get sucked into a long conversation.How is it helpful?It stops you feeling too lonely and isolated and cut off. And, by and large, I love having direct contact with readers as long as they’re not too rude. It’s a comforting reminder that there are people out there who you’re writing for, otherwise you can feel you’re doing it in a void.Who would join you for your dream jamming session?It would be a late-night cabaret trio with Kazuo Ishiguro, who is an excellent musician, on guitar and the novelist and historian Miranda Carter, who is also a superb singer of standards and torch songs.What next?Another book I guess, although the intervals between starting new books seem to get longer. I know writers who finish one book on a Friday and start a new one on Monday. I envy that a lot. I have a couple of theatrical projects on the go but writing for the theatre is such a different kind of writing. I’ve realised why so few novelists write plays and so few playwrights write novels. Michael Frayn is unique, I think, in being good at both. But I’ve done 12 books now and I think it is time to branch out in different directions.Any advice in the meantime on how to stay calm in the run-up to Brexit?I’m tempted to advise turning off the news, avoiding the papers, getting off Twitter and generally putting our fingers in our ears. Sadly, though, it’s important to stay informed. So maybe we should just sometimes read PG Wodehouse and watch Some Like It Hot or Victoria Wood videos, to remind ourselves that lightness and jollity can still exist in the world.

But after being held up by a “technical defect” and then a ersion to New York, it did not arrive in London until Sunday 4 November, 77 hours late.The airline put up passengers in a hotel for the night in Orlando and returned them to the aircraft after repairs were made. The flight was erted to New York after a further “minor technical issue”. Passengers said many people were stranded at JFK without information, accommodation or access to food or drink for several hours.Ceri Todd, from Mumbles in Wales, said she was on the flight with her husband and two teenage children, who spent seven hours trying to sleep on the floor of the terminal before being moved to a departure lounge.Describing it as “the journey from hell”, she said there were fire engines on the JFK tarmac when the plane landed but no BA staff to greet passengers. “There was a lack of leadership, a lack of strategy and there didn’t appear to be any plan in place for when things like this happen.”Another passenger, Rosie Slater Watts, said her children had to bed down for more than five hours on a JFK terminal floor. She told the : “We were treated with contempt and like we didn’t matter. When we got on the aborted flight, the customer care manager advised us that they weren’t sure the aircraft had been fixed. No way would we ever use BA again.”BA said in a statement: “We appreciate that this was an exhausting and frustrating experience for our customers, and we have apologised for the long delay to their flight. Customers were rebooked where possible and while there were limited hotel rooms available, our teams on the ground cared for customers in our first class lounge providing bedding, food and drinks to ensure they were comfortable during their stay.”The company said it had been unable to find accommodation for all passengers because the New York marathon meant that hotels were fully booked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/734df025c49055f89a8388df9c4fbaccf80ee235/0_88_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67a1c94a11e625de667ae6b4476ed7b5","title":"wonga compensation claimants may lose out due to automation plan","story":"Administrators winding up payday lender are devising a computer-based tool to decide whether claims are validAdministrators for Wonga, the controversial payday lender which went bust this year, are planning to automate the process of judging thousands of outstanding compensation claims, leading campaigners to voice concerns that some customers could lose out.Accounting firm Grant Thornton is in the process of winding up Wonga, after it collapsed in August under the weight of costly claims for compensation over mis-sold loans.The administrators are planning to create an “adjudication tool” which will automatically decide which claims are valid in order to save on the costs of manual processing, according to documents seen by the .David Clarke, head of policy at Positive Money, a financial campaign group, warned that a computer-based system could put customers at a disadvantage.“After having been mis-sold loans by automated software, Wonga customers may now be forced to appeal to a similar automated system,” he said.“Just as Wonga’s algorithms failed to account for inidual circumstances when making loans in the first place, there are risks that this technology will again fail to take all the relevant factors into account when processing claims, leaving many customers out of pocket.”Stella Creasy, the Labour MP and leading campaigner on payday lending issues, said she was concerned that compensation claimants who are still in debt to Wonga for other loans may lose out.She said: “There is a very real risk those who are owed money by Wonga in compensation for having been lent money irresponsibly may be chased by creditors for this money, whilst losing access to the compensation to which they are entitled.“It’s time the government stepped in to oversee this process to ensure this legal loan shark doesn’t keep ripping off customers even after its demise.”There has been significant interest in acquiring assets from the administration which include its technology, equipment and loan book. Some 60 parties have expressed an interest in the assets, while 27 have signed non-disclosure agreements in order to inspect them more thoroughly, according to the documents.Any buyer of the loan book would not be liable for the compensation claims which sank Wonga, but would be entitled to chase its former customers for debts.The payout to customers entitled to compensation, who rank as unsecured creditors, “will not be the full value of the accepted claim but will be significantly less”, the document said. Nicky Morgan the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial services regulator, must in future cases “prevent consumer detriment before it occurs”, and called for it to limit other forms of high-cost credit as quickly as it can.She added: “The demise of Wonga shows that the business model of many payday loan companies is based on its unfair treatment of customers, many of whom were in vulnerable situations.”When Wonga collapsed it faced more than 24,000 complaints from customers, while another 9,500 are with the Financial Ombudsman Service. Claims have also continued to stream in at a rate of 200 to 500 claims per day after the appointment of administrators on 30 August, according to the letter to creditors, sent on 24 October.The automated process of deciding which claims are valid will be “aligned as closely as possible” to the methodology used by the FOS, the administrators said. The FCA has also been informed of the plans.A spokesperson for Grant Thornton said: “The joint administrators have issued their initial proposals to the companies’ creditors on the progress of the administration. The proposals are currently being considered by the creditors, who have until 9 November 2018 to offer views, and include updates on the trading conditions of the companies and details on other material financial matters.“The administrators are continuing to conduct an orderly wind down of the business in accordance with their statutory obligations and continue to work closely with the Financial Conduct Authority.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6ff9726afbcda0941d979534bbc8cf7b5f3da9/0_49_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4431ef32045c63aaa25fb182778ad66","title":"arron banks brexit democracy 2016 referendum","story":"The modern mind recoils from nuance, detail and reflection. Bombarded with digital information, we seek instant gratification, confuse good public policy with instant customer service, and reserve special contempt for those who would delay the Deliveroo of democracy.So it was no surprise that Arron Banks, the Leave.EU donor now under investigation by the National Crime Agency, framed his interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr as just another pesky metropolitan attempt to confuse and obstruct the supposedly simple matter of Brexit. The harder Marr pressed him on the ultimate source of his £8m loan to the campaign, the more irritated Banks became (“I don’t want to get heated with you”). Any authority or source of information that the presenter cited – the Financial Times, the Electoral Commission, the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee – was instantly dismissed as biased or otherwise tarnished. The most telling remark of the interview was Banks’s disdain for “the number of corrupt MPs who have sat in this seat over the years”.As usual, he postured as the straight-talking tribune of the people, whose will was yet again being challenged by whingeing remoaner liberals. His whole countenance screamed a single complaint: why do you lot have to make things so complicated? Quite how complicated Banks’s financial affairs are, and have been, is now the subject of a criminal investigation. Its outcome ought to be awaited with fretful concern by the Westminster class, with less than five months to go until the UK’s scheduled departure from the European Union.Which is why it has been so depressing to behold the parade of politicians of left and right insisting that the allegations against the insurance and mining tycoon should have no bearing at all upon the way in which we perceive the result of the 2016 referendum. Most ludicrous of all has been the claim of the Corbynite left that social media – the digital campaigning paid for by Banks – played no significant part in the vote for leave. Really? This seems an odd argument, given that the Labour party made extensive use of a specially created social media targeting tool called Promote in the 2017 general election, and that Jeremy Corbyn himself joined Snapchat to record his political travels. Was he wasting his time, too?You don’t have to be a remainer – or you shouldn’t have to be – to be alarmed by the latest disclosures. For more than two years we have been told with bludgeoning certainty that the people have spoken, the verdict is in, the decision is final. But what if the process by which that decision was reached was seriously corrupted?Thanks to the epic work of Carole Cadwalladr and other journalists, a mass of evidence has now accrued that the two main pro-Brexit campaigns were engaged in electoral vandalism, astonishing levels of disinformation and breaches of the law governing referendums. Yes, that evidence is often technical. But is complexity now excluded from the political process and the pursuit of justice? Are we meant to shrug our shoulders and wilfully confuse detail with trivia?The great conflict at the heart of the Brexit process has been the tension between simplicity of feeling and rhetoric on the one hand, and complexity of fact and negotiation on the other. According to the Sunday Times, Theresa May is close to finalising “a secret Brexit deal”. And it is certainly true that a mood of cautious optimism has settled upon the talks. But much still depends upon political and diplomatic issues that are both extremely complicated and immensely significant. How, precisely, would the UK’s continued participation in the EU customs union affect its relationship with the European court of justice? And what sort of “exit clause” to manage our eventual departure from the EU customs union do the negotiators have in mind? Yes, these are technicalities. But so are the working parts of jet engines and the nanotechnology inside an iPhone: and nobody disputes that they’re quite important.But – if you insist, and just for the sake of argument – set Brexit aside. When Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS select committee, met the FBI in Washington DC to discuss its inquiry into fake news and electoral manipulation, he was struck by the extent to which the Feds’ focus had already shifted from the 2016 presidential race to future elections, including this week’s midterm contests. Its message was: defend your democracy against even more aggressive attacks upon its electoral processes. Think of the next general election, which could come at any time. Or – if you truly believe that vote will not be held until 2022 – concentrate on the elections in 270 English local authorities that will be held in May. How safe are those contests from sabotage subsidised by dark money?Banks is only the most spotlit of a new cohort of digital godfathers seeking to use wealth and technology to manipulate our democratic institutions. He is the John Gotti of populist campaigning, a dapper don who relishes his public profile. But there are plenty of others – state actors and private iniduals – who stay out of the limelight and prefer secret power to boisterous publicity.Are we really OK with this? And, to return to Brexit, is our impatience to get on with this total transformation in our institutional and commercial arrangements so all-consuming that we cannot even contemplate a pause for thought? Call me a remoaner. Call me a centrist. Call me an “enemy of the people”. But don’t insult my intelligence by pretending that there is not a noxious stink emanating from the 2016 referendum campaign.And yes: I know that 17.4 million people voted leave. But 16.1 million voted remain, too. When the margin of victory is that slender, little things mean a lot. And the Banks criminal investigation is more than a little thing. Indeed, we long ago reached the critical mass of evidence where a political class of any statesmanship would have had the courage to suspend the Brexit process and establish beyond question that the original 2016 campaign was conducted fairly. This is no time for bovine paralysis or foot-shuffling timidity. If the satnav is leading you off a cliff, and you think it might have been tampered with, is it really an act of treachery to apply the brakes?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ef946b506048ac3ca8f5cd2cdd7d9e1bc6f095/0_167_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802aa76476105a234d7be03550a0a291","title":"freedom of expression religious views","story":"It is hard to manage the tensions that arise when respect for a religion can be thought to constrain expression undulyMuch of the English-language journalism in global news services is generated in increasingly secular societies, and in newsrooms, places that lean towards scepticism and irreverence. But the world is not so secular. Faith and its teachings and rituals play central roles in many lives.A readers’ editor sees how offence over sincerely held religious beliefs can be easily given, and easily taken. Around Easter, for example, Christians might complain about cartoons in which the burdens of a politician are depicted through references to the crucifixion of Jesus. The cartoonist will typically be thinking topically and pictorially, alluding perhaps to great works of western art. There may be no intention to offend. But a readers’ editor soon hears about the outrage or dismay felt by those for whom the New Testament is core belief and Easter a holy time. Examples could be given for Islam and Judaism too.A free-speech scholar, Eric Barendt, summarised one church’s argument in favour of offences against religion and public worship: that “society is entitled to, or perhaps even should, protect a sense of the sacred. Something valuable is lost if there are no restrictions at all on what can be said or written about God or religious belief.” Barendt continued: “This view is of course contestable. Many people, perhaps now a majority in England, live by secular values, and may prefer that the law makes no attempt to protect what they regard as private, rather than shared, values.” Episodes of freedom of expression for some can be perceived by others as an attack on their religion, and respect for a religion can be thought to constrain expression unduly. Managing those tensions through self-regulation will grow, especially in organisations such as the  that serve online a erse global audience. The law is gradually withdrawing from its traditional role as an enforcer of religious orthodoxy. Not totally, or everywhere, but there’s a trend.On 25 October the European court of human rights had cast a different light on the issue. In a controversial decision that shows the continuing potency of laws criminalising speech critical of religious belief, it upheld the Austrian courts’ punishment of a woman for criticising Muhammad, considered by Muslims to be the last of God’s prophets. She was fined €480, or, in default, six months in prison.Named by the court as ES, the woman had been found guilty of “publicly disparaging an object of veneration of a domestic church or religious society, namely Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam, in a manner capable of arousing justified indignation”. In 2009, ES gave a seminar arranged by the rightwing Freedom party and attended by about 30 people. She questioned whether Muhammad was a model for Muslim males to imitate, given that Muhammad had, according to Islamic scholarship she cited, married a girl of six and consummated the union when the girl was nine. ES had rejected her sister’s advice to “say it in a more diplomatic way”, and, the court found, ES “essentially conveyed the message that Muhammad had had paedophilic tendencies”. The court found that ES ought to have put child marriages in historical context. It noted that child marriages used to be widespread among European ruling dynasties.The human rights court found that “a religious group must tolerate the denial by others of their religious beliefs and even the propagation by others of doctrines hostile to their faith, as long as the statements at issue do not incite hatred or religious intolerance”, but ES’s remarks had been capable of arousing justified indignation, were not aimed at contributing to a debate of public interest, and could only be understood as aiming to demonstrate that Muhammad was not a worthy subject of worship.Views will differ about the case. I was struck by the courts’ apparent neglect of scale. One stated rationale for blasphemy offences in the past, and for hate speech laws now, is to limit incitement and to keep the peace. A seminar with 30 self-selecting attendees does not seem a potential mob. No mass audience of Muslims was exposed to what ES said.At the seminar was an undercover journalist. Her employer, a weekly journal called N by the court, informed the public prosecutor, and police questioned ES, who was charged.Journalists sometimes work in mysterious ways.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d582fb5747e4985315f388929bd3e09fe9b2042/0_411_5051_3030/master/5051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07987e8ee124815823ae430e458f981","title":"the guardian view on the us midterms blue wave wanted","story":"The United States midterm elections are always important. But the elections on Tuesday matter in ways that few midterm contests can have matched. Yes, it will take more than one election to mend the damaged and angry political mood that, in the last two weeks alone, has seen a fervent Donald Trump supporter send bombs to several Democrats, and a white supremacist commit the most heinous act of antisemitic violence in the country’s history. The man in the White House is not the only thing that must change. But the journey has to start somewhere. You only have to imagine how much more difficult the journey will otherwise be to grasp the exceptional responsibility that rests on the shoulders of US voters on Tuesday.Donald Trump is not the sole reason why American politics have become so toxic, why Americans’ faith in their institutions has been so shaken, or the influence of the US for good in the world so diminished. In many ways Mr Trump was the product of already existing toxicity, shaken faith and declining prestige. But he has turbo-charged this decline deliberately, as a matter of conscious policy. He seeks consistently to be the president of some of the United States, not of the country as a whole. Against those who do not support or agree with him he deploys only hate and scorn. He lies and provokes as a matter of strategy. This is a president without precedent, and although in the US democracy is strong, it is not indestructible.Take the issue of voting rights. It is often assumed that the US constitution embodies a federal right to vote. It does not. Voting is administered by the states. Most states are in Republican hands, and the districts that will send members of Congress to Washington this week have frequently been gerrymandered. In many states, including North Carolina and Wisconsin, Republicans have imposed restrictions on early voting, postal voting and voter identification, all of them designed to prevent black Americans from voting. In Georgia, officials tried to close seven out the nine voting places in a predominantly black area on the pretext that disabled access was inadequate. The US constitution is celebrated for its checks and balances. Yet partisanship is now so entrenched and unbending that institutions themselves are beginning to creak. The White House is in the hands of a lying and rule-breaking racist executive who, apart from all his policy failings, refuses to release his tax returns, blurs the distinction between official and personal interests, meddles in investigations in which he has no business and who deployed thousands of US troops for a purely partisan reason. Meanwhile, since the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation, the supreme court is now more firmly than ever under partisan rightwing control, opening up the near certainty of an attempt to overturn US abortion rights.So there is a strong constitutional case, as well as a strong political one, for recapturing the legislative branch from its dishonest and sycophantic rightwing Republican leadership. Democratic control of the House of Representatives would constrain Mr Trump by investigating issues that have been shamelessly ignored by the current House leadership. Democratic control of the Senate, a long shot, would clip his wings even more. Democratic failure this week, by contrast, would be – and would be taken to be – an electoral endorsement of Mr Trump.This is a pivotal election for Americans, for American democracy, and for the rest of the world. Yet it comes at a time of decent US economic growth and high employment, when Republicans are energised, and Democrats are ided about their future course. It is far from guaranteed, in the light of 2016, that Democratic enthusiasm and money will turn into the blue wave that we want. But there is no more important political task anywhere in the world today than to seize this moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

He’s made it big in Hollywood, married, had two kids and – despite appearances – has his feet firmly on the ground. So why is he still everyone’s favourite slacker?His overgrown boys have included tech slacker Roy Trenneman, his breakout role in Channel 4’s cult comedy The IT Crowd, record label jerk Ronnie in Judd Apatow’s This Is 40, and an assortment of oafs (not least a bad boyfriend in Girls). But since his turn in Bridesmaids in 2011, O’Dowd has become a regular in Apatow’s Hollywood gang of everymen. It was Apatow who suggested O’Dowd for the role of his latest emotionally stunted male: Duncan, a narcissistic music nerd in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby’s Juliet, Naked.This is the first of two projects with Hornby. “I’m starting to feel like his muse,” he says chuckling, but he’s keen to dis-identify with the Hornby-esque male. “I don’t have the arrested development of his characters,” he insists. “I was brought up in a matriarchal household. My mother is a therapist, so we had mature conversations about behaviour and identity. Hornby characters believe, ‘You are what you like.’ That’s increasingly part of the male psyche as we are clutching for an identity. We were told for centuries that our identity was tied up with machismo and now we are seeing that machismo has a lot of drawbacks.”O’Dowd’s public image as the affable Irishman slacker who merely stumbled into breaking America does not exactly tally with his dynamic CV. But he’s still conscious that “today’s cockerel is tomorrow’s feather duster”. On his writing desk at home in LA he keeps a photo of a “spit bucket” full of 30 half-masticated burgers for an ad he once did, to remind himself that his success is “not just a given”. He admits to suffering less from impostor syndrome than “an Irish inferiority complex. The British can be a bit snooty about Irish people, even now. They’ve seen the danger of the Irish that the Americans haven’t. Americans just see the Irish as jesters.”It doesn’t bother him, he says, that he’s still seen as a comic actor despite a raft of dramas over the last five years. But some things do. In fact he can get quite riled up, for starters, on the subject of Catholicism. In 2014, in John McDonagh’s Calvary, he played a wife-beating butcher wreaking vengeance on the Church for being sexually abused by a priest as a boy. O’Dowd didn’t track down historical Irish victims for his research, he tells me, partly because he already knew so many. “They are not that uncommon. I know many people who priests have exposed themselves to.” He is a vehement atheist, and says the “small turn-out” for Pope Francis’s visit to Ireland in August is “the shape of things to come. For hundreds of years, the Catholic Church provided an identity for Ireland at a time that we were suppressed. The need is no longer there. So if they are going to keep fucking kids, they are in trouble.”The state of oratory is another one of his bugbears: he once wanted to be a political speechwriter. “Theresa May is such a terrible speaker. There’s so much verbosity and such a lack of creativity. Obviously in America, it’s become so juvenile. Taking ideology out of it, the conversation is dumbing because it’s so poor in its execution.” And Brexit: “Increasingly I’m like, ‘Fuck the People. Fuck you, if you didn’t get that they were lying to you.’ It’s like a clown told me a story and I chose to believe it… It’s such a low ebb of human civilisation, a really dangerous time for Anglo-Irish relations. Boris Johnson wants a bridge to Ireland? What’s that going to solve?” Suddenly he stops, worried about moaning.O’Dowd was born in Boyle, County Roscommon, to Seán, a graphic designer, and psychotherapist Denise. He was left to the tyranny of his three sisters at 11, after his older brother left home. They amused themselves by painting make-up on their sleeping brother before sending him to school. As a survival mechanism O’Dowd developed a “big personality” in tandem with his fast-growing body. “I was 6ft tall by the time I was 11. I was a looming, towering figure of ridicule, a high Labrador.” He played Gaelic football for the county. But, he says, he was never a “Jack the lad”. By 13, he was already helping raise his 17-year-old sister’s baby. “I always felt like I was the funny friend of girls that I fancied. I found a position of comfort in that.”By his own account, O’Dowd stumbled into acting after he accompanied a friend to an audition at University College Dublin, where he was studying politics and sociology. He paid his way through drama school with hod-carrying: “It was a very odd time: I’d get up at 5am to work on a building site, then go to a flamenco fucking class.” There followed breaks in theatre, Vera Drake (2004) and a three-year stint on Irish drama The Clinic. But it was his role in The Festival in 2005 that brought him to the attention of Graham Linehan, who was casting for The IT Crowd.Since the series began in 2006, the image of “techies” has gone from basement to virtual rock stars. “Our perception of what IT guys are has changed from Bill Gates to Elon Musk.” He’s not entirely sorry that Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been “getting their comeuppance” recently. “I just think that it’s odd that people who seem so socially stunted have got so much control over our lives.” In 2009 he took a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, where he stumbled upon the “naturalistic” comedy creator Judd Apatow backstage at a Louis CK gig. “I said, ‘Fuck me, that’s Judd Apatow. I think he’s the reason I came over here.”The other life-altering encounter in Los Angeles was with Scottish TV presenter and writer Dawn Porter she changed her name to O’Porter when they married in 2012. There were only brief bachelor days before then, with co-star Jason Segel as his wingman. They once tried to pull the same girl with “verbatim the same text. It said, ‘Why don’t you swing over and we’ll pop open a bottle of vino on the deck.’ We’d been hanging out and drinking a lot, so we must have started sharing a vernacular.”Segel is godfather to O’Dowd’s first son Art, three, brother of one-year-old Valentine, and is a regular at the O’Porter’s weekly Sunday roasts for 20 in West Hollywood. O’Dowd has little tolerance for British clichés about LA. “People think that everyone in LA lives in Beverly Hills and has surgery. It’s the same as when Americans talk about the British as if everybody knows the Queen.”He’s currently in pre-production for Hornby’s State of the Union, a TV series co-starring Rosamund Pike, following a couple in marriage counselling. He was reminded of the salad days of his own marriage while unpacking boxes at their new London home. “We found some tea towels printed with a picture of us dressed as bridezillas for Halloween, and Paul Newman’s saying, ‘Keep the arguments clean and the sex dirty.’ Now everything else is dirty.” Perhaps, despite two kids, Hollywood stardom and twinkling charm, O’Dowd is discovering you can’t have everything.Juliet, Naked is in cinemas now.

We tested it out, asking you to tell us yours. And we were right a barrage of budding or would-be businesses came in. Inventions inspired and outlandish. Things of beauty and utility. Problems solved, gaps filled, and a whole host of things we didn’t know we wanted, but do now.Hundreds of ingenious ideas from imaginative, interested people. And a few that may not make it out of the pub – but not many.We whittled those down, putting the favourites in front of our judging panel – Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Touker Suleyman, eBay’s Kirsty Keoghan, and the ’s Hamish Nicklin – who together chose 15 people, or pairs, with the strongest ideas, plus the passion and commitment to take them forwards. These 15 became the eBay Doers – joining our 10-week incubator aimed at helping people grow those bright ideas into burgeoning businesses with workshops, funding and expert mentorship from entrepreneurs. Say hello to …Johanne-Marie Bonsu – Eden \u0026amp Jo (plant-based face masks)Bonsu’s beauty range has been three years in the making. “I’d been beauty blogging for a while and readers would always ask me if I sold products,” she says. “I took a while creating different blends – all plant-based and handmade,” she says. After launching this summer, Bonsu wants to use eBay’s help on her marketing strategy. “I’d love to get to the stage where Eden \u0026amp Jo is a really trusted brand.”Mentor Ade HassanHellen Stirling-Baker – Small Stuff UK (ethical wooden toys)Stirling-Baker has big plans for Small Stuff. Having started out selling handmade clothes, she now plans to launch wooden toys with a meaningful legacy. “The wood is from a sustainable forest in Scotland. Each toy comes with a certificate of origin.” After taking time out due to postnatal depression, she is looking forward to getting her new toys on eBay. “I want to create products that make people say: ‘I love the ethos behind that brand.’ And it’d be great to hear my little boy say: ‘My Mum did that.’”Mentors Adam and Sinead MurphyCatalina Hoyos Loarer and Ildut Loarer – Pap Yay (paper puzzle block toy)A play on “papier”, Pap Yay was born out of a shared love of design and a desire to find an alternative to the plastic tat touted to new parents. “We wanted to create a beautiful product parents didn’t have to hide,” France-born Loarer explains. “That also leaves space for the imagination, challenging children of different ages.” Boosting their savings with a Kickstarter campaign, the couple currently work out of their Hackney flat. They look forward to seeing how the doers scheme will help them manage big orders. “It’s been an amazing experience so far,” says Loarer. Mentors Adam and Sinead Murphy.Catherine Riney – Our World Travel Logs (printed travel logs and notebooks)After 20 years in business management, Riney decided to act on her idea last year. “I’ve lived in three different countries and I do feel like a citizen of the world,” she says. Aimed at helping travellers engage with their journeys and destinations, Riney hopes her sustainable travel logs will help people think about their impact on the world. “I’m starting a campaign #WeHaveNoticed about positive things people have done around sustainability. I believe everyone can make a difference, however small.”Mentor Cathy McCartyColin Sinclair – Snail Offence (snail-repelling copper fences)“We tried everything, from radiator brush bristles to cat fur,” says Sinclair of his quest to stop slugs and snails decimating his plants, without killing them. “They’re like little ninjas.” After trialling several prototypes, including a windmill that lifted the culprits away, Sinclair came up with the copper fence – an attractive, ingenious alternative. He hopes the scheme can help them reach a wider audience. “Now it’s about building the brand.” Mentor Cathy McCartyAmy Paris and Laura Carr – The London Sleep Company (sleep cosmetics and journal)Working in a high-pressured law firm, Paris struggled with her sleep, and would concoct cosmetic blends to help. Testing them out on colleagues, The London Sleep Company was born. Two years of research later, Paris and her fiancee Carr are ready to launch a range. When it comes to a five-year plan, the pair are dreaming big. “We want to be a one-stop sleep shop,” says Paris. “We’d like to add bed linen, and be sold in any sector where sleep is important. To have a mentor’s input to help us will be invaluable.”Mentors Clare Haines and Melissa BurtonMichele Duplessis and Shannon Teague – Pop ’n Sprinkle (sprinkle-on popcorn flavours)The motivation for Duplessis’ and Teague’s business is simple: “We’re obsessed with popcorn.” Moving to London from South Africa, the friends were confused to find just two flavours on offer at the cinema. “In South Africa, you have at least five sprinkle-on flavours,” says Duplessis. Spotting an opportunity, they worked with a manufacturer to develop six flavours, which they’ve been selling online. The next challenge is to build brand awareness and take Pop ’n Sprinkle into the retail market.Mentors Claire Haines and Melissa BurtonEd Spurr – Acorn vases (green gifts)Allowing customers to grow elegant living oak trees from acorns at home, art dealer Spurr’s self-designed glass vases stem from a combined love of beautiful things and nature. First conceived as gifts for his artists, Spurr feels the vases will have wide appeal. “They’ll be interesting to design enthusiasts, tree lovers, botanists, horticulturists and also families with children,” he says. “I think it’s wonderful that from this piece of wood you can grow a tree that’ll become 500 years old.” With the support of eBay he wants to spread his message worldwide. “I’d love people to use social media to share the beautiful trees they’ve grown and start a conversation, one country to another.”Mentor Joanna DaiCatherine White – Sweet Chestnut Designs (Celtic‑inspired head jewellery)After working in the City and a stint as a truck driver, White longed for a more creative job. Studying silversmithing at Glasgow School of Art, she’d already had success selling “sparkly tiaras” but wanted to try something new. She came up with a Celtic bridal circlet, which a friend convinced her to put on eBay. “It sold straightaway,” says White. “That was 2012, and they haven’t stopped selling.” White is now looking for support with packaging and shipping. “I’d like to expand more into America,” she says.Mentor Joanna DaiLindsey Fairbairn – Ledro Design (inidually designed decals)Teaching assistant Fairbairn started her wall sticker business from her home in Chichester. “I was looking for something creative,” she says. “My degree is in design, and I love to craft things, so I came naturally to the idea.” Often personalised, her vinyl illustrations were an instant hit online. She hopes the scheme will help her find the support to scale the business. “I want to employ someone to manage the customer side of it, so I can concentrate on creating more products that’s where my passion lies.”Mentor Gabi CoxLuke Damian-Grint – Bone Shades (Bone-conducting smart sunglasses)Damian-Grint’s innovative glasses use Bluetooth technology to link your phone to a bone-conducting speaker, so users can take calls and use voice-command via vibrations through their skulls to the inner ear. Some similar products are sold in the US, but Bone Shades are unusual in that they run on Google systems, so the tech is always updating. Damian-Grint has started taking pre-orders and, with the scheme’s support, he eventually wants to expand into other products. “I’d like to build it into a technology fashion brand sold in major retailers globally.”Mentor Walter GleesonEmma Orr – Ambassadors of Science (slime kits and science experiments)Looking for a new way to engage her students, Orr decided to shake up her lessons. “I started running science workshops,” she says, “and created a slime kit.” These proved so popular she took the kits online, developing equipment for basic science experiments. Now, Orr has given up her teaching job to pursue her passion full-time. “All my time is spent on this,” she says. Orr hopes the scheme will help her expand as she develops a Halloween box and preps for the Christmas slime rush.Mentor Walter GleesonSimon Basil – Built by Basil (artisan gear knobs from recycled skateboards)Car gear knobs made from old skateboards might not sound like an obvious idea, but it’s certainly a popular one. A fan of Reddit, Basil shared a video of himself making the accessory on the site and, to his shock, it gained more than 400,000 views in a matter of hours. The orders soon started rolling in. “I sell to people who like customising their cars, which is a massive market,” says the former engineer from Lymington, but he’d love some support. “You can’t beat speaking to someone face to face and fleshing out a problem.”Mentors Mo Bro’sDavid Long – Babouche Golf (handmade personalised golf head covers)A trip to Marrakech inspired Long to create his range of golfing accessories. After commissioning a leather maker in the souks to produce a cover for him, he brought it back to his home course. “Everyone loved that it was nothing like the branded covers on the market,” he says. He now stocks 22 styles and sees eBay as the ideal platform for scaling up. “The scheme has given me the impetus to give this everything, because it’s not a side hustle, it’s my future.”Mentors Mo Bro’sEach of our Doers has been paired with an expert entrepreneur to offer advice and guide them through the scheme.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

They are not even watertight on home territory these days, always offering opponents a hint of reward. Yet, for all Maurizio Sarri’s public utterances to the contrary, they are a side refusing to believe this is merely a two-team title race.This was an impressive victory not least because Chelsea were challenged for periods, and even pegged back to parity, but they never panicked. It helped they could send on Eden Hazard from the bench in the aftermath of Crystal Palace’s equaliser to provide an assist within 91 seconds of his introduction, but their dominance through the last half-hour was total. Álvaro Morata would have finished with a hat-trick had he not taken the bold decision to attempt to chip Wayne Hennessey, at 6ft 6in, from point-blank range in stoppage time. The goalkeeper plucked that effort from the sky, but the damage had long since been inflicted.Sarri equalled a Premier League record here by extending his unbeaten start in the ision to 11 matches, and it is the Italian’s team who are sandwiched between the more fancied contenders at present. It is already hard to believe that Chelsea finished 30 points behind City last time round.“At the beginning, we knew very well that there was a gap,” said the head coach. “So, at the moment, we need only to try to recover the large part of this gap. I hope to recover almost all the gap, but I don’t know … It’s very difficult to recover 30 points in six months, but we are trying.”Those efforts have been impressive to date. It is of benefit that Morata’s confidence is returning, for all the late miss as he and two team-mates tore at Patrick van Aanholt, alone in Palace territory, after the visitors’ corner was cleared. The Spaniard’s spell in English football has largely been underwhelming, a flurry of early goals aside. But the last six games have yielded five to suggest a revival. There was class to his collection and conversion on the turn just after the half-hour mark after Pedro, so often the injection of energy this team requires, had twice fizzed crosses into the centre. When Hazard’s second-half free-kick veered across the penalty area with Palace unable to muster a touch, the 26-year-old was alone at the far post to guide a low shot across Hennessey and into the far corner.“He’s a little bit fragile, from the mental point of view,” said Sarri of Morata, once a club record £57m signing from Real Madrid. “But he’s very young and has great potential. He can improve very fast. Álvaro already improved the last month: improved for the confidence, improved for the personality, improved also from the technical point of view.Nothing summed that up better than Chelsea’s third, courtesy of Marcos Alonso’s trademark burst down the left and low centre which Pedro finished on the charge from around the penalty spot. Palace, competitive for an hour, were helpless to stifle such dynamism.The last 20 minutes were played out with the home side’s work long since done, and thoughts already drifting to Bate Borisov in midweek – where many of this side can expect a breather – and Everton on Sunday.Palace have more wounds to lick ahead of a collision with Tottenham on Saturday, with this an occasion to sum up their season to date. Theirs had been the brighter start, when Max Meyer and Wilfried Zaha were wriggling peskily through Chelsea’s defence, only for a lack of a natural goalscorer in their ranks to leave them blunt. They had steeled themselves at the break, “to be more in their faces”, according to Andros Townsend, and duly conjured a riposte from nothing. James Tomkins’ slide-rule pass found the winger, who exchanged passes with James McArthur and, gliding past David Luiz, crunched a low shot beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga to register a first goal in 20 Premier League games.Regardless, Hazard’s introduction would send a ripple of apprehension through Palace’s ranks, and they were overwhelmed in what time remained. They have not won in six top-flight games, stretching back to mid-September, and visit Manchester United after the match against Spurs. “But it doesn’t really matter where you are at Christmas,” said Roy Hodgson. “We were rarely outside the relegation zone last season but ended up 11th, and only outside the top half on goal difference.“We’ve missed chances, yes, and been a bit unlucky, yes. We don’t have as many points as we should have, yes. But let’s see where we are after 38 games. It’s important to keep going irrespective of what happens in the next few games.” How he must crave a goalscorer such as Morata to ease them clear of danger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3b4c093ead3f83eda1bb6a8a4263e6fd9c58b31/214_449_1679_1007/master/1679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a910c0c09a629b4cd7cb72d3405390df","title":"manchester city southampton premier league match report","story":"This dismantling of Southampton illustrates how difficult dethroning Manchester City will surely be. From opening whistle to the last Pep Guardiola’s side made the contest a duck shoot on an afternoon when Raheem Sterling was sublime.The forward scored twice and helped create three more, and at 23 is only going to improve. So, too, a City whose prevailing characteristic is the embodiment of their manager’s relentlessness. Guardiola’s assessment underlined this, agreeing that most opponents should be frightened of City – but only regarding their opening.City pinned their opponents back instantly from the kick-off. A moment of mild panic from Saints in the area was followed a few moments later by a free-kick. It was hit in from the right by David Silva and though it came to nothing the terms between the sides were about to change.It took six minutes and already cast the contest as a mismatch of Anthony Joshua versus junior-flyweight proportions. Leroy Sané was Guardiola’s sole change from the XI that won at Wembley against Tottenham in their last league outing and promptly showed why he was back.After James Ward-Prowse stepped on the ball Sergio Agüero fed Silva and his pass slid Sané in along the left. In a flash the ball was whipped in and a hapless Wesley Hoedt smashed home for an own goal.Mark Hughes’s men were still reeling when the champions doubled their lead. This time Sterling was provider. The winger appeared to have overrun the ball but managed to turn it across goal and there was Agüero to notch a 150th Premier League goal.The 30-year-old has achieved this in 217 appearances, second only to Alan Shearer’s 212, and had time to miss a golden chance for a second – he hit Alex McCarthy’s legs – before City went 3-0 ahead. Sterling and Sané were again to the fore: the former chipped towards the German and when the ball bounced Silva volleyed it in.City did not face a threat until the 26th minute and it proved an augury of Danny Ings’s penalty strike moments later. When Shane Long crossed, the visiting No 9 was unmarked but could not capitalise.He was about to do better. Ings raced on to a Ryan Bertrand pass along the left and John Stones might have whacked the ball clear. Instead, perhaps due to an Ederson call, he left it to the goalkeeper and as Ings ran on he was pulled down by the Brazilian. The referee, Lee Mason, pointed to the spot and Ings converted for City to concede only a fourth goal in the league, and a first since Newcastle United scored here on 1 September.As half-time approached the home side offered a telling sequence. This was a mesmerising display of passing that took place in the tightest of spaces inside Southampton’s area. Sterling to Sané to Sterling to Sané. He now fed Agüero who nutmegged Hoedt and found Silva. He in turn found Sané who relayed the ball to Kyle Walker who finally took aim, but to no avail.Now, though, came further hurt for the visitors. Agüero picked Cédric Soares’s pocket and turned the ball in from the left. It came to Sterling and his miscontrol worked to his advantage as he gained space and time to collect a fifth of his league campaign.In the second half Guardiola switched Sterling and Sané to the opposite flanks and just after the hour reward nearly came. Agüero fed Sané on the right and the German had a shot that crashed back off McCarthy’s right-hand post. Sterling’s afternoon to remember became even better on 67 minutes when he beat McCarthy for a second time.By the close Sané had made it 6-1 – courtesy of Sterling’s final assist – and City had signalled that they may be even better than last season’s record-breaking champions. It left Hughes frustrated. “We weren’t strong enough in the opening period,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3160a057cbaf777198f714dc16c9b439dbb27bf9/489_110_1696_1017/master/1696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69c42484351e48ec9c583081b0b93ce5","title":"wayne rooney return england squad friendly usa","story":"Wayne Rooney will return to the England squad for next week’s friendly fixture against the USA, with the Football Association to honour the national team’s highest goalscorer for his efforts over his lengthy career.Gareth Southgate has taken the surprise decision to recall Rooney, who retired from international football last year, for the game at Wembley on 15 November. The 33-year-old is likely to start among the substitutes but the intention is to bring him on to earn his 120th cap and seek to add to his record 53-goal haul. The DC United forward said that it would be a “particularly special moment” and that he hopes to pass on some of his experience to the squad.The game has been earmarked to raise funds for the Wayne Rooney Foundation, which is seeking to generate over £500,000 for various children’s charities including the NSPCC. Yet the move still risks accusations of the FA devaluing the fixture, which comes three days before England’s potentially decisive Nations League tie with Croatia at the same venue. Southgate’s team could still aspire to top the three-team group depending upon the result of the Croatians’ game with Spain in Zagreb on the same night as England’s friendly against the US.The governing body and national manager consider these to be unique circumstances, and potentially a once-in-a-generation occasion. They will compare it to the send-off Germany granted to Lukas Podolski, against England in Dortmund last year, when he bowed out after 130 caps. Or, indeed, the celebration the Netherlands offered Wesley Sneijder on the occasion of his 134th and final cap against Peru in September.Neither of those players had been off the scene at this level as long as Rooney, who announced his retirement in August 2017 after turning down the chance to be involved in the squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. Yet the FA has wanted to acknowledge Rooney’s achievements with the national side, particularly given the rather abrupt nature of his retirement from the team.Southgate, who announces his squad on Thursday, will hope the former Everton and Manchester United striker’s presence at St George’s Park in the buildup to the USA fixture will prove a good influence on the set-up’s younger players, with the likes of Jadon Sancho, Mason Mount and James Maddison having been included in the squad which featured in Croatia and Spain last month.“The connection between the FA and former England players is something that has always been very important to me,” said Southgate. “This tribute to Wayne is a unique opportunity that is befitting of our nation’s record goalscorer. We’re fortunate that circumstances have allowed us to formally acknowledge Wayne’s immense contribution to England in front of the Wembley crowd and against apt opponents given the recent impact he has made in MLS.”Rooney’s career with England ned almost 14 years and included spells under six managers, making his debut in February 2003, and he captained the side in 23 of his 119 caps. He has been in prolific form since moving to Major League Soccer in the summer, scoring 12 goals in 18 starts for DC United to propel them from the foot of the table to the end of season play-offs. However, his saved penalty in the play-off against Columbus Crew meant his side were defeated in the first round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c91b4c1b49128f5491056c0a743f4f2c0ebcf1c/0_34_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ccde292608d11454f4505dc408fe8d","title":"chelsea v crystal palace premier league live","story":"Álvaro Morata struck twice as Maurizio Sarri’s Chelsea extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches with victory at Stamford Bridge• Morata double sweeps aside Palace as Chelsea soar to secondRead Dominic Fifield’s match report from Stamford Bridge:Maurizio Sarri’s side extend their unbeaten run to 11 matches, with Álvaro Morata striking either side of Andros Townsend’s equaliser before Pedro sealed victory. That result hoists Chelsea to second in the table, behind leaders Manchester City. Palace remain 14th, three points above the relegation zone.90+3 min: Chelsea break up the other end, with Morata bearing down one-on-one with Hennessey. He attempts to lob the Palace goalkeeper but he does not scoop the ball up out of reach of the Welshman. The hat-trick will elude him.90+2 min: Townsend rampages forward after a little Chelsea sloppiness, but his effort is deflected wide by Azpilicueta.90 min: Zaha tries to weave his way through the Chelsea defence, but David Luiz eventually blocks off passage towards Kepa. There will be three added minutes.89 min: David Luiz, Rudiger and Kovacic are knocking the ball about between themselves. They know the game is won.88 min: Pedro plays a cunning ball in for Morata, but Milivojevic, the Palace captain, slides in to nick the ball away from the feet of the Spaniard, who was dreaming of a hat-trick with only Wayne Hennessey to beat.85 min: Milivojevic is booked by Michael Oliver for crunching through the back of the legs of Fabregas. The Serbian’s tired sigh speaks volumes. Chelsea are heading for second in the table.84 min: Palace win a free-kick just inside the Chelsea half. A lifeline, if you will. But they lump it long and Chelsea repel the ball. Palace have lacked the guile in the final third, barring the odd glimpse of quality by Zaha or Townsend.82 min: Townsend darts infield and fizzes in a through ball for Ayew, but the Palace substitute fails to connect. That was a spark, a ray of light for Palace but they fail to capitalise. That’s been the difference, with Chelsea ruthless and classy when it’s mattered.80 min: Sarri withdraws Jorginho, with Cesc Fabregas his replacement. For Palace, Jeffrey Schlupp replaces James McArthur, who has had a decent game. Palace have not done an awful lot wrong, but Chelsea had Hazard up their sleeve and have punished them when the chances presented themselves.78 min: Kovacic does well to stand his ground before attempting to slide in Morata, but Sakho does well to snuff the ball out. It would be wrong to say that Hazard has been the difference, but the Chelsea substitutes have provided a real fillip for the hosts. They have certainly been smarter in possession.76 min: Rudiger reads Wan-Bissaka’s cross and heads clear. Palace pile forward once more but Van Aanholt’s right-footed effort flies high and wide. Chelsea are in cruise control, really.74 min: Wan-Bissaka wins a throw-in for Palace midway inside the Chelsea half, and that’s about as good as things have got for Roy Hodgson’s side since finding that equaliser. Can they find a way back into the game? It is not rocket science that Zaha is the catalyst for Palace and Chelsea have hounded him out this half.71 min: Jordan Ayew is on for Palace, in place of Max Meyer.It’s three for Chelsea, with Pedro effortlessly guiding home with his right foot after meeting a low Alonso cross from the left. Morata’s second goal really allowed Chelsea to find their stride once more and now they have two-goal cushion.66 min: An immediate introduction by Hazard, then. It was a lovely ball in but Palace just switched off once again at the set-piece. An unmarked Morata peeled off at the back post, and it was another clever, stinging finish. A suckerpunch for Palace. Another superb finish by Alvaro Morata, who strikes his and Chelsea’s second. It is deja vu for Palace, with another simple free-kick flighted in, this time by Hazard, and lurking at the back post is Morata who fires home from an acute angle. For Morata, it is four Premier League goals in as many appearances.63 min: That free-kick is Willian’s last involvement, with Eden Hazard summoned. Mateo Kovacic is also on for Chelsea in place of Barkley, who has been pretty ineffective in this second half.62 min: David Luiz’s header is kept out by Wayne Hennessey! Willian dinks an inviting ball into the box from 30 yards out and the Brazilian’s header forces the Palace goalkeeper into a fairly comfortable, but nevertheless essential stop. A double change is imminent for Chelsea.60 min: With both teams electric on the counter, this game has become quite end-to-end, especially since Townsend’s equaliser. Zaha does superbly to dance inside the Chelsea box before Meyer attempts to swing the ball beyond Kepa. Chelsea seem a little panicked, having surrendered a little composure.58 min: Wan-Bissaka again does well to keep Willian at bay, stemming the winger’s run down the left. Frustrated, the Brazilian cuts inside and bends an effort towards goal but Hennessey watches it all the way.57 min: Azpilicueta whips in a ball from the right and Morata meets it, but his header is palmed away by Wayne Hennessey. The linesman had his flag raised anyway, with Morata having strayed a yard in front of Mamadou Sakho. How will Chelsea respond? Well, Eden Hazard is being readied in the dugout.54 min: Chelsea had started this second half a little sluggishly, almost a bit blase. Palace had to lap up a bit of pressure, but then ably pounced, incisively breaking Chelsea’s stubborn defence. A brilliant finish by Andros Townsend, and a beautiful pass by James McArthur. The Palace forward plays a neat give-and-go with McArthur, who slides him in behind the Chelsea back line. He races beyond David Luiz and slams the ball into the corner of Kepa’s goal. Just like that, Palace pull level.51 min: Alonso and Willian double up down the left as Chelsea go in search of a second, but Palace turn over possession just as the momentum builds.49 min: Eden Hazard soaks up the applause after trudging along the touchline to warm up. Palace supporters are not quite so pleased to see him. Maurizio Sarri suggested earlier that he would only play if needed. 48 min: Alonso plays a speculative ball forward but it is almost spectacular as Pedro brings the ball back down from the sky. It breaks down, but Kante then shifts the ball out back out wide to Pedro, who tries and fails to pick out Morata. Palace themselves look to build, with Jorginho clattering Zaha. 47 min: Van Aanholt raids down the left, winning an early second-half throw-in after Rudiger hooks the ball clear. Then Pedro hacks clear another ball in. Palace have started brightly and positively, just as they did the first 45 minutes. Manchester City have whooped Southampton 6-1:A smart finish by Alvaro Morata is the difference at the interval, while Willian had a second goal ruled out for offside. Chelsea did not look back after taking the lead, but that goal knocked the stuffing out of Palace, who have looked predictably reliant on Zaha producing a bit of magic on the counterattack.45 min: Zaha fouls Rudiger on halfway, as the fourth official indicates one added minute. Palace could do with getting down the tunnel after what was an impressive start by Roy Hodgson’s side.43 min: Alonso nicks the ball off Zaha, before Barkley takes over the baton as Chelsea look to break having turned over possession. They fly forward, but Morata puts a foot wrong, failing to control the ball and instead it bumbles out for a Palace throw-in. Maurizio Sarri, meanwhile, is a picture of calm.42 min: Chelsea look very comfortable, with Barkley growing into the game. He has impressed, as has Willian, who has just had his cross cut out by Aaron Wan-Bissaka, the Crystal Palace full-back.39 min: Another neat move and another clever bit of play by Morata. The goalscorer plays a nice one-two in the area but Scott Dann sniffs out the cross. 38 min: Willian flights in the ball, for Alonso to nod across goal at the back post. There is Morata just outside the six-yard box, but he cannot fuel enough power on his header to trouble Hennessey in the Palace goal. This is relatively plain-sailing for Chelsea now. That steady start feels a long time ago now.37 min: A quick stat, courtesy of Opta, as Willian whizzes in another free-kick: Alvaro Morata has scored in back-to-back games in the Premier League for the first time since November 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/569e28b1c078a04388f4cc2d6018633b6661c81e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461ebe8a399b01d2b8be6687baab68d9","title":"setting sail one womans year alone at sea","story":" Susan Smillie quit her job to search by sea for a kinder Britain. A year on, she’s still afloat. Illustration by Owen GildersleeveIt is black in the Bay of Biscay, just stars above, and below, the canyons. We’re but a crumb out here, floating beyond the continental shelf where it drops from 300m to near 5,000m. Deeper than I can imagine, this wine-dark sea, no one in sight, or radio range. And silent, but for the waves rushing against my little boat, Isean. Stars shoot overhead, but they’ll have to try harder for my attention. I’m staring down, where dolphins are magically lit by phosphorescence. One wonderful creature spins beside me, a trail of stars in its wake. I’m in a trance, my arm trailing the water. The sails luff, I’ve gone off course and look skywards for the Plough – I’m using stars, rather than compass for my bearings. Later, I will somehow fall asleep while dolphins breach by my window.I can hardly believe I’m here, headed for Spain on my own boat. I wasn’t even expecting to cross the Channel. I’d quit my job to sail around Britain, an idea that took hold the previous summer, sailing in Devon and Cornwall. It wasn’t just the beauty of the coastline, the gentle pace – collecting mussels, swimming with seals – it was the unique perspective. Sailing alone into harbours seeking shelter, I was invited in, not local nor tourist, but part of an ancient seafaring tradition. I found myself at home chatting with Brixham trawlermen, watching old people in Fowey swing dancing to Erasure.It sharply contrasted with my life in London. I’d been ridiculously happy there, living on my (bigger) boat on the Thames, had the only job I’d ever wanted, a features editor for the . But I had a growing disquiet – I felt weirdly disconnected from the wider world. Brexit reinforced that. I was depressed by the result, but also by an ugly narrative espoused even by tolerant friends, that Leave voters were racist or stupid. I would go in search of a kinder Britain, I told myself, find some hope to write about. It was more selfish than that. I wanted an escape and my exit was clearly marked – to sea. By August I’d made Land’s End. Stuck in bad weather, autumn drawing close, sailing north into winter lost its appeal. Heading south, on the other hand, well, that was too exciting for words, and experienced friends assured me it would actually be easier, the trade winds blowing Isean and me down the Atlantic coast, the weather improving the farther we went.It sounded sensible but intimidating. I had a basic qualification – a day skipper’s licence – but didn’t consider myself experienced. Still, I’d learn along the way, and find crew for longer passages. I would turn left at Land’s End instead of right, leave Brexit Britain behind. If I made Brittany, I’d be happy with that as a winter adventure. A thousand miles later, I blew into Portugal. A year on, I’m in Italy, and still haven’t come home.I’d worried about being lonely in France. I needn’t have. Brittany is the epicentre of sailing and everyone was interested in my journey. “You are taking on the nose of Brittany!?! By yourself? In this leetle boat?” This reaction became common, so rare are solo female sailors. I laughed when someone in Portugal introduced themselves, “I heard about you in Spain” – and when a harbour-master gestured to the cabin, nodding, “Do you have a man down there?” A year on, I’m more jaded by my apparent novelty factor – men staring, taking photographs – behold the woman, lifting her anchor! – I usually wave, to reduce the awkwardness (for myself it doesn’t seem to bother them). Sometimes, it goes beyond awkward – the guy circling, by empty cliffs, his jet ski revving, staring, wordlessly for just too long. It’s a sad fact I’ve felt more threatened on an empty harbour wall, drunk men outside, than by dangers faced at sea. But why dwell on that? I’ve had so much respect along the way (and size does matter – I love when sailors emerge from enormous yachts, all thumbs-up in recognition of the challenge of sailing a small boat – Isean is under 8m). And I’ve had untold support – there’s this international community of self-sufficient problem-solvers on the water, almost always ready to help – because everyone knows what it’s like to be in trouble at sea.I’m more at home at sea now than anywhere. I realised how much my perspective had changed when I posted a picture online, happily anchored on some idyllic empty spot, to find my dad worried about how lonely it looked. Poor Sam. I must be a nightmare. He was in the merchant navy and understands something of the challenges I face. My first, after the Channel crossing (24 undramatic hours, give or take a few ships), came fast: the Chenal du Four, where strong currents run for 30 miles to the notorious passage of Raz de Sein. Nearing the entrance, my engine quit. Not ideal, I thought, but I’ll sail. Then the wind dropped. Then the fog came. After three attempts at clearing the air lock, I got my engine going and made it through.Fog became a theme. After crossing Biscay, came the aptly named Costa da Morte. A friend, Cat, joined me for her first ever sail. She was a natural, luckily – five hours of fog accompanied us down the coast of death. What started atmospheric turned eerie, then miserable. We hugged the shoreline avoiding ships, foghorn at the ready, the radio transmitting calls for a boat that disappeared here the night before. Gradually, the fog thinned, until we could look back on the thick white halo blanketing Finisterre – beautiful, from a safe distance. By the time we reached the Galician islands, it was mist, making our first glimpse of this stunning archipelago fleeting and magical. “Look how beautiful it probably is,” called Cat, optimistically, as the Cíes islands showed themselves for seconds.Other moments stand out on the journey south – dawn departures, the last of the stars and fishing boats finding warmth (Lisbon in October), jumping in heart-bursting joy to tunes on golden sunset sails. But it was hard work. Those trade winds didn’t materialise to push me south. I’d set off late – mid-September – and raced into wind to beat coming storms. I spent winter in the glorious little town of Olhão in the Algarve, learned enough Portuguese to chat to fishermen about the weather, made friends, thought of it as home. I started to notice how tiny my living space was. Isean’s very basic – a toilet, a tiny galley with a sink, a burner and (rubbish) grill. A table to eat at, berths to sleep on. My spontaneous departure meant it wasn’t set up for long-term cruising. Unlike everyone I met, I didn’t even have a fridge (French friends had a sous-vide on board. Of course they did.) The Portuguese winter was mild, but a damp month on anchor convinced me I needed heating. A friend installed a mini woodburner – life changing. Anyway, I could do without basic comforts – I had no business languishing in harbours. Isean is happiest on the move, and so am I. I left in April, for the Mediterranean.The air is heavy with the scent of petrol. I’ve drifted within a few feet of a small boat pitching in a heavy swell. It’s dark, about 3am, I can make out several of 10 men on board they’ve been at sea for five days, 100 miles from Algeria to here, within 40 miles of the Spanish coast. Some are lying down, sick, others leaning over and, I realise with alarm, smoking – in this boat awash with fuel. It’s a grim scene, but I’d expected worse. I’d raced five miles here after friends on Wilma, a Swedish boat I’m crossing to the Balearics with, issued a mayday. The men had pursued them, panicked and screaming, and in desperation crashed into Wilma’s hull, one of them jumping aboard.Over the radio, it sounded terrifying. My friend Tjoppe’s “man overboard”, the fastest way to summon rescue, is short on detail, so it was unclear who was in the water – his wife Helena? – or how they’d got there. I imagined the worst. As I changed course towards them, I was shaking so much I could barely turn my engine key. It transpired that two of the men had fallen in trying to board Wilma, and were recovered unhurt. Wilma, undamaged, circled the dinghy protectively. Fear turned to relief, then apprehension – it would be four hours before the coastguard came. The men shouted to come aboard (risky in the swell), twice making for me, but their engine failed. It was a long night. I hadn’t slept in 30 hours I couldn’t imagine a week in a dinghy. At dawn, the Spanish coastguard arrived. Tears fell as the men lined up on the boat gunwales and touched hearts in farewell to Wilma, safe – for now. This summer, the UNHCR estimated that more than 1,800 people died crossing the Mediterranean, a sharp rise in proportion to numbers setting out, and an indication of the greater risks taken. Italy’s far-Right interior minister Matteo Salvini has said the coastguard should ignore distress calls from migrant boats, a view that’s taking hold across Europe, with humanitarian efforts being criminalised. In June, EU leaders instructed NGO ships to stop rescuing migrants – hours after 100 people drowned off the coast of Libya.The Mediterranean is an unkind sea. Here, the winds, rather than tides, reign supreme. And what monsters: the Levanter, the Meltemi, the Mistral, often heralding their arrival with screeching like a getaway car on a bank heist. I’d arrived with spring’s unsettled weather and, pummelled by steep waves and heavy seas, thought about the Atlantic every day. I didn’t know you could miss an ocean so much. June and July were sunny and calmer, but extreme weather was coming. I wouldn’t get used to storms, but I would learn from them. On my first, I failed to reef (reduce) my sails. The boat heeled dangerously as we powered upwind. I headed out to sea for space and cried.Last month, I was anchored with Cat in Sardinia when monstrous winds rushed in with thunder and sheet lightning illuminating the full filmic horror of it. The bay, calm moments before, unrecognisable, white foam and torrential rain washing sideways, my dinghy (since named Kite) flying overhead like the house in the Wizard of Oz. A far larger boat, pushed to land, almost hit us in its struggle to get offshore. I worked at Isean’s anchor, letting out chain, so we wouldn’t join them near the rocks. I sent Cat to the cockpit – the rain was so heavy, she needed a scuba mask to see me. It raged for hours. I hardly recognise myself now. I don’t mean looks (although the sun has turned me blonde). I’m surprised at how far I’ve come, the reserves I’ve found – we humans are so much more capable and adaptable than we realise. I’ve never been practical, but I’m learning – and what satisfaction I’ve found in grasping (very) basic mechanics. I have to, because at sea you solve your own problems, and I won’t give this life up, I’ve a Greek odyssey to think about, not to mention the pull towards Africa.I like how this lifestyle has changed me. I’m more careful with resources, taking just what I need – I’m no saint, it’s pragmatic. When you have to seek out water, you don’t waste a drop. When shops are 20 nautical miles away, you improvise – flatbreads on the frying pan, salting fish – you get resourceful. I’m geekily into budgeting, spending around £60 a week (roughly what I shelled out on travel, coffees, lunch at work). I’m happier, healthier and stronger. Yes, there’s stress, but it’s life-affirming. It’s humbling to be at the mercy of the elements, to focus on what matters. Am I safe? Where can I get shelter, water, food? There’s nothing I miss, other than regular showers (daily swims and washing from a basin doesn’t do much for your hair) – but I like my deep appreciation of simple pleasures – who knew there was so much joy in a hot shower and fresh laundry?And for every challenge, there are many more unforgettable moments. Sailing towards Africa’s mighty Jebel Musa – the Pillars of Hercules, marking the continents of Africa and Europe. There was the morning I was joined by a pod of pilot whales, and swordfish, a silver vision of pure muscle surging out of the sea. And watching the red moon rise from a quiet bay, or sleeping al fresco under a meteor shower. My back garden is gin-clear water – pipefish and turtles my nosy neighbours. My fiery orange sunsets are unobstructed, my starry skies unpolluted by light. Every single day, I feel lucky to call this wild, unbiddable, impossibly beautiful sea my home.

Simon Garfield (see above for a scale model) explains the allure of little thingsAt the end of last year I made myself eight inches tall. I had seen the movie Downsizing, in which Matt Damon shrinks himself into a place called Leisureland, and I’d thought, “How hard can that be?”It turns out, not hard at all. I paid £199 to be photographed in a small white bell tent at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, and was told to stand on a round white disk and keep perfectly still. As I froze the white disk began to rotate slowly, and a bank of 14 cameras on a pole took about 400 photographs of me from top to toe. The whole thing lasted less than a minute, and when it was over I watched the layered images rendering on a display screen at the back of the tent. Once the photos had combined to reformat me back into a whole person, the 3D image was sent to a 3D printer, and within a few weeks I was made into a sandstone composite.The first sight wasn’t unnerving, as I had expected, but reassuring: it was a good likeness. Receiving my model was a little like unboxing an Action Man, although I couldn’t bend its arms or legs, and I wasn’t quite so ripped. The reaction from those who saw it unprepared was different: they were astonished. There was surprise that such a thing was possible, and admiration for the detail. They commented on the accuracy of my hair, and the creases in my jacket and jeans. And almost everyone wanted one of themselves or their family or their pets.This is the miniature’s moment. Jessie Burton’s much-loved novel, The Miniaturist, was a bestseller and a recent BBC adaptation. In March 2017, the most notable sale at the European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht was a Dutch doll’s house containing 200 17th-century silver ornaments (the asking price was €1.75m). Four months later, a miniature portrait of George IV by Richard Cosway sold at Christie’s for £341,000, many times the previous record for the artist. Earlier this year, a 19th-century French porcelain doll sold in Maryland for $333,500, a world record for a doll at auction.What can possibly be the appeal? The answer lies in our desire for mastery and elucidation. The ability to enhance a life by bringing scaled-down order and illumination to an otherwise chaotic world – a world over which we may otherwise feel we have little control – cannot be overvalued. The fascination of holding in our hands something completely realised at an impossibly reduced scale is a wholly fulfilling one, and the satisfactions of inquisitive observation will never tire. At its simplest, the miniature shows us how to see, learn and appreciate more with less.I’ve written a book about the role of the miniature in our lives, and I’m not sure I’ve ever tackled a subject as big. The miniature world embraces control. The toys we enjoy as children invest us with a rare power at a young age, conferring the potency of adults, and possibly giants. Toy cars and dolls and plastic construction kits are not merely pliable in our hands they render us conquerors. We may never have such dominion over the world again, unless we continue the play into adulthood.As adults, we bring things down to size to understand and appreciate them. Something too big to visualise at full scale – a building perhaps, or a war – may be rendered comprehensible at 12:1. Artists, sculptors, set designers and poets all work in miniature because it encourages greater scrutiny and deeper participation. Miniature items help us imagine grander schemes. A signal box on a model railway is eyed with needling precision, and with the care we would seldom apportion to one at full size. Architects of future cities must first scheme in model form, and the model may be the only proof that they attempted such a thing.We would struggle to educate ourselves without the miniature. Models have been part of the intellectual architecture of museums for more than 200 years, and it is often the spatial encounter with these objects that make a child’s first encounter with a museum memorable. The satisfaction of observing small things becomes a desire to make small things, and both stages address the human need for comprehension and order. We live in a huge and doomy universe, and controlling just a tiny scaled-down part of it restores our sense of order and worth. We may not play in the World Cup or the Ryder Cup, but there is always table football and crazy golf. What is a drone if not a modern remote-controlled model aeroplane? And what is a globe if not everything we understand about the lay of the land?I think we may also struggle to educate ourselves without the amateur. The world advances on enthusiasms and ingenuity from the shed and the garage (the steam engine, the personal computer), and until their work is appreciated and valued they know only private passion and familial disapproval. But the miniature aspires to art: at its best, it may offer up the illuminating and profound. At the very least, it may expand our perception of the things the mind only thinks it knows.Soon after I began examining the scaled-down world I found I had fallen down a rabbit hole so infinite that I feared I might never crawl out of it. I once regarded with suspicion the sign on the door of the doll’s house emporium near my home that says: “This is not a toy shop.” For what else could it be? When I entered I found tiny tennis racquets with real stringing, and jars of Marmite so small that even a mouse wouldn’t be satisfied come teatime. The shop performed that familiar miniature trick: it had indelible belief in its own existence. And because everything was miniature, nothing looked small. I left the shop believing that the cars outside were juggernauts, and the pillar box was the size of the Guggenheim.Worlds within worlds existed long before those suggested by Lewis Carroll or quantum physics. The history of the miniature stretches back to the ancients, and its path tracks an irreducible line. Lucretius had it right when he observed, “A small thing may give an analogy of great things, and show the tracks of knowledge,” and the art director George Lois had it right too when he claimed, “The only thing that gets better when it gets bigger is the penis.”I spent time with Egyptian shabtis, the pottery figurines designed to secure a life free of toil in the afterlife. I studied the wooden model of a slave ship that hastened the end of the slave trade in the UK. But almost inevitably I was drawn to the obsessives, those men with their train driver’s caps and their tiny models in sheds and attics, with their wives long gone… And their wives with their own china madnesses, their little toy families, their smooth hedgehog collections, their treasured things in felt. We create small universes in which we may bury ourselves to the exclusion of all else. Blocking out real life for a while – always the prerequisite of the dedicated domestic hobby, from doll’s house modeller to jigsaw enthusiast to adult book colourist – may be contemplative, meditative, blinkered and essential. The people crouching over tiny details as if the world depended on it are only doing it because their world does depend on it.The deep craziness began in the 19th century with the flea circus, in which creatures with names such as The Great Herman were tethered to jeweller’s tiny chariots and appeared to pull them for fun they were actually trying to rid themselves of the harness. The fleas also fought duels (not generally of their own volition for their swords were similarly tethered), and appeared to jump through hoops. So popular were these attractions in London, Hamburg and New York that flea masters vied for the public’s shilling with all manner of hucksterism, including a newspaper story claiming that one star flea – a daredevil on a motorcycle – had deserted his circus with a bout of depression.No less extreme, I enjoyed straining my eyes with the enthusiasts of the Miniature Book Society, a group who will stop at nothing to bring great literature down to size. The members, about 300 worldwide, are primarily concerned with the artistic beauty of volumes of any subject, but will also proudly sell you what was once considered the world’s smallest book, a bound collection of flower illustrations printed in Japan in 2013 at 0.7mm x 0.7mm. But such a feat now appears huge alongside the miniature reading material rendered possible by the digital world, such as the entire opening page of A Tale of Two Cities reduced by Stanford nanotechnologists to fit on the head of a pin.Pins and needles feature a lot among modern miniaturists, not least the microscopic endeavours of Willard Wigan MBE, whose honour has accrued from placing, say, Snow White and Seven Dwarfs or The Last Supper within the eye of a needle, or the astute and emotive work of Slinkachu, who abandons minuscule plastic model-railway figures to their tragic or hilarious fate in the real world (a seemingly huge pro-Trump election badge pierces the heart of a tiny potential voter a man hangs himself on a thin branch of vibrant cherry blossom).And then I wasted a fair bit of time watching someone’s hands make tiny food on YouTube. Here, everything is reduced in scale – the chopping board, the entire mise-en-place array. The spoons look very stupid when held between the tips of two average-sized fingers, but try to sit through, for example, the miniature construction of an egg-burger with carrots and broccoli by YouTube’s Miniature Space and not start salivating. And you won’t be alone: at the time of writing, this video has been watched 1,113,391 times. The internet and social media has validated and monetised all these tiny madnesses: a maker may no longer be dismissed as just a sad or crazy person, they are instructional leaders.At the end of my research – seldom arduous, it should be said – I wondered where my own fascination with miniature objects had begun, and initially I was stumped: growing up, I wasn’t fond of Action Man or Lego, or building things small. But then it dawned. One of the most treasured objects I have from my late parents is a small and fragile sandstone figure with an Ishtar cap and upturned arms made in Cyprus around 700 BC. I’ve been aware of it all my life, but I’ve only recently acknowledged its significance. It’s a fertility figure, 5in tall, and I was conceived only a year or so after my father brought it into our home.Simon Garfield’s In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate the World is published by Canongate at £14.99.

My wife had, sensibly, returned from the holiday a day earlier. In one arm I held my screaming one-year-old daughter, Lyra. Her folded pram was slung over the other shoulder. I was clutching passports and a nappy bag and surrounding me on the floor were my suitcases and an assortment of carrier bags overflowing with food, nappies, books and toys. Lyra went silent, I felt her abdomen tense, her face turned deep crimson and she forced out a long and resonant fart which sounded far more like it came from me than from her. A little area cleared around me in the airport. For some reason, probably fatigue, I put a finger into the nappy gusset to check that it was just a fart. It wasn’t. Now my finger was coated in baby poo and pretty soon so were our passports, luggage, Lyra and me. She was unfed, unwatered, covered in shit, and we were about to miss our flight.In truth, I knew I would be this kind of parent, even if other people had higher hopes. There is a widespread idea that being a doctor must give you a leg up in the parenting game. My wife, a journalist, is often told: “It must be nice to have a doctor as a husband.”There are superficial similarities between being a doctor – especially an infectious diseases doctor like me – and the first year of parenthood. Faeces is the common currency of both tasks. Viruses abound. A friend who is a paediatrician likes to say that, up until the age of five, children are functionally HIV positive. We’ve had stretches of months where coughs, snot and bouts of diarrhoea have taken turns wrecking sleep for everyone while I remain helpless. Doctors, even infection specialists, don’t have a monopoly on treatment of minor infections. We know very little about what causes them and less about how to fix them. I have a PhD in virology but my mother’s ginger-lemon-honey recipe is the staple antiviral in our house.So far there have been exactly two occasions where I felt skilful as a parent because I am a doctor. First, Lyra was born in a heatwave. I kept her hydrated and avoided admission to hospital for IV fluids even though we were struggling with breastfeeding.The second display of skill came when Dinah had an episode of mastitis, a blocked infected milk duct. We used hands, expression pumps and, of course, a baby, to drain the infected breast. The best moments of parenting are inextricably mingled with the worst. All three of us naked in the bath at 2am, covered in rapeseed oil for the boob massage, the water cloudy with milk, and the fever finally subsiding – a high and low point in equal measure.Of course, simply because I felt skilful doesn’t mean that I was skilful. I did nothing that any parent with a decent amount of common sense and the internet couldn’t have managed. But both occasions have something significant in common: I felt skilful because I avoided medical treatment. Of course this isn’t necessarily skilful I might just have been lucky that nothing went wrong.This is important to say because it’s likely that doctors under-treat their children, likely because we ourselves avoid medical treatment. There aren’t masses of data but we know that what doctors want for themselves at the end of life and what we recommend to patients is quite different. We don’t want to be resuscitated or have dialysis or chemotherapy or feeding tubes. We know that in terms of mental health and suicide we are sicker than average, yet we present late for treatment, often only when compelled to by colleagues or the law.It’s not altogether clear why we reject our own methods. One study of medical patients in the BMJ ides clinicians into perfectionists, narcissists, compulsives, denigrators of vulnerability, and martyrs, none of whom are likely to seek care. A few of us combine these personality traits to make someone who would literally die before seeking the opinion of a colleague.With our children, we may be more likely to miss a broken leg or pneumonia than to turn up at A\u0026ampE with a false alarm. I know that because I have two close friends, both excellent doctors, who missed those very diagnoses. It was their non-medical partners who insisted on going to hospital.Even if I have been skilful twice, there have been many more times when I failed Lyra as her physician. Discoid eczema confidently diagnosed as a fungal infection. (Did I mention that I specialise in infectious diseases? When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.) Diarrhoea that I realised one day had been going on for several weeks without any attempt at diagnosis, all the while Lyra losing a dangerous amount of weight. This fact was only discovered by our excellent GP. We had never weighed her.So, the idea that a doctor would be a better parent is bizarre in many ways. Perhaps the expectation that they would be speaks to the extent that we have medicalised childhood. Or maybe we think skills are more transferable than they really are. Do people who are skilled at something else make better parents? Would you expect Garry Kasparov or Tim Peake or Judi Dench to have “better” children? If you’ve ever met the children of doctors you’ll know that they’re no better adjusted, healthier or less injured than the rest of us.But if being a doctor doesn’t seem to have improved my parenting, being a parent does seem to have improved my doctoring.In the early months, the doctor in me approached my daughter as a set of problems to be cleaned, fed, silenced. I thought parenting was a form of work, undertaken to produce a particular outcome. This type of approach has parallels with much of the problem-oriented, metric-driven way that we practise medicine now.But my wife, and in fact most of the people I know, seemed to have a different idea about parenting. I remember asking a friend why he didn’t do more regimented sleep training with his kids, who kept him up. “Because it’s not very nice for them,” he replied. This was a revelation to me.Professor Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist at University of California, Berkeley, uses the analogies of carpentry or gardening to describe different forms of parenting. Carpentry is about the attainment of perfection. Gardening is about creating an environment where life thrives. Now we’re all about gardening.The gardening approach may sound laidback – “I just let her be what she wants to be” – but it still requires a few technical skills. Part of being relaxed is knowing what to obsess about. When I plan, pack carefully, and get the basics of food, water and sleep right we’re all much happier and cleaner.Mainly, I’m lucky that my wife is that rare person who combines being fun with being ferociously well organised, so that check-in scenario doesn’t happen too much these days.I’m almost ashamed to admit the way that being a parent has changed me as a doctor. As I’ve started to see parenting, and Lyra, as things to be enjoyed, I’ve reflected on my approach to a busy clinic or ward round where patients can become units to be processed, problems to be solved.My wife consciously taught me that our daughter is a small human being to be lived with and cared for. When she cries she’s not being manipulative when she craps in an airport queue it is not to annoy me. Nappies aren’t things to be forced on and off as quickly as possible. Hands should be warmed before applying eczema cream.I wasn’t cruel to her but I think I treated her like a patient, trying to solve her problems as efficiently as possible. Many of my patients are unwell and unhappy because of problems I can’t solve: the structural violence of their life and their environment. I can only listen and show that I care. So now I try a little harder to treat my patients, like my daughter, as human beings. I wash my hands frequently with both.Chris van Tulleken appears in Operation Ouch!

I have great friends and a good job. A year ago I met someone through some friends. Nothing happened, we just went out for a few drinks and socialised a bit. But we really hit it off. We had a very similar sense of humour, as well as similar backgrounds. The guy was a bit younger than me, in his late twenties. I found him very attractive and I felt that he liked me too he was very flirty a lot of the time. I think about him a lot. Way too much, probably. He moved away soon after (with his boyfriend) and although we have had a bit of contact (initiated by me) I haven’t heard from him for ages. I just want to know how to get him out of my head. I feel sad that I’ll probably never see him again, although I’m not so stupid as to have ever done anything to ruin my great relationship. But I miss him. We hit it off, had a laugh together, and I feel like there was a connection there. What do you think? How do I get him out of my head? How do I put it in perspective, see it for what it was and move on?Mariella replies Lucky you. What does it feel like? There are plenty among us who would struggle to recall the deliciously unexpected and life-affirming thrill of pure, unadulterated chemistry. The queue of lifers out there (and the prison analogy is intentional) consumed with envy at your good fortune will be a long one. To have enjoyed that delicious frisson, however briefly, with nobody the wiser and without causing harm to those you love, is a blessing of sorts. To paraphrase the anthropologist Helen Fisher, whose Why We Love, Why We Cheat is a TED Talks hit, romantic love is not an emotion, it’s a drive that comes from the craving part of the mind and has a similar impact to cocaine. So struggling to shrug off your addiction is no mean feat.Your encounter is an example of how our lives pivot on fleeting moments. I knew one day I’d have the opportunity to quote my favourite George Michael song and now at last here it is. “Turn a different corner and we never would have met,” he crooned with aching poignancy in a celebration and lament of the transitory nature of fate. But just because an opportunity presents itself doesn’t mean we have to act on it, nor is it compulsory that because our lustful thoughts have been inspired by one person they have to be consummated with the same one! If that were the case, the porn industry would shut down overnight and Hollywood not long after.Enjoying the sensation of desire is a pleasure in itself and not always something we have to chase down and make visceral. So many of the best moments in life are those that remain unrequited, with a question mark forever floating over what might have been. I once danced with a man for the duration of one song and remember it still as one of the sexiest experiences of my entire life. That it never evolved further is probably why it remains so deliciously etched in my memory.In real life we know what comes next: compromise, responsibility and the daily maintenance required to keep any relationship and, later, family afloat. I don’t mean to make it sound workaday there are transcendental moments to be shared even in the longest-term unions. As cold winter draws in, or emotional challenges arise, I’ll warrant I’m not the only coupled-up inidual glad someone has my back. That shudder of pure sexual electricity can be celebrated without being consummated, as valuable a reminder of our sexuality as what we have chosen to sacrifice for the comfort of cohabitation. There is an alternative route where we grasp every opportunity that comes our way, making pleasure our prime consideration with little care for those we damage in its pursuit. Plenty of our species do seem to have decided that life is a free-for-all and each day has to be treated like a looting frenzy, a smash-and-grab through anything you can get your hands on that might please you or add that elusive sense of value to your life. It’s a fin-de-siècle impulse that’s likeliest to proliferate when the world is feeling like an unstable and unfulfilling place to inhabit.The most decadent of dynasties mark their own demise in a descent into self-indulgence on an epically destructive scale – Nero, the court of Versailles, the Borgias. Will Tinder and Grindr prove to be our lyres? Wandering the ruins of ancient civilisations offers the chance to marvel at what they built but also offers a salutary reminder of what was lost. We too will pass and the more we succumb to our basest instincts for gratification the sooner we’ll make ourselves redundant.One of the downsides of locking into a long-term liaison is that no matter what advantages it brings, it rarely continues to offer that magical alchemy that gets you wondering what it would feel like to press skin on skin. Being human often comes down to the tussle between biology and brain, and sexual chemistry is the clearest example. It sounds to me like you’ve got a good life, a great partner and a lot to lose for a rush of pheromones. How’s that for perspective?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67411f8c4d4aedcefb121db4ad824acab786f89a/0_810_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656cd9a4e6bf8464b742e8b2f61b678f","title":"channel 4s move to leeds could turn the tide","story":"The increasing concentration of the media in the capital is a disaster for democracy and ersityIt is in the DNA of most journalists to feel a profound sense of scepticism about new schemes, especially if they started as dodgy ill-thought through political initiatives.

High property prices in London mean that only those who can already afford to live there (often through wealthy or even just local parents) can afford to spend any time at all trying to make it in the national media.Many journalists, young and old, would love the chance of making their careers as well as their homes closer to where they grew up – whether in Glasgow, Bristol or Leeds.

Why should there be more Channel 4 journalists in Washington than any British city outside London?Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, who talked of the failure of the media to venture beyond the capital in his 2017 MacTaggart lecture, was full of praise for the decision. He also has the advantage of having a child at Leeds university. Few senior members of staff are looking for houses in the north.Doubts still remain over cost. Offices in Leeds, Glasgow and Bristol will only work if the channel is committed to develop local talent rather than insist on ferrying its stars between London and Leeds each day.

They suggested that a December deal would mean not only a later parliamentary vote but would require spending on no-deal planning and changes to the roles of hundreds of civil service. There is chance of progress being made in order for an emergency summit to be called on Friday, government insiders believe, suggesting it is possible the cabinet will not be directly involved if it was last-minute. “It is high stakes,” the source said.EU officials and diplomats cautioned against the optimism expressed by some about the imminence of a breakthrough, describing the chances of striking a deal that meets both sides needs as “50-50”.Brussels has so far insisted the withdrawal agreement must contain legal text that could keep Northern Ireland in effect in the customs union and single market as Britain leaves.The commission has accepted that an all-UK customs union could be referenced and prioritised in the agreement, with a separate treaty, negotiated during the transition period, filling out the details.An EU official suggested that such a UK-wide customs deal could only replace the Northern Ireland-specific text if it was a permanent arrangement, and even then there would serious legal issues with making such a commitment at this stage.“There is an evolution in the commission’s thinking. From what they originally proposed, there is a shift towards the UK in terms of the UK-wide thing so, yes, flexible, but whether that flexibility will lead to agreement is something else,” the official said.The source said any hope of Northern Ireland-specific customs arrangements being removed would involve a “huge jump on the UK side”.Even with an all-UK customs deal at the heart of the withdrawal agreement, there would need to be Northern Ireland-specific elements in terms of both single market regulatory checks and customs.Exporters entering the Republic from Northern Ireland would, in the normal run of things, need to prove that their goods are from a country that is in a customs union with the bloc and that they have a rule of origin waiver.Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the leading EU thinktank the European Policy Centre, said he did not believe it would be possible for the EU to satisfy the prime minister’s demands, and that the lack of realism in the UK increased the chances of a no-deal Brexit.He said: “I don’t see the EU willing to accept a deal without the Northern Ireland-specific backstop.“What I have found concerning is that people are making very categorical statements that no British prime minister can sign a backstop on Northern Ireland which seems to go against what is agreed in December, and you hear it not from the government but also the opposition. That makes me think we are moving very quickly to a no deal.”EU diplomats have also scorned the prime minister’s suggestion that significant progress has been made on the political declaration on the future trade deal, with the economic aspects described as a “raw nerve” where the two sides are “talking about different things”.The prime minister is seeking a commitment to arrangements, including a common rule book that could deliver “frictionless trade”.Barnier has repeatedly said that this is not possible, and diplomats believe a weaker pledge for trade flows to be “as frictionless as possible” is the most likely outcome.Number 10 has said it would not accept a deal that would be as wide-ranging as some reports have suggested, encompassing May’s Chequers plan for a “common rule book”, as well as leaving the door open for a possible Canada-style deal.“We have said that we will come up with a ‘precise’ future partnership,” the Whitehall source said. “That will not be all things to all men. It will be a detailed political agreement which we can use to forge our future trading relationship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0bba0255a23f70e93ffeb2d469b00e025685fb3/0_693_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3939fa69a5ae49053e08411501106c2","title":"turing lovelace or franklin your choices for the new 50 note","story":"Readers discuss the scientists they would like to see on a new £50 note after the Bank of England asked for nominationsAlan Turing seems a popular choice here and rightly so.

Beyond that, though, the challenge is now clear for those in charge of shaping league’s future.There is much to marvel about in this burgeoning national side but the headline act here was St Helens’ Makinson. The winger was making only his third Test appearance but marked the occasion with three magnificent tries, including the winner six minutes from time.The Kiwis once again played their part in an enthralling Test. They had led through Dallin Watene-Zelezniak’s early try and, while Makinson’s first after a superb team move had levelled matters by half-time, New Zealand again moved ahead, this time when Ken Maumalo finished a searing Watene-Zelezniak break. Shaun Johnson converted and kicked a penalty to make it 14-6.“What Wayne is doing with this group is special,” was Makinson’s post-match verdict. Pre-Bennett, an eight-point deficit going into the final quarter would have spelled danger. Not for this squad, though.The hulking twins Tom and George Burgess – younger siblings of injured captain Sam – led the comeback. Scintillating ball-handling from Jonny Lomax and Jake Connor led to Makinson’s second, before Tom Burgess came desperately close to levelling the scores, the prop eventually held up by desperate New Zealand defence.However, two minutes later Connor made it 14-14 in a rare England breakthrough without Makinson – but the winger would have the decisive say. With England pressing, and only one side looking likely to score, Makinson gathered a stray pass, surged infield and elicited a roar from those inside Anfield that sounded like there was a sellout crowd here to witness it.It was 24 years ago that a group of independent consultants drew up a blueprint for British rugby league’s long-term future. Dubbed “Framing the Future”, it was a comprehensive and damning outlook on how the sport spent too much time chasing narrow geographical markets and failed to prioritise what really mattered.You could argue league never truly heeded the stark warnings in that report. But over two decades on, and with the game not fulfilling the potential many believe it has, we have now officially arrived at Framing the Future 2.0, the refresh button the sport has been crying out for. League’s administrators have spent years scouting for the panacea when it comes to domestic structure, but those who are paid extraordinary amounts to decide the game’s future surely now know how and where rugby league in this country blossoms.For all the merits of a strong domestic game, other sports – including, cover your ears league lovers, rugby union – have proven that it is at international level where you truly capture the imagination of the public.How could you not have been captivated here by the latest instalment of what is becoming an unforgettable Test series.For the neutrals, England versus New Zealand is becoming must-see sporting theatre, exposed beautifully on terrestrial television. Yet for England themselves it is clear that this is a group who deserve a much, much greater platform than it currently occupies.To build on the success of this autumn, and to get new eyes and ears on the game, the focus must be on England playing as often as possible – preferably on home soil, too. With due respect to the domestic game, Widnes versus Wakefield will not amplify league’s profile: a vibrant international game will.How appropriate, therefore, that the RLIF meet this week to map out international rugby’s long-term future. Bennett, a staunch internationalist, knows what must happen.“Get the politics out of the way, the players want to play,” he said after the thrilling victory here.“I hope people stand up for the game and give us all what we want: international rugby played between the best players.”Bennett’s appointment ruffled feathers in 2016 but he has overseen a remarkable transformation of the national side. If international rugby is properly prioritised in the years to come maybe it can dream of selling out arenas like Anfield. As for England, who knows where the future could take a group that appear to have the world at their feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6ae409b79b39d51e4f02ecfd36e5e42515f96d5/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e51f23cb908222831bcce52f0e9ef5","title":"gymnast oksana chusovitina saga brings tear to eye","story":"The gymnast, still competing at the world championships at the age of 43, once vaulted for her son’s life. Her longevity has paved the way for other mothers to remain in the sportI don’t care who knows it: gymnastics makes me cry. In a good way, I should add, not in an “is this the only sport BBC still has rights to?” way. It doesn’t matter if it’s Gabby Douglas becoming the first black gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title, or Epke Zonderland falling from the high bar and landing flat on his nose. There is something about the sheer ambition of gymnastics – coupled with the generous camaraderie that makes rivals look like the best of friends – that’s more tearjerking than an entire afternoon of Hallmark Christmas movies.This year’s world championships were always going to be emotional. And while Simone Biles’s record-breaking return to competition gave my lip a dangerous quiver, it was one of her competitors in the vault final that broke the dam. Her name was Oksana Chusovitina, and I last saw her perform two years ago at the Olympic Games in Rio. Back then, we held our breath as she prepared to execute the Produnova, the so-called vault of death – a highly dangerous routine even Biles herself had balked at because, she said “I’m not trying to die”.Chusovitina hadn’t managed to pull off the vault, or finish on the podium and her routine had changed in the two years since. In Doha she stood at the end of the runway, long hair pulled back and slicked down, her face devoid of the glittery eye-make up that many of the younger gymnasts favoured.Hers was the last vault of the final. Biles and Shallon Olsen, in first and second place respectively, shouted encouragement: “C’mon Oksana, you got this!” Alexo Moreno, in third place, couldn’t take her eyes off the floor. Chusovitina had been ill during the build-up to competition, but Moreno knew what a threat the woman with a record nine world championship medals on this apparatus posed.Chusovitina licked her palms, and sprinted at the springboard like Tom Cruise at a helicopter. Only a backward step on landing betrayed her she finished in fourth. Not bad for a 43-year-old.Chusovitina herself can be dismissive of the age gap between her and her rivals. “Perhaps it’s some sort of a sensation,” she says, “but I don’t think it is.” It’s hard for her to appreciate that to other 40-somethings – the ones taking up Pilates to fend off hereditary back trouble – her physical capabilities are as superhuman as anything Zack Snyder could imagine.My favourite quote about this Martina Navratilova of gymnastics comes from the 2008 beam champion from the Beijing Games, Shawn Johnson. “No one even knows how old she is anymore, because it seems like she’s been to the last gazillion Olympics.” Well, sure, Shawn, “seven” doesn’t have the same ring to it. But it’s still a record. More than a quarter of century in a sport that usually consigns its heroes to toothpaste endorsements and TV cameos in half that time.To me, the real power of Chusovitina’s story is not in the statistics – the fact that Biles wasn’t born when she started competing internationally, or that she has a son older than some of her teammates. It’s in the hand she was dealt and the choices she made. And it’s a particularly timely reminder that none of us choose where we are born.Chusovitina is from Uzbekistan her first international forays were under the flag of the Soviet Union. After its break-up she returned to her home country to train – in terrible conditions, on substandard equipment – and still won medals. And in 2002, when Chusovitina was on the verge of retiring, her three-year-old son Alisher was diagnosed with leukaemia.With no medical facilities in her home country capable of saving Alisher’s life, and no health insurance, Chusovitina moved to Germany, where the gymnastics community helped raise funds for his treatment. Chusovitina kept training because the prize money was a vital source of income. “If I don’t compete then my son won’t live, it’s as simple as that,” she said.The story has several happy endings. Alisher was cured and his mother found out a few days after she won her first inidual Olympic medal, in Beijing, at the age of 33. Chusovitina did eventually retire, after London 2012, and it lasted less than 12 hours. She woke up next morning and changed her mind.Last year she was the first gymnast ever inducted into her sport’s hall of fame while still active. “I feel like every year that I’m competing I’m leaving a little part of myself behind,” she said at the time. She was right. In Doha last week, four of the gymnasts competing were mothers Chusovitina had been an inspiration to them all.“Oksana is a wonderful person,” said Aliya Mustafina. “By looking at her, I understood it was possible to come back.” Sure, not every athlete has the capacity or the drive to stick at their sport as long as Chusovitina, but her longevity is already creating a legacy. And her unshowy breaking of boundaries is as worthy of celebration as any medal she missed out on in Doha.Chusovitina said she was proud to know that she had set an example. She also said that her pre-tournament sickness notwithstanding, she could see now that she was perfectly on course in her preparations to qualify for the 2020 Olympics. “I could compete with all the girls with no problems at all,” she said. “I know and I am sure that I have a goal now.” What a goal it is. If she makes it to the vault final in Tokyo, I’m going to buy shares in Kleenex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112e7d39954adb10a07605908e2fbb1ea4986175/0_94_4150_2490/master/4150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b55db754bc9a5460a8b6c95fe8d4d80","title":"owen farrell citing england rugby union autumn international south africa","story":"Owen Farrell has escaped being cited for the tackle that could have cost England victory over South Africa.The officiating of Farrell’s added-time challenge on André Esterhuizen has polarised opinion as England opened their autumn series with a backs-to-the-wall 12-11 win at Twickenham.Farrell stopped Esterhuizen in his tracks with a shoulder-led tackle to the chest without appearing to wrap an arm around the Springboks centre, but the referee, Angus Gardner, declined to award a kickable penalty.The citing commissioner, Keith Brown, decieded the challenge did not warrant a red card, which would have triggered a citing that would have threatened Farrell’s involvement against New Zealand on Saturday.Chris Ashton, the England wing, felt the decision could have gone either way, while Ben Te’o described the tackle as a “legal hit”.South Africa’s management were furious at Gardner’s failure to act, however, their coach Rassie Erasmus praising the tackle in an answer laced with sarcasm, but Farrell himself insisted there was no case to answer.“It went to the touch judge, he said check and then it all slows down. Sometimes you can take what you want from it,” Farrell said. “If you watch that full speed, he has a big run up on me and we both bounce off each other and end up on the floor. It’s hard to wrap your arms around when you’re both hitting each other at that much force, but I tried to.”When asked if he had wrapped enough arm around Esterhuizen, Farrell added: “That’s what the referee said and that’s what is most important.”The incident happened amid a clampdown on dangerous tackles with officials instructed to punish offences severely in an attempt to reduce the number of head injuries. The former international referee Jonathan Kaplan – a South African – claimed Gardner made the wrong decision, adding that Farrell’s “arm wrapping around is an afterthought”.Te’o, England’s inside centre, insisted the tackle looked worse than the reality of it. “It was a legal hit. Sometimes when a big shot is made on the chest, the head whips back,” he said. “It can look bad in real time, but when you slow it down it’s a chest shot. He had his arm to wrap, so it was a legal hit.“Owen almost knocked himself out.That’s Owen – he plays with a lot of passion and he really wanted to finish with a win, so it was a big shot.”Apart from the late drama, Farrell was an inspirational presence who propelled England to victory through force of will as a remarkable defensive performance morphed into a series of frantic attacks.At the heart of the fightback was the Saracens playmaker, who showed steely resilience to recover from an thunderous earlier tackle by Esterhuizen.“Owen was intense. He really wanted it so bad. He was banged up and was struggling to get through that, but he soldiered on,” Te’o added. “His whole life is rugby. The guy loves rugby. It’s all he’s about.“He lives, breathes it, talks about it. Nothing else but rugby. He wants it bad and he wants to be successful. He puts in a lot of work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bf88358ef51f073e739a7adf8cd97cbbdb305f/0_277_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f3852fff3de57b8404f64f4e59fe0f","title":"pret a porter marliyn stafford 1960 paris montmartre","story":"In 1950s Paris, photographer Marilyn Stafford was commissioned to capture the glamour and elegance of a new fashion concept – prêt-à-porter.She took models out of the studios and into the gritty working-class areas of the French capital, where they attracted the attention of curious children playing in the streets.The result was a collection of black-and-white photographs showcasing the likes of Chanel and Givenchy that reflect both the style and the darker, dirtier side of the City of Light.In this shot, a pouting child in a well-worn dress and scuffed boots sits perched on railings on the Montmartre steps, in stark contrast to the designer-clad model who is gesturing theatrically.“I loved the streets.

Don’t read ahead if you haven’t seen episode five, The Tsuangra Condundrum.This week, we see another side to the Doctor rarely glimpsed she’s vulnerable and in pain. For reasons best known to themselves, Team Tardis have to decided to play around with some metal detectors on a scavenger planet. What should have been a fun day off takes another unfortunate turn when they find a sonic mine, get blown to smithereens (although curiously without a scratch on them) and picked up by an automated spaceship hospital that’s been infiltrated by an unwelcome cargo. So Jodie spends half the episode staggering about clutching her midriff, or ‘ectospleen’ in Timelord parlance before jolting into Doctorish action.To its credit, The Tsunagra Condumdrum boasts an awesome spaceship, an impressive guest cast (led by Casualty’s Suzanne Packer as General Cicero), a wonderfully deadpan android and an amusing subplot involving a pregnant man. To its detriment, there’s a rather over-reliance of exposition–ish pseudo-science (the antimatter passage just went on) and once again, here is an episode without very much of a real villain. And come to think of it, there isn’t really much of a “conundrum” to speak of at all. This was whizzy and bright and perfectly fine. But call me old-fashioned, right now I’m crying out for a jolly good alien invasion.Now we’re at the halfway point, how is everyone feeling about Chris Chibnall’s tenure thus far? While I’ve yet to be absolutely blown away to the extent of Steven Moffat in his pomp, it’s also worth remembering that it took him a little while to get there too. The upside to that, though, is there hasn’t been a total dud either. In that, cutting the episode order to 10 near negates the risk of any duds. Certainly, the extra time and money that goes on each episode is showing up on screen – there has never been a more handsome-looking version of this programme.Chibnall is not a comedy writer of the kind that Moffat was, so I’m learning to accept that it’s not going to make me laugh out loud the way it did before. The shift from magic realism to urban grit has also taken a bit of getting used to, but what Chibnall might lack in lols, he’s certainly making up for in emotional heft.And, just quickly, look how quickly the issue of Jodie’s gender became a complete non-conversation from the moment she appeared on screen.Life aboard the TardisTosin Cole once again gets the big emotional moment, and your heart continues to break over Ryan’s Daddy issues. The Yoss subplot does give him a certain amount of resolution, realising how ill-equipped he would feel as a parent. But as he assures the new father, “You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to be there,” we get the sense that we’ve not seen the last emo moment from the young Mr Sinclair. Yaz remains reliable, plucky and underused, while Graham, still something of a wuss, is able to impart some wisdom suited to his years to his fellow patients. While also letting slip that he’s partial to a bit of Call the Midwife. Each to their own.We talked a bit last week about Chibnall identifying the things that scare adults. And once again, he’s on the money with both hospitals and childbirth. Meanwhile, the Perting was another masterfully rendered piece of visual effects, even if the creature itself was rather more of a comedy creation than a genuinely scary menace. It put me in mind of the Adipose from 2008’s Partners in Crime. “It won’t eat us, but it’ll eat the ship we’re on.”In the search for some kind of story arc (or lack of one), we’re left wondering if the numerous references and made-up phrases are red herrings, or clues as to something more significant. Are we to read much into the Book of Celebrants? What is it like to go rainbathing in the upward tropics of Kinstano?

They take to the floor for their final dance to ‘If I Could Turn Back Time’ by Cher, with bonus shimmy. Judging time! Craig saves Dr. Ranj and Janette (unexpected!), but Darcey saves Charles and Karen. Bruno also Charles and Karen, so Shirley has the deciding vote. She chooses Charles and Karen, which means DR. RANJ AND JANETTE are leaving the competition. It’s a shame to see him go, but he’s given us plenty to smile about for the last seven weeks, and I’ve enjoyed seeing him and Janette signing little messages in Makaton as they come down the stairs at the beginning of each show (it was ‘fireworks’ yesterday).Time for Charles and Karen – this Waltz is just lovely, and it definitely looks like he’s trying to flatten out the rise and fall and add a bit more glide. Gawjus. Dance off time! Ranj and Janette’s dance off is still full of fireworks and sparklers, and George Michael is still spinning in his grave. Rather unusually, this week’s dance off features two dances I really don’t mind watching again. Don’t really want to choose between these two, but Charles is definitely the better dancer and will probably stay unless he completely muffs it. Ah that’s a shame – I know Dr. Ranj isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m a sucker for an underdog as long as they’re putting the effort in (Scott Mills, anyone?). That said, I’m pretty sure Ranj is running out of party dances, although I was quite looking forward to him and Janette busting some street dance moves for Couple’s Choice. So who is joining Charles and Karen in the dance off? Ashley and Pasha are safe, along with Lauren and AJ, Graeme and Oti and Danny and Amy! Which means DR. RANJ AND JANETTE are the second couple in the bottom two.The absolute STATE of Darcey’s outfit. I think that’s a new Strictly low.Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of gravel-voiced pop banger machine Jess Glynne, who is wearing a space blanket. She’s had more chart number ones than any other British female in history, by essentially taking the same song to the top of the charts six times. Good work, Jess Glynne.Jess has also spurned her own backing dancers in favour of Nadiya and a shirtless Graziano, so I instantly like her more than Rita Ora.So which couples are safely through to next week? Joe and Dianne are safe, along with Kate and Aljaz (well saved, people), Faye and Giovanni and Stacey and Kevin. First couple in the bottom two: CHARLES AND KAREN. Oh poor Charles, he really doesn’t deserve to be in the bottom two this week – his Viennese Waltz was one of my favourite dances last night.Last night on Strictly: a top notch Foxtrot, a couple of nice Waltzes, an off-time Quickstep, an emo Jive and a bunch of other stuff that’s already left my heavily congested head.I did watch Stacey and Kevin’s Couple’s Choice again today, and struggled a bit to get my head around it – it seemed to be a combination of contemporary, street AND theatre, which I don’t think was the brief. Beautifully danced, but I didn’t really get it – since it’s such a new style, did it really need a twist?TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a shredded wetsuit, Claudia in a halterneck binbag.Out come the judges! Darcey and Shirley have ditched last night’s upholstery in favour of massive bows and ruffles. Darcey looks like a frill-necked lizard. Goodness, this is quite gymnastic. Nothing says R-E-S-P-E-C-T like flashing your knickers at the nation. Tonight’s opening pro dance is a tribute to the magnificent Aretha Franklin. All our female pros are dressed as various Quality Streets, presumably because they were Aretha’s favourite. Clearly not a fan of the Toffee Deluxe, however.

But ordinary people, wary of the fluctuations of the currency and the rising prices of goods, are anxious.On Sunday, a state-organised rally took place in front of the former US embassy compound in central Tehran to mark the anniversary. The crowd held placards reading “Down with USA”, and “Down with Israel”, while others set US and Israeli flags on fire.“Never threaten the Iranian people,” Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander of Iran’s elite revolutionary guards told people gathering in front of the former embassy, officially referred to as a “den of spies”. “Do not make military threats against us, and do not frighten us with military threats,” he added.The US president, Donald Trump, announced the reimposition of sanctions by tweeting on Friday a photograph of himself in the style of an advertisement for the Game of Thrones fantasy TV series, with the tagline: “Sanctions Are Coming, November 5”. The office of Iran’s Quds force commander, Qassem Soleimani, retaliated by posting a photo of himself in a similar style alongside the tagline: “I will stand against you.”Inside Iran, however, people are on tenterhooks. Economic grievances were a trigger for a wave of nationwide protests in recent months over the scarcity of the US dollar, unpaid wages and rising prices.“Nov 5th isn’t the most pivotal moment in this saga,” said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. “Paradoxically, if sanctions prove as effective as the White House is hoping for, they are bound to push Iran to either revive its nuclear program or become more aggressive in the region. Both will significantly increase the risks of a military confrontation.”Iran is relying on European support. The EU has set up a mechanism – known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) – to sidestep US sanctions and persuade an increasingly reluctant Iran to stay inside the deal in the hope of rescuing its economy.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reacting to Trump’s threats on Saturday, said America’s power was in decline. “The US’s goal in imposing sanctions is to paralyse and prevent the growth of national economy but it resulted in a movement towards self-sufficiency in Iran,” he said.Worries about the impacts of the new blanket sanctions are particularly high among Iran’s health sector. Ahmad Ghavideh, the head of Iran’s haemophilia society, said the lives of at least 12,000 patients with bleeding disorders in Iran will be put at immediate risk when the country’s supply of medicine runs out.“We believe that sanctions are in fact worse than waging a classic war, because when you’re in the war situation at least civilian buildings, and targets are supposed to be spared, while with sanctions in this scale, a whole nation has been targeted,” he said.A group of respected Iranian mental health professionals signed a letter saying that Iranian people’s access to life-saving medication and medical supplies is getting “seriously jeopardised”.“Given the indirect toll on human wellbeing, economic sanctions can hence be regarded as a sugarcoated but full-fledged war with the caveat that people die not because of bombs and bullets, but rather as a result of a reduction in access to health care,” they wrote.“Ordinary Iranian people are the ones who are most seriously suffering from the crippling US-imposed sanctions, which has created a grave burden on their sense of wellbeing and mental health.”An Iranian student at the Leiden University in the Netherlands said the future of his education was at risk because he relied on his family for his education costs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2acbd686aab1b94332386133a7b7729e64653f/0_146_4359_2615/master/4359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=297728417e859bef6e77132cbfffa353","title":"new caledonia votes non to independence from france","story":"The South Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia has voted against independence from France in a long-awaited referendum that capped a 30-year long decolonisation process.“The New Caledonians have chosen to remain French ... It is a vote of confidence in the French republic, its future and its values,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech on French television.The referendum was the first auto-determination vote to be held in a French territory since Djibouti in the Horn of Africa voted for independence in 1977.Voters in the largely self-governing territory had been asked the question: “Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?”Macron said he understood the disappointment of those who wanted independence, but added that the French state would ensure liberty, equality and fraternity for everyone.Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris.Over the past decade, relations between the two groups have improved markedly, but the no vote outcome was well below some early polls, which could encourage nationalists to try for a new referendum in coming years.During a visit to the archipelago in May, Macron acknowledged the “pains of colonisation” and saluted the “dignified” campaign for autonomy led by the Kanaks. He and his administration sought to strike a neutral tone on the vote.It enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defence and education. Its position gives France a foothold in the Indo-Pacific region where China is expanding its presence.The New Caledonia archipelago lies more than 16,700 km (10,377 miles) from France. It became a French colony in 1853.Under colonial rule the Kanaks were confined to reserves and excluded from much of the island’s economy. Fighting broke out in the mid-1980s amid festering anger over poverty and poor job opportunities.A 1988 massacre in a cave on the island of Ouvéa left 19 indigenous separatists and two French soldiers dead and intensified talks on the island’s future. A 1998 deal provided for a referendum on independence to be held by the end of 2018.Under the terms of that deal, in the event of a no vote, two further referendums can be held before 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ec49945f1078d56bedeffc08db9fd391d359f0/0_916_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f1ebe69585ee10663787a633246425","title":"wild boar sighted near barcelona city centre looking for food","story":"The animals, usually resident in nearby hills, are venturing close to the Sagrada FamíliaThe wild boar that roam the hills above Barcelona are becoming ever more daring in their search for food.While for some time they have been a familiar sight in the neighbourhoods adjacent to the thickly wooded hills, they have now been spotted in areas closer to the city centre.Last week three were seen crossing the street near the Sant Pau hospital, which is close to the Sagrada Família, the city’s top tourist attraction. A day later three more were photographed near the Mercè market in the Nou Barris area of the city.The wild boar breed freely in the Collserola hills where they have no predators and there are few hunters. In recent years the city authorities have taken measures to control their numbers and claim that this year there have been only 369 reported sightings within the city, compared to 1,187 in 2016.“In the areas closest to the Collserola we have blocked bins so they can’t get at food and we have also discouraged people from putting food out for cats as this attracts the boars,” said Carme Maté, head of the city’s animal rights and urban ecology department.However, it appears that these very controls are part of what is driving the animals to seek food further afield.The creatures, which can weigh as much as 113kg (250lbs), are generally harmless unless cornered or are females with their young. However, a study published earlier this year by researchers at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona found that wild pigs that had become accustomed to eating discarded human food were more likely to behave aggressively towards people."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoSewer\u0026rsquo of British politics is unleasing \u0026lsquodemons\u0026rsquo over Brexit, says Aaron BanksGarda\u0026iacute say one car hit a parked car and then struck a 51-year-old womanEngineering teams have worked through the weekend to complete remedial worksResidents express horror and concern about knife attackKayaker in her 30s dies after \u0026lsquotragic accident\u0026rsquo during trip down the Roughty riverThree are seen close to Sagrada Familia as crackdown helps drive animals into the city\u0026lsquoI never meant for him to die.

The CervicalCheck situation was a very difficult time for women in Ireland.“They felt let down. The women were and are the Minister’s priority. Tony O’Brien took the decision to step down from his post. The Minister believes that was the right decision. He wishes him well.”Mr O’Brien stood down as HSE director general on May 10th, several weeks before his contract was scheduled to expire, in the midst of the controversy over cervical cancer screening.In his interview, he also said he believed the Dáil Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - which held a number of hearings on the cervical cancer controversy - had conducted itself like a “kangaroo court” and he accused Sinn Féin of being particularly destructive.Meanwhile, Minister or Justice Charlie Flanagan said Mr O’Brien’s comments about Mr Harris were “totally out of order” and he “did himself no favours” by using personalised language.Mr Flanagan said Mr O’Brien had a “pretty rapid fall from grace himself” and he described Mr Harris as a dynamic and committed Minister. “I don’t think there’s any more diligent colleague around the Cabinet table,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3686012.1541350633!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"backstop agreement may be close but brexit deal is far from certain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe removal of references to a Northern Ireland-only customs arrangement could make the Northern element of the backstop easier to sell to Tory unionism. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesWhen British and EU negotiators resume their Brexit talks on Monday they will re-enter what Sabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, has called “the tunnel”, a mutually agreed shutdown of external comment and spin which is supposed to facilitate their work. This time, however, according to up-beat weekend stories from Brussels, London, and Dublin trumpeting the “imminence” of a deal on the crucial Irish backstop – a guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what the outcome of future trade talks between the EU and UK – may be light at the end of this one. Theresa May has a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and the Commons goes into recess on Wednesday when EU ambassadors also meet again to assess progress. When the British solemnly agreed with the EU last December in the Joint Agreement to the necessity for a legally enforceable insurance - backstop - against a hard border in Ireland, they fudged the issue of how that would be achieved. The EU took the view that this could only be accomplished by some forms of controls on the Irish Sea between the UK and the North. London decided, however, that this was a red line it would not cross, and suggested instead that it would create an all-UK customs arrangement with the EU. Since then we have been struggling to reconcile the two positions.Among the approaches currently being mooted, sources here and in Dublin suggest, is a formula that would remove EU-proposed references to an exclusively Northern Ireland customs union framework from the backstop, but leave in place strict provisions for the North’s continued, and separate, regulatory alignment with the EU (and checks on the Irish Sea or in the marketplace on goods and animals travelling between the North and Britain). That could be done, sources say, either by removing references to customs arrangements, but leaving in place all their ingredients – like those deconstructed dishes so-favoured by chefs in reality cooking shows – or by removing all the Northern Ireland-specific customs-related provisions in their entirety, and relying instead on the British proposals for an all-UK customs arrangement with the UK.That might be acceptable to the EU and Ireland, but only if there is agreement on how to frame the UK proposal of a “temporary” all-UK customs arrangement in such a way as to make it a binding Withdrawal Agreement (WA) commitment. This version of a backstop would mean that after transition – and before the much-promised comprehensive future relationship is negotiated – the UK would be obliged to remain in a customs relationship with the EU, but would also have to put regulatory barriers at Dover and Channel ports. The removal, however accomplished, from the protocol of references to a Northern Ireland-only customs arrangement could make the Northern element of the backstop easier to sell to Tory unionism – the customs border is particularly toxic for reasons that are not altogether clear.And it might be easier to impose on the DUP as a less-than-perfect but necessary solution to avoid a no-deal. A confrontation that everyone bar the DUP now believes will be necessary.To date the idea of an all-UK customs union solution has been legally fraught because the EU insists that the idea is legally precluded from a binding Article 50 “orce” agreement. It is, they say, a matter for the future relationship treaty, currently only being drafted as a political declaration.There is talk of trying to construct a legal “bridge” between the two agreements. But the issue of enforceability of such a provision is crucial.Ultimately, an all-UK customs backstop would have to stay in place until a new “better” deal is agreed in the context of the permanent future relationship deal. A “better” deal is one that would better safeguard the Irish frictionless border – one logically, it appears to most observers, that involves British continued membership of a customs union and most single market regulations. The British continue to insist that will not happen.Effectively, in other words, by signing up to an all-UK customs backstop the UK, though it does not admit it publicly, would be committing itself to a permanent customs union arrangement for itself for the sake of not signing up to separate arrangements for the North. As the DUP rightly keeps saying “the backstop is for good”.In what is effectively a private acknowledgment of that reality, and fearful that the EU and Ireland could forever block the ending of the backstop by insisting on what the UK would see as an unrealisable standard for a “better” deal, British negotiators are understood to have been trying to explore the idea of third party arbitration. The draft protocol contains a reference to the backstop remaining in place “unless and until” a better deal is agreed. Could the interpretation of that phrase and the ending of the need for a backstop be given to an independent third party? Not, of course, the British say, the Court of Justice of the EU...While we may be close to an agreement on the backstop, the complexity and interconnectedness of the few remaining issues makes agreement far from certain. The light at the end of this single-track tunnel may not be daylight, but a fast-approaching no-deal train.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

far right overtakes macron eu parliament election poll","story":"The party of French far-Right leader Marine Le Pen has overtaken the president\u0026#39s in European Parliament voting intentionsMarine Le Pen’s National Rally has overtaken the centrist party of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, for the first time, according to an opinion poll released Sunday, in a further sign of the rise of the far-Right in Europe.The Ifop poll measured voting intentions for European Parliament elections next May, seen as a decisive battle between pro-EU liberals and Eurosceptic populists that could be pivotal in shaping the future of the European Union after Brexit.Liberals championed by Mr Macron are attempting to fend off a rising anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic wave led by Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Matteo Salvini, Italy’s influential deputy prime minister.The poll showed Ms Le Pen’s party, formerly known as the Front National, with 21 per cent of voting intentions compared to 19 per cent for Mr Macron’s La Republique En Marche (LREM) party.Together with the seven per cent of people planning to vote for a smaller far-Right party, Stand Up France, and two per cent going for two small “Frexit” parties, the French far-Right has won 30 per cent of voting intentions, a five-point gain since August, according to the poll.In a landmark victory, the Front National won the largest share of the French vote in the last European elections in 2014, when the Socialist Party held power in France.Mr Macron is leading the campaign for the 2019 European elections, which he has described as “a contest between progressives and nationalists”.A woman holds the hand of French President Emmanuel Macron as he is greeted by people after leaving a restaurant on November 1, 2018He said it angered him to see posters with slogans such as “Stop Brussels”, arguing that EU membership had brought countries such as Hungary and Poland greater prosperity.Last week he urged Europeans to “resist” what he called “the nationalist leprosy”.He said: “The moment we are living through resembles the period between the two world wars…In a Europe ided by fear, the nationalist withdrawal, the consequences of the economic crisis, one sees almost methodically the recurrence of everything that set the pace of European life from the end of the First World War to the Great Depression of 1929.”Nevertheless, the French president’s approval ratings have plunged to 21 per cent amid rising discontent over his failure to fulfil his election pledges to slash unemployment, boost growth and cut taxes.Fuel price increases stemming from tax increases justified as an anti-pollution measure have alienated rural and small-town voters, and the president has also been damaged by a scandal over his bodyguard who was filmed beating protesters.Ms Le Pen’s party appears to be the only opposition group benefiting from Mr Macron’s unpopularity.The far-Left France Unbowed party, whose leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon took nearly 20 per cent of the vote in the first round of France’s presidential election last year, fell three points to 11 per cent in the European election poll.At a glance | The seven branches of the European UnionMr Mélenchon has been widely mocked for yelling at police during a raid on his party offices as part of an anti-corruption investigation. The largest opposition party, the centre-Right Republicans, have also failed to gain support, slipping two points to 13 per cent, according to the poll.Their strategy of demanding tougher EU policies on immigration and terrorism appears not to have won over far-Right voters.Other European centre-Right parties are ided over how to handle ties with populists such as Mr Orban as they face a future without Mrs Merkel as their standard-bearer.The German chancellor announced last week that she would step down within three years.This week they will meet in Helsinki to choose a leader of the centre-Right European People’s Party (EPP), currently the largest group in the European Parliament.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, is an EPP veteran.Populist parties’ gains have increased fears in Brussels that anti-immigrant Eurosceptic parties may wield greater clout after the May elections.Please review our commenting policyStrictly

Both these options will further depress investment. They will be bad for business and bad for working people.“Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People\u0027s Vote.”Lord Myners, who was appointed as city minister by Gordon Brown in 2008 but now sits as a crossbencher, said: “Any deal will be made from a position of weakness where we have surrendered our principal negotiating cards.“It will be half-formed, casting a long shadow over business confidence, damaging investment and hurting both enterprises and their employees for years to come.”A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, that works for business and the economy.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The then Tesco boss had just collected the Management Today Most Admired Company and Most Admired Company Leader awards. He was the king of retail, responsible for propelling Tesco to dominance. I asked Leahy what was the pivotal moment, when Tesco began to defeat the competition? He said it was when employees were ordered to think only Tesco, they could no longer refer to something Sainsbury’s, the market leader, had done and how they could ape it. From now on, it was just Tesco. The policy led to the Tesco Clubcard, Tesco  and other innovations, and, after a while, to Tesco’s hegemony. I was thinking of this in relation to Jack’s, Tesco’s new discount chain. Perhaps I am missing something but I cannot see the logic for it. Jack’s is a distraction, a gimmick, one that will not make any difference to Tesco profits and may even end up eroding them. Jack’s: Everything we know so far about Tesco’s new discount storeTesco’s new discount chain Jack’s will be ‘cheapest in town’ Tesco\u0027s Jack\u0027s has a silly name but it\u0027s a better bet than Asbury\u0027s Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoLet’s believe, however, that Tesco, which went downhill towards the end of the Leahy reign, endured a slump, and is now being revitalised under Dave Lewis, really does see Jack’s as vital to its future prosperity. If so, they appear to have forgotten the Leahy lesson.Jack’s is clearly an attempt to follow the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl. But what Lewis and his cohorts have created is confusing. It’s called Jack’s, in deference to Tesco founder\u0026nbspSir Jack Cohen. He was a great “pile it high, sell it cheap” operator, so for a Tesco budget label, that makes sense. However, in a clear slug at the Germans and their sourcing, Jack’s boasts that “8 out of 10 products are British”\u0026nbspand as backup, there are Union Jacks everywhere. Presumably, based on research showing that some consumers aren’t thrilled with Germanic produce, Tesco has decided to strike a blow for Britain. But that does not make sense, either, because more than enough shoppers are completely content with Aldi and Lidl’s wares. The effect in a Jack’s is to feel like a declaration of war, with Aldi and Lidl firmly installed as the enemy. From the off, Tesco is fighting on someone else’s terms, not its own. And that goes against the Leahy doctrine. Then there’s the size. Tesco is aiming to have 12 stores by Christmas. That equates to a couple of hundred thousand square feet versus a total UK footprint for Tesco of 35 million square feet. Jack’s is a blip on Tesco, so small as to be immaterial. That’s the number of Jack’s stores Tesco is aiming to open eventually, according to reportsEven if Jack’s reached 90 outlets, thought to be the masterplan, that would be insignificant against Tesco’s 3,000. Why bother? Why ert so much effort and management attention on something that does not matter? Being so tiny brings with it another problem. It’s not worth suppliers having a dedicated production line for a mere 12 stores. So Jack’s own-label goods must be Tesco own-label repackaged as Jack’s. Not only does that open up the prospect of cannibalisation, as shoppers who would otherwise purchase the Tesco item buy the same one more cheaply at Jack’s, but the Jack’s margin is being drastically slashed. \u0026nbspNow comes the appliance-of-science bit. Anyone who supposes Aldi and Lidl just push out stock at low prices is wrong. There is calculation in every single thing they do.A fascinating article by advertising planning guru John Lowery (he’s advised Lidl among many others) sheds much light on how they operate. Lowery toured the first Jack’s, at Chatteris, with ex-Lidl boss, Ronny Gottschlich. First they meet iced doughnuts – hundreds, if not thousands, of them. How many can the people of Chatteris eat? But there are no plain and chocolate doughnuts. They’re out of stock. As are the ready meals, but, says Ronny, “The fridge is on. They’re wasting electricity.” Gottschlich produces his ruler and measures the shelf depth. There’s 94mm at the back that is empty, doing nothing. That translates into redundant metal, and cost. All over the store there is Jack’s own label. “That means they can’t get as close to mimicking the brands that they’re trying to gain sales from.” Out comes the stopwatch. It takes an assistant 11.2 seconds to rip off the lid of the box of cooked ham. In Lidl, the perforations are deeper and the packaging\u0026nbspcomes away more easily, in a maximum of 5.3 seconds. Which means the worker can get on with another task. Same with the bleach bottles. In Jack’s, the labels all face the front. Someone has arranged them like that, but such decorative precision takes time. In Lidl, they’re not, “Because it’s a waste of man-hours. The shoppers know it’s bleach. You could be doing something else… like manning the tills.” There are two sizes of\u0026nbsptrollies. “Why? It increases costs.”Gottschlich discovers that four out of five staff at the Jack’s previously worked in a Tesco. “There you go. They’ve learned to turn the packs round at Tesco. It will take months to knock that kind of behaviour out of them.”In obsessing about Aldi and Lidl, in creating Jack’s, Tesco is ceasing to be Tesco. And forgetting the instruction of its former brilliant chief.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sleek rockets and square-jawed heroes, damsels in distress menaced by slimy, tentacled aliensIn August this year, the writer NK Jemisin was called to the stage at the World Science Fiction Convention in San Jose to collect her third consecutive Hugo Award for the best novel of the year.Three wins on the trot for one of the most venerable and hotly contested awards in science fiction is remarkable enough. The fact that Jemisin is a black woman made her winning streak all the more historic.It’s probably something that shouldn’t even need to be mentioned after all, the contemporary science fiction scene is more erse than it has ever been in its history, and women writers and people of colour are the norm, not the exception.This week the reader review site Goodreads launched its annual Goodreads Choice Awards. There are 15 titles in the first round in the science fiction category seven are written by women. Only four are written by white men.Who was the black science fiction pioneer Octavia E Butler?Women in science fiction: whither the brides of Frankenstein?So why is it worth talking about at all? Because the origins of the contemporary science fiction field were anything but erse, as outlined in a new book, Astounding, by Alec Nevala-Lee.Astounding takes a certain focus in the look at the history of science fiction literature, looking at the start of what is commonly called the Golden Age, which is generally accepted to have run from about 1939 to 1950.Even if you’re not particularly au fait with the world of science fiction writing, some of the names from that era will certainly be recognisable Isaac Asimov, who wrote a multitude of novels and short stories including the sequence which was loosely adapted into the movie I, Robot, starring Will Smith. Robert A Heinlein, author of\u0026nbspStranger in a Strange Land, Have Spacesuit – Will Travel, and Starship Troopers (among a plethora more), the latter of which also got the big screen treatment in 1997. L Ron Hubbard, who later became much more notorious as the founder of the Church of Scientology but, back in the 1930s, was one of the triumvirate of young writers, along with Asimov and Heinlein, who form the narrative backbone of Nevala-Lee’s history.Jemisin’s multiple Hugo Award wins? (Laura Hanifin)But the book is also – and primarily – the story of John W Campbell, who won’t have the same recognition factor, but who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of science fiction.Campbell was born in 1910 in Newark, New Jersey, and had a prolific writing career until he was appointed editor of Astounding magazine in 1938. He brought on and encouraged Asimov, Heinlein and Hubbard – three very different and often conflicting characters – and ushered in the Golden Age.When we think of the Golden Age we think of the classic science fiction tropes. Optimistic futurism at a time when the real world was chugging towards global warfare. Sleek rockets and square-jawed heroes, damsels in distress menaced by slimy, tentacled aliens.It’s an image of science fiction that is largely absent in the form today, but back in the late 1930s, perhaps because the world was rapidly becoming a rather dreadful place, this unique brand of escapism began to gain traction.\u0026nbspIf you wanted your science fiction in the Golden Age, it came in the written form. Magazines such as ‘Astounding’ proliferated and serialised novels or published short fictionIt was still, from the mainstream point of view, a relatively niche genre. Today, science fiction is ubiquitous. TV and streaming services such as Netflix are full of it – Stranger Things, The Handmaid’s Tale, Black Mirror. Doctor Who is enjoying one of its most notable periods ever. At the multiplexes, people who would never consider themselves science fiction fans routinely push films such as the Star Wars franchise, Ready Player One, the Marvel movies, to the top of the box office lists.\u0026nbspBut back in the Golden Age, sci-fi was largely absent at the movie theatres, save for the chapter serials featuring Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, and it wasn’t until the 1950s that the schlocky drive-in alien invasion craze started, fuelled by post-war fears about communism and the enemy within. TV didn’t really catch up until the 1960s, with Star Trek, The Outer Limits, Land of the Giants.So if you wanted your science fiction in the Golden Age, it came in the written form. Magazines such as Astounding proliferated and serialised novels or published short fiction. This is where the genre was really born, and something else was minted as well the image, which stood for a very long time, of science fiction as something almost exclusively white and male.Nevala-Lee notes that the science fiction that Campbell decided to shape was all about “the competent man” – the hero who would save the world, the galaxy, the universe. Nevala-Lee writes that Campbell’s term “points to the way in which science fiction encourages certain assumptions. Editors like Campbell tended to favour writers who looked like them, and from the start, fandom was overwhelmingly male. Women were often regarded with suspicion, and even when they were welcomed, they could still be treated poorly.”Though Campbell occupies a special place in science fiction history, he held some pretty abhorrent views. His omission of black characters, for example, wasn’t just something to put down to him being “a man of his time”, or ignorance it was a wilful decision.Nevala-Lee quotes Campbell as saying, “Think about it a bit, and you’ll realise why there is so little mention of blacks in science fiction we see no reason to go saying ‘Lookee lookee lookee! We’re using blacks in our stories! See the Black Man! See him in a space ship”. Nevala-Lee observes: “The implication was that protagonists should be white males by default – a stance that he might not even have seen as problematic.”Campbell was also stoutly anti-feminist, saying that women who demanded equal rights also refused to give up what he considered their “girlish special privileges”. He once declared, “No woman has ever attained first-rank competence in literature in any Indo-European language.”It’s not that there weren’t science fiction writers who were people of colour or women\u0026nbsp(or both) back in the Golden Age… it’s just that they didn’t get a look in. Samuel R Delany, now 76, is considered one of the most important writers in the genre ever. He’s also African-American, and gay (Campbell had a lot to say about homosexuality, as well, and none of it good). While once grudgingly admitting of Delany “this guy can write and has a lot of brilliant ideas” he constantly rejected Delany’s submissions, and turned down the novel Nova – which would go on to be a rightly-regarded classic. Delany recalled that Campbell “didn’t feel his readership would be able to relate to a black main character”.Campbell did publish several women writers, though later on in his career, including Anne McCaffrey, Kate Wilhelm and Alice Sheldon, whose first story “The Birth of a Salesman” appeared in one of Campbell’s alter magazines, Analog, in 1967. Sheldon wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr, saying: “A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I’ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.” It wasn’t until 1977 that it became widely known that Tiptree was actually a woman.All of this contributed to the idea of science fiction being a boy’s club, and a white boy’s club at that. But what Nevala-Lee’s book does is put the spotlight back on women who have been airbrushed out of most official histories of the Golden Age, particularly Campbell’s first wife Dona, Heinlein’s first wife Leslyn, and perhaps the true hero of the story, Campbell’s assistant Kay Tarrant.All of them were instrumental in keeping Astounding afloat in the early days indeed when the war arrived and all four of the principal male characters in this story had to interrupt their careers to join up, Robert A Heinlein wanted to get Dona and Kay appointed editors of the magazine in his absence.Guin, who died earlier this year, presided over American science fiction for nearly half a century (Getty)Campbell generally referred to Kay Tarrant as his secretary, but in truth she did the lion’s share of the work, going through fiction submissions for Campbell to approve, overseeing proofreading, copy-editing, administration and production of Astounding and Campbell’s other magazines, a job she did for 30 years.The science fiction world that Campbell and his stable of writers created endured for years, but he began to lose touch with the genre especially as the 1960s dawned. The world was changing and Campbell’s white, male enclave was becoming increasingly irrelevant. A new sort of science fiction was emerging, which was dubbed New Wave. Just as, a decade later, punk would sweep away the pomp of prog rock, New Wave tackled all the things that Campbell thought were anathema in science fiction – sex, gender, drugs, post-modernism, politics – and mocked the stout, square-jawed heroes of the pulp years.Women writers, so long kept in the shadows of science fiction, began to emerge and thrive. Writers such as Joanna Russ and her novels, including The Female Man, gained prominence, and in this period Ursula K Le Guin began to achieve what would be a climb towards a place at the very top of the literary world.\u0026nbspNew Wave burned brightly, but for a relatively short period, into the 1970s. It did not perhaps herald the dawn of a new, equitable, erse age as many hoped, at least not straight away. But it did demonstrate that a democratisation of science fiction was underway, and the grip of Campbell was loosed and eventually lost.Nevala-Lee says:\u0026nbsp“Science fiction is too large now to be directed or defined by any one person, but this book concentrates on a period in which one man was thought to oversee it – until many of his readers broke free. Campbell liked to say that the genre’s true protagonist was all of mankind, but he saw it in terms of heroic figures, starting with himself.“If his audience ultimately refused to fall in line it led, paradoxically, to the outcome that he wanted. Science fiction became an ongoing collaboration between writers and fans, and the most convincing proof of Campbell’s success is that he lost control of it.Ursula K Le Guin: Giant of Science fictionDespite his viewpoints on so many things, Campbell is still revered today as one of the founding fathers of contemporary science fiction, as are his collaborators Asimov, Heinlein and Hubbard. To say they were all, in their own ways, problematic is an understatement. Asimov is considered one of the all-time greats, but Nevala-Lee outlines in detail his proclivity for pinching women’s behinds at science fiction conventions, something he seemed to see as a bit of fun but which, quite rightly today, would have him marked out as a serial assaulter.What would Campbell have made of NK Jemisin’s multiple Hugo Award wins? We can only guess, along with his thoughts on the success of authors such as Nnedi Okorafor, or Kameron Hurley, or Ann Leckie, or any of the women who are currently dominating science fiction with female-led stories that upend expectations and blast the traditional old tropes so beloved of the Golden Age into the sun. We can only guess, but it’s fair to say that his thoughts would not have been very pretty.And that’s not to say that the battle is won. In recent years there have been attempts to lead a backlash against the increasing ersity in science fiction, especially in America where concerted campaigns to keep the likes of Jemisin off the awards ballots have been prevalent, orchestrated by white men who miss the days of robust, heterosexual heroes rescuing grateful, lissom women from the clutches of salacious alien marauders. Indeed, one of these campaigns overtly called for “a Campbellian revolution” in science fiction.John W Campbell is one of those figures around who the argument will endlessly rage about whether it is possible to celebrate the art from the artist, whether his views perpetually colour his achievements, or if we can or cannot deny the effect and influence he had on the science fiction genre, and whether it would be the same without him.And, in the end, it doesn’t matter. Campbell was what he was, and he did what he did. He didn’t create science fiction, nor did he own it. It was an important period in history, but one that has passed. Science fiction today is new and wondrous and inclusive, and perhaps, in years to come, historians will be referring to this, not the Campbell era, as the true Golden Age.‘Astounding’, by Alec Nevala-Lee, is out now, published by Dey St BooksShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But its high street outlets in the UK suffered a 1 per cent decline and fell by 6 per cent in Ireland.Paddy Power Betfair chief executive Peter Jackson said: Quarter three was a good quarter for the group. In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

weeksClick to followThe IndependentAn overlooked contributor to the discovery of the DNA double helix and the world’s most famous cosmologist are among those in the running to be the new face of the £50 note.The Bank of England has invited the public to submit the names of\u0026nbspscientific figures they’d like to appear on the new banknote, with a decision set to be announced in six weeks.A shortlist will be drawn up by an expert committee including space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and physicist Simon Singh, with the final decision to be made by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney.But who are the favourites to\u0026nbspadorn\u0026nbspthe new £50 notes, and what have been their contributions to science and UK society?Many people’s favourite to win will undoubtedly be the recently deceased Hawking, a true scientific superstar whose contributions to science extended far beyond his own discipline.Particle physicist and TV presenter Professor Brian Cox expressed his support for Hawking on the new note,\u0026nbsptweeting: “He made invaluable contributions over half a century to our understanding of cosmology, the early universe and black holes.”Professor Cox added that the former Cambridge academic has inspired thousands of scientists and millions of people through his books and lectures, “me included”.Hawking gave his name to the radiation emitted by black holes, advanced studies of the universe’s origins\u0026nbspand penned the bestselling popular science book A Brief History of Time to transmit ideas from his discipline to more than 10 million readers.Franklin’s work as an X-ray crystallographer at King’s College London produced images that contributed to James Watson and Francis Crick’s identification of the DNA double helix.In the years following her death in 1958, her crucial work has been recognised by many including Watson and Crick themselves, but Franklin was not included in the Nobel Prize the duo went on to win four years later.Franklin’s story is now seen as a cautionary tale about the ways the contributions of women have been ignored over the course of scientific history.A place on the £50 note would be seen by many as a fantastic way to honour a scientist who was never given the recognition she deserved in her lifetime.Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, mentioned Franklin along with palaeontologist Mary Anning as potential faces for the new notes.“They were both underrecognised in their lifetime and now we could set the record straight and recognise the huge achievements they made,” she said.Another figure seen as an overlooked\u0026nbspscientific pioneer from a time when women were not traditionally included in science, Lovelace is often described as the world’s first computer programmer.The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a mathematician who worked on Charles Babbage’s proposed computer, the Analytical Engine.Lovelace translated an article by an Italian military engineer concerning the engine, adding an elaborate set of notes that contain what some have described as the first ever computer program – an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.Like Franklin, Lovelace has only recently been recognised for her contribution, and her addition to the new £50 would therefore be a fitting tribute for someone who was not recognised in their lifetime.In his role as a codebreaker during the Second World War, Turing played a major part in helping defeat Nazi Germany by providing the allied forces\u0026nbspwith information that gave them the upper hand in key operations.His work at Bletchley Park during the war cracked the German messages sent by the Enigma machine, and is regarded as making key contributions to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.Turing was convicted in 1952 under anti-homosexuality laws, leading to him accepting chemical castration and ultimately taking his own life two years later.Though he was posthumously pardoned in 2013, many will surely see a place on the currency as a way to honour his legacy.As the only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate, Hodgkin would be another perfect addition to the UK’s currency, and one who many people are perhaps not familiar with.The chemist won the prize in 1964 for her pioneering work that helped unravel the 3D structure of important substances such as insulin.Her nomination was backed by Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan, who said: “I would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel Prize.”“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.“She was also a remarkable inidual who championed science in developing countries.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

Six actors – Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale and Ben Whishaw among them – portrayed Dylan at different stages of his career as part of an appropriately freewheelin’ approach to narrative.To convince director Oliver Stone to give him the part of Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer undertook hours of extensive research into his hero, learning 50 songs to mimic his singing voice. When the surviving members of the Doors assembled to hear a recording of Kilmer, none could tell which was the impersonation and which the real Morrison. The Doors was not loved by all but the great Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan were memorable in supporting roles as keyboardist Ray Manzarek and Morrison\u0027s girlfriend Pamela Courson respectively. Gary Oldman was a dead-ringer for the late Sex Pistols guitarist Sid Vicious in director Alex Cox’s appropriately grotty account of the punk star’s pointless death from heroin following the overdose of his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) in New York’s Hotel Chelsea. Bandmate Johnny Rotten was predictably dismissive of the project but understandably annoyed that Joe Strummer of The Clash had been consulted but not him.410 7. Get on Up (2014)Like Rami Malek, Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman faced a seemingly impossible task in portraying soul superstar James Brown, “Mr Dynamite” himself. He acquitted himself well, however, in a film that largely conformed to genre formula but offered strength in depth with Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis, Lennie James and Octavia Spencer among the supporting cast.510 6. What’s Love Got to Do with It? (1993)Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne were superbly matched as Tina and Ike Turner in Brian Gibson’s unflinching account of their rise to fame and abusive marriage. Adapted from Tina’s memoir I, Tina, the movie follows Ike’s violent attempts to dominate her before a conversion to Buddhism gives the soul star the strength to break free and go it alone.Depicting the rise of game-changing LA rappers NWA in the late 1980s, Straight Outta Compton appeared in 2015 and was a smash hit, making $200m (£153m) at the box office on a $50m (£38m) budget. While F Gary Gray\u0027s film lost its way in its second half, becoming bogged down in contract disputes, overall it did a superb job of capturing the vitality and righteous anger of the album of the same name. O\u0027Shea Jackson Jr\u0027s performance as his own real-life father, Ice Cube, was a revelation.Jamie Foxx was ideally cast as Ray Charles in Taylor Hackford’s telling of the life of the blind soul star, charting his rise from poverty in rural Florida to worldwide acclaim. A sample of Foxx singing “I Got a Woman” provided the unlikely basis for Kanye West’s huge hit “Gold Digger” in 2005.810 3. Walk the Line (2005)James Mangold’s film, in which Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon excelled as Johnny Cash and June Carter, was a highly accomplished period piece and swept up its fair share of awards. Admittedly conventional - containing at least three eureka moments in which the leads are inspired to write their best known songs - this is solid and fair-minded stuff.Marion Cotillard became an international star and was named Best Actress at the Oscars for her incredibly emotional turn as tragic French chanteuse Edith Piaf in Olivier Dahan’s 2007 film. Covering the central events of her life from childhood to middle age, the biopic captured the defiant, uncompromising character of its subject, as expressed by her signature song “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien”.The directorial debut of Anton Corbijn, who had photographed Joy Division in their prime, Control married the British kitchen sink realism of the 1960s with the doom-laden atmosphere of Ingmar Bergman to appropriately eerie effect.

He said the “actual loan came from another one of my companies”.Asked repeatedly by Mr Marr\u0026nbspwhat the other company was, the businessman insisted the money had come only from Rock Services.\u0026nbspHe rejected the Electoral Commission’s suggestion that some of the money could have come\u0026nbspfrom Isle of Man-based company Rock Holdings, which owns Rock Services. This would be potentially illegal because, under UK law,\u0026nbspcampaign donations can only be made by firms\u0026nbspregistered in the UK.Mr Banks\u0026nbspsaid the probe into Leave.EU’s funding was “politically motivated” and came after pressure from “a group of vicious Labour MPs who have grouped together with  and the Financial Times to try to undermine Brexit”.The BBC’s decision to host\u0026nbspMr Banks on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspshow\u0026nbspprompted outrage from other political figures.In a typically aggressive performance, the Brexiteer\u0026nbsplashed out at DCMS\u0026nbspcommittee chairman Damian\u0026nbspCollins, who has\u0026nbspbeen highly critical of him.Asked why he had written to Mr Collins’ constituents in Folkestone and Hythe calling the MP a “snake in the grass”, Mr Banks replied: “Well, he is.”Claims have been made that Mr Banks misled\u0026nbspMr Collins’ committee\u0026nbspin relation to whether staff at another of his insurance companies had worked on the Leave.EU campaign.According to The Observer, leaked emails suggest\u0026nbspemployees of Eldon Insurance worked on the campaign without this being declared as official\u0026nbspspending.Mr Collins suggested the emails appeared to “flatly contradict” what Mr Banks had told his committee in June.\u0026nbspAsked about the matter, Mr Banks told Andrew\u0026nbspMarr: “That was reported to the Electoral Commission. People that\u0026nbspdid work from Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts\u0026nbsplegally and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Both these options will further depress investment,” the group said\u0026nbspin a letter.“They will be bad for business and bad for working people. Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People’s Vote.”The government’s Brexit department said it was confident of securing a deal that works for businesses, and reiterated its opposition to a second referendum.“The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen, and the prime minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,” a spokesman said.Additional reporting by ReutersThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

(LREM) party in a poll.The Ifop poll of voting intentions for the May 2019 European Parliament elections showed the RN rising from 17 per cent at the end of August to 21 per cent now, moving ahead of the LREM on 20 per cent for the first time.The RN’s 21\u0026nbspper cent, combined with the 7 per cent of Nicolas Dupont-Aignan’s Debout La France (Stand up France) party and one per cent each for Florian Philippot’s Les Patriotes and François Asselineau’s pro-“Frexit” Popular Republican Union gave far-right parties a combined 30 per cent total.Before our eyes, Italy is becoming a fascist stateThis was up five percentage points from 25 per cent of voting intentions at the end of August.\u0026nbspSunday’s poll provides striking evidence that France has shifted towards the far right since Macron easily beat Le Pen, leading what was then known as the\u0026nbspFront National, in the second round of voting in the 2017 French presidential election.It also gives further cause to believe that the European Parliament elections in 2019 are shaping up to be a major battle between centrist, pro-EU parties such as\u0026nbspMacron’s LREM, and far-right formations that want to stop immigration and globalisation.Created with Sketch.

Maybe in Europe, but not the Middle East.I will not stop this business because I am helping myself and other people.Viewers see Maher meet Paulina and Rita, two young women from Ghana who have travelled to the Lebanon to work.Maher says he likes to recruit Ghanaian women as they are harder workers.When the pair are forced to hand over their passports and phones, they are nervous.Paulina has a baby son, and worries about how she is going to contact her family without a mobile phone. Its a fear for me, she admits.The pair are also taken for medical checks, to ensure they are fit and well enough to put in the gruelling shts their employers will demand.“Sometimes a girl comes over from her country,she’s pregnant or she’s sick, this is a big problem,” says Maher.When the tests come back clear, the girls are placed with a family - and Maher gets his commission.

The Netherlands and Spain were the only other EU countries in the top ten.That is some achievement for the UK. And demonstrates that the people who know where to invest, know it should be in the UK.They know we live in a dynamic nation, brimming with potential.So as we leave the European Union, we should remember the many reasons investors choose to put their money here in the United Kingdom, which is one of the world’s largest and most successful economies.We are at record levels of employment. Our success is underpinned by a legal system whose reputation is second to none. We have a skilled workforce and a low tax and a well-regulated economy.We are home to some of the finest universities, our research and development capabilities are cutting-edge and our financial institutions world-leading.We are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the United States in the afternoon — and, of course, we speak English, the language of global business.Plus, there is serious global momentum behind businesses in the UK.

For example, we excel at research and development, which means that overseas companies want to tap into British expertise to advance the quality of their products. In last week’s Budget, we announced a further £.billion to strengthen the UK’s global leadership in science and innovation — that brings the total to £billion invested in research and development since .We want a partnership with business to make our country prosper.The Government’s Industrial Strategy includes innovative deals agreed with inidual sectors to attract investment.

She’s very strong – and we needed that strength.Gemmas devastated mum Helen Sproates paid tribute to her ‘angel’ daughter saying: My world will never be the same again.She added: She would genuinely help anybodyshe could, she was just like an angel.“Kate lost her own mum to liver cancer, so for her to put that on the back burner and support us must have been really hard as she’s still grieving herself.“I know she found it hard, but she did it anyway. That’s an amazing human being who can do something like that.”Kate visited Gemma in hospital during her final days, staying at her bedside.Speaking about her relationship with little girl Penelope, Helen told The Rossendale Free Press: They were so alike, very cheeky characters, like two peas in a pod and just watching them together was just beautul.

She fought her battle and against all odds she kept proving them wrong.“The fundraising had been a phenomenal success and Helen’s initial efforts to send Gemma to Germany for immunotherapy treatment hadn’t been in vain.

She was a kind and thoughtful daughter with a caring nature.“Most of all she loved her special little Penelope and was a fantastic mummy.  Penelope has been her rock and her reason to keep going as long as she did.“It is heartbreaking to know ­Penelope is now  having to grow up without her mummy’s love.”Gemma first learned she had aggressive oian cancer at her -week scan and was offered a termination so she could start le-saving treatment.But she chose to delay any treatment until after the birth of her daughter Penelope and after the birth doctors were able to remove the oian tumour.She began a gruelling round of chemotherapy while her baby battled for her le in intensive care.After initially beating the illness, Gemma said she enjoyed getting in to a routine and got a job as a trainee manager at her mum’s soft play business, Funtazia in Blackburn.But sadly, a year later, her cancer ed and after rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, doctors said little could be done to save her.Gemmas mum Helen had read about immunotherapy, which boosts the bodys natural defences, available at the Hallwang Clinic in Germany.The -year-old sold her house and started a fundraising page to raise further donations to cover the cost of the huge cost of the therapy.Gemma flew to Germany last May and began a six-session course, which costs up to £, a time, but only had enough funds for the first round.In July, Helen received an email from Kate Winslets PA saying she wanted to offer her support and had contacted her Titanic co-star Leonardo Di Caprio for help.The pair auctioned themselves off for three dates at DiCaprios annual fundraising event and raised . million , which they were able to also give to other charities.Gemma got the all-clear at the start of this year and in February appeared on This Morning to revisit the amazing moment the -year-old actress offered to help pay for her treatment.Hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield then surprised the brave mum as they revealed the Hollywood star was on the other end of the phone.Winslet said: I lost my own mother last year in May to oian cancer and we as a family were given a very poor prognosis for my mum.After a four year battle... we decided to look where and we also stumbled across those places in Germany.Simultaneously I came across [Gemmas] petition campaigning to have immunotherapy made available on the NHS and my heart sunk as at that point.I thought this poor young woman is probably years away from her being able to access that kind of treatment on the national health service.I found her Go Fund Me page and I saw how much she needed to raise and at that point there was only £, in the fund and I just thought I cannot have this happen.My own mother was very, very, very unwell and I just though my mum would be very gratefulI could do this for someone , another young mum.We got close to £, and I thought, right its time to call my friend Leo.I phoned Leo and I said do you think that we could do a charity dinner or something and he said lets go one better, come with me to Saint Tropez to my benefit fundraiser and we will auction off a dinner with Jack and Rose.Gemma had viewers in tears as she told the actress: Thank you so much for all your hard work and me being able to have my treatment that I really did need.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing.All  passengers and  crew on board the Boeing  are missing, presumed dead.Vance told the Daily Star: The passengers ended up in the Southern Indian Ocean, and are at the bottom of the sea inside the sunken and intact fuselage.The Canadian-born investigator slammed the official investigation and expressed regret about how authorities in Malaysia hadnt gone back to the Southern Indian Ocean to follow his advice.He went on: I honestly believed that once the official investigation team saw the physical evidence that we discovered, and how we interpreted it accurately, they would change their minds about what they thought happened to MH.Unfortunately, and disappointingly, I was wrong.I am not sure why they continue to cling to their incorrect theories and analysis.He also dismissed the theory of Ian Wilson, an amateur investigator who claimed to have found the missing plane in the middle of the Cambodian jungle on Google Maps.Vance said there was no way the plane could have survived a crash into the jungle intact.Images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.But video producer Ian is convinced of his findings and says he  intends to visit the sight to solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.He told the Daily Star:

Bronagh and Callum wreaked havoc earlier in the year.Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Channel, said: Four more named Atlantic storms are expected by early December, plus the risk of a fth named storm before Christmas.Travel disruption and wind gusts over mph in parts of the North and West are expected.Tomorrow will be a largely dry day with some patches of rain across

The -year-old and -year-old boys were gunned down outside a family members home in Birmingham on Friday night as they attended a childrens Halloween party. The boys knocked on the door of the house around .pm and as they waited for someone to open it they were shot at by the gunman. A bullet pierced the -year-old chest - narrowly missing his vital organs. It then lodged in the stomach of his -year-old friend. Distraught relatives opened the door to find the two boys bleeding in a heap on the ground.  Both remain in hospital in a serious but stable condition. The younger boy underwent surgery to have the bullet removed from his stomach on Saturday. Detectives are carrying out round the clock enquiries to find whoever fired the gun which includes extensive CCTV analysis being carried within the area. The shot is believed to have come from someone in a car who then fled the scene.  West Midlands Police, Detective Superintendent Maria Fox said: We as a police force, and the community as a whole, are absolutely shocked, appalled and outraged that two children have been shot at and seriously injured. All gun crime is completely unacceptable but the fact that two teenage boys, who were just out and about enjoying the festivities have suffered pain at the hands of a weapon is even more galling. There can be no excuse or justication to shoot towards young people and it makes us all the more determined to catch the coward who did this. I can assure everyone that we wont stop until we bring them to justice. We have a number of active lines of enquiry but at this stage we dont believe the boys were deliberately targeted. But that is no solace for them as they recover from their injuries and psychological torment this will have undoubtedly brought.  I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a car behaving suspiciously between around -.am maybe driving slowly or repeatedly seen in the area. We believe there were a lot of other vehicles in the area at the time and we need those drivers to come forward - especiallythey have dash cam footage. No arrests have been made and police are trying to establish a motive and trace the gunman.

Norman Yeo first abused her in her bedroom when she was eight. He started off by showing her pictures of naked women in a porn magazine and telling her she “would be like that soon”. The paedophile moved on to touching and raping her. He carried on until Caryn was  – but more than two decades went by before he was finally brought to justice. Caryn only plucked up the courage to tell police after her older sister Jenny died suddenly aged just  without seeing their vile dad caged for his crimes. Yeo was eventually jailed for  years and Caryn has told the sisters’ horric story in a heartbreaking memoir entitled Tell Me You’re Sorry, Daddy.  She said: “Our childhoods were just awful but the sad thing is, I thought the way we lived was normal. “No one ever told me they loved me, or read me a bedtime story. I was in my twenties before anyone gave me a hug. “I hated every second of what my dad did to me. I was so little and it was so painful but he lied and told me all dads did this to their daughters. “I never thought I’d find the courage to go to the police. I assumed these shyterrible things must somehow be my fault. I’m speaking out for Jenny. “She always said she wanted to write a book about what happened to us but now it’s up to me.” Jenny had been taken into care aged  months after social workers found her severely underweight and covered in bruises. The authorities suspected Yeo and his we Lesley of harming Jenny – but, amazingly, left Caryn in their clutches in Wallasey, Merseyside – a decision she questions every day.  Caryn said: “Why didn’t they take me, too  They obviously knew my parents were not nice people. “We lived in complete fear of upsetting them. I don’t have any happy memories of my childhood. “I only realised this wasn’t normal when I went to a friend’s house after school and her family were smiling and laughing together and her mum was baking cakes. “Her house felt so safe, but we were never safe. We were always on edge.” Caryn was eight when Yeo first crept into her room in the dead of night. She said: “It wasn’t long before he started trying to rape me. Eventually, he succeeded.It would happen night after night, but there was nothing I could do. “I would just lie on my bed, covered in blood, praying for it to stop. “I tried to barricade my door to stop him from getting into my room but he always found a way.”  The sexual abuse only ended when Yeo left the family home, shortly after Caryn turned , but the mental scars remained. Aged , she fell pregnant with her only son Karl, now , to an older boyfriend. She said: “I’d never felt love like I felt for my baby, as I held his hand in his little glass cot. I whispered, ‘I don’t know how to love you, but I am going to learn’. “I was so nervous, as no one had ever shown me any love, but I was determined to protect him. Yet it made me so sad that no one had felt that way about me when I was a baby.” As adults, she and Jenny tried to forge the sisterly bond they’d missed out on as children. Jenny had spent her childhood being shunted between foster carers and children’s homes, only shyseeing Caryn when she was allowed home for visits. Caryn said: “We got on well but we didn’t have that natural connection that sisters who have been brought up together have. “It was painful for us to talk about what had happened. Jenny told me that when she’d got her first flat, aged , Dad would come round constantly, demanding sex. “To him, his daughters were just something to be used.”  The sisters had finally become close when Jenny died of a brain aneurysm aged . Caryn said: “My mum called to tell me but there was no emotion in her voice. I was distraught.” For the next four years, Caryn lived in limbo, scared she couldn’t find the strength to report her dad. But a chance meeting with him in  at her gran’s nursing home spurred her into action. She said: “I hadn’t seen him for years but I suddenly became paralysed by fear that he might have access to kids. “I drove to the police station three times before I plucked up the courage to go in. They took me straight into a private room and I gave a -page statement. “It was surreal but I spoke to Jenny in my head a lot, asking her to help me through. “Dad was arrested and tried to kill himself. “But he wouldn’t admit everything he’d done to me so I was told I’d have to give evidence against him in court.” Caryn suffered months of nightmares and flashbacks but refused to back down – convinced Jenny was looking down on her. She said: “Throughout the process, I kept seeing magpies everywhere and I became convinced it was Jenny’s way of telling me she was with me. “The day I took the stand, there was one just outside my house. I really feel like she was with me.” Yeo, then , was found guilty by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court of eight shyoffences of rape and five of indecent assault. He had admitted  charges of indecent assault. Jailing him for  years, Judge John Phipps said: “This case concerns regular, repeated systematic abuse.” Caryn, who went to court to see her dad sentenced in , said: “It was so important for me to hear that, to have someone say it wasn’t my fault.” Yeo is eligible for parole next summer.But Caryn said: “For me, forgiveness is a strange word. I don’t believe what my dad did was OK, but I have been able to let go. “I’m not angry any more because my anger will only hurt me. I’m just glad I’ve finally been able to give Jenny the voice she never had. “I wish she could see how much I’ve grown. I’m no longer a scared little girl. I’m speaking out for both of us.”Tell Me You’re Sorry, Daddy, by Caryn Walker with Linda Watson-Brown, is out now, published by John Blake at pound..

Steff Barnett, , who was born Steve, knew for many years she was a gay woman trapped in a man’s body. But she only started the process of changing gender after the couple’s two sons had left home. And despite the problems it has posed, nurse Lynne, , decided to remain with the person she married. They no longer have an intimate physical side to their relationship but say they are still happy together.  Radio presenter Steff said: “Lynne misses her husband desperately... “The guilt was horric. I felt as though I’d let Lynne down. I love her passionately even now. “She’s stayed by me, she was brave enough to do that, even though she’s just about lost her husband. “There’s this huge love thing going on between us. It’s almost a meshed soul but something is twisting it, trying to pull it apart.” Lynne said: “When he started to transition I knew there was no turning back. “But I loved Steve enough to know this was the only way forward.” She added that as far as she is concerned they will always stay married. The pair, from Bradley Stoke, Bristol, met in a pub in  when Lynne was , and they watched Hollywood movie Shaft on their first date.  But Lynne was not initially convinced by her suitor – leading to several awkward months. She said: “He would come to my house and I would hide in the back room and my mum would go absolutely crazy. She would say ‘he’s come round to see you, you have to go. I’m not going to tell him you’re not in’.” The pair soon saw past their dferences and married within a year of those first dates. Two weeks later the husband had a confession for Lynne – he enjoyed wearing women’s clothes. Steff said: “I couldn’t use the term gender dysphoria because I had no clue what that was. “But neither of us knew the consequences of what was coming.”  Lynne added: “It wasn’t once said ‘I think I’ve been born in the wrong body’. We thought it was a sexual thing [he was] going through. “It didn’t bother me he wanted to put on stockings or suspenders or a skirt. I didn’t even think about it because it wasn’t something that was done all the time.” Apart from Lynne knowing, Steff kept it a secret about wearing women’s clothes for decades. The couple had two children and Steff feared living openly as a woman while their sons were young because of concerns over playground bullying. She said: “We knew how cruel schoolkids could be andI had transitioned when I was younger it would have wrecked their lives I’m sure. “Every waking moment I had to suppress this feeling of ‘I’m not me’... I’m not me’. “My thoughts and my feelings were dragging at me constantly.”  In  Steff decided the time was right to think about transitioning. She said: “We had three years of talking and talking to try and sort the issue. I don’t think I would be hereI didn’t transition. “So Valentine’s Day when I went in I had surgery I walked out with Lynne and I just whooped for joy. “I took my first breath outside... It was a very emotional moment.” But Steff admits things are not perfect. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “I miss the intimacy. I really do. But Lynne can’t make that leap. “Lynne had to go through the loss of her husband and then after that I had to go through the loss of my we.” Lynne misses having a man’s arms around her.  The mum said: “Steff is gay, she’s liked women, she’s always liked women. I’ve always been  per cent heterosexual. I miss him [Steve] every day. “To have a man’s hands around you, kissing you, protecting you. “I’m not in her head to understand to see how she thinks. And she’s not in my head to feel what I’ve lost.  “She is a very tactile person who likes to be cuddled and kissed and hug and hold hands and I can’t do that. I just can’t do it.” Lynne added: “She says ‘well you can cuddle your friends when you’re down’ but my friends have always been in that female form... They weren’t my husband to start with.” Since transitioning, Steff has become a presenter at BCfm Radio, hosting a weekly show on Fridays.  Steff said: “I am so, so happy. It was always a dream to get into radio. That didn’t happen until I transitioned. I am much more confident. “And I’m probably the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire le. And I’m now me. “We still love each other. And I guess that’s what got us through this.” Lynne said: “There have been other people in my le but there isn’t anyone that I would want to be with more than I want to be with Steff.  “Our marriage certicate still says Steve Barnett and Lynne Hogan and as far as I’m concerned that is a sacred piece of paper to me and that’s how it will always be. “We’ve had a hell of a journey. Ups and downs, good and bad and I just can’t see us just not being together. “You just count your blessings and think that things could be so much worse. I’m one of the lucky ones.”The couple told their story to BBC Inside Out West.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

Its a huge honour to Doria as its extremely rare for the Queen to invite a non-royal to join them, and its never been extended to Kates family. A source told the Sunday Express: Its a mark of the Queens respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesnt have any other relations in this country - unlike Kate who has the support of a very close family.  In previous years the Middletons have joined the Royals for church in the morning, but they were always based at Kate and Williams Anmer Hall home rather than on the royal estate. Doria has reportedly impressed the Queen with the dignity she has shown while other members of Meghans family have cashed in on her new royal status.

She helped set up a charity cookbook in aid of a community kitchen which supports the community affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy.

All that pensioners Paul Attwater and Iris wanted was some extra cash to pay for a Crawley Town FC season ticket and a few holidays in the sun. But shocked Paul, , and Iris, , were hauled into court after being accused of helping a rogue state develop weapons of mass destruction. Far from being sophisticated arms shydealers, the grandparents were selling nuts and bolts to an Iraqi-born businessman in Malaysia. Instead of engaging in espionage, they were counting screws on the living room floor of their pound, end of terrace and storing aircraft parts in their attic.  They were stunned when investigators told them the hardware was being shipped on to Iran where it could be used by the rogue nation in a nuclear weapons shydevelopment programme. A judge spared them jail this week after saying they were “very, very naive” and had been deceived by the businessman. But the couple – despite losing pound, in the business venture and being owed pound, – fear they will lose their home as prosecutors aim to seize their assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Former secretary Iris said: “It’s been an absolute nightmare. We’ve been made out to be international arms dealers but nothing could be further from the truth. “It’s nothing like they were saying – it wasn’t weapons. We were literally counting , nuts and bolts on the living room floor.” Iris, who along with Paul are diehard fans of League Two side Crawley Town, added: “We were just wanting to make a bit of money to pay for the football and go on holiday.  “Now I’m petried that I might lose my house. The whole thing has made me ill.” The couple were duped by businessman Alexander George, , and were unaware he was using a complex network of companies in the Far East and a Dutch shipping firm to send the parts on to Iran. Iris said: “We were friends with Alex. He would always be overly friendly and tell us we were like family. “We would meet up for drinks and shydinner and pay for everything, we just thought he was a kind person. “But we haven’t spoken to him since this happened, we had no idea what he was doing. He’s a very good liar. “We’ll never have anything to do with him again. We are absolutely gutted. Our whole reputations have been ruined.” Paul, who has  grandchildren, told the Sunday People: “When we were interviewed and they told me the parts could have been going to Iran, I thought it was a joke. I had no idea whatsoever that these parts were going there. I didn’t even believe they were for military use. ” Paul and Iris ran a little company called Pairs Aviation from their pound, home in the Bewbush neighbourhood of Crawley, West Sussex.  Their dining room table was strewn with paperwork as they transformed the five-bedroom home into a makesht office. Prosecutors said the couple were warned in  that the parts they were sending to Malaysia required a licence. But Paul and Iris, who now live in Telford, Shrops, say a Dutch shipping firm told them they could continue to send the supplies. And they say they told Customs officials exactly what they were doing during an audit in . Iris said: “We’ve never tried to hide anything. “Paul is as straight as anything. He’s completely black and white, he’s just not like that. He would not have done something wrong intentionally. I trust him explicitly. “This has ruined our lives. Our friends and shyfamily know we’re not the people we’ve been made out to be. But it’s been hard. “It’s not like we were making vast sums of money. In the last two years we lost pound, each year. “We made decent money on paper but it all went back on paying for parts.  “And some of the companies abroad still owe us in excess of , dollars.” Paul pleaded guilty at London’s Southwark Crown Court to being shyknowingly concerned in the exportation of goods with intent to evade shyprohibition or restriction. He agreed to sign a basis of plea before his shyformal guilty plea, in which he said: “I did not know or believe that goods or aircraft components would be shipped to Iran.” Iris denied the same charge but was convicted by a jury. They were both given a six-month suspended jail sentence and barred from being company directors for six years. Judge Michael Grieve QC said: “The fact that you were, in effect, groomed by Mr George I accept. “He deceived you. I do not for one moment think either of you are bad people. You have, in my view, been very, very naive.” The couple’s barrister, George Hepburne-Scott, said: “These two very decent honourable people were groomed and deceived by a sophisticated offender with a global web of companies. “They now have a criminal conviction and are facing losing their house. They completely trusted this man and they were totally duped by him.” George, of Bristol, was found guilty of being knowingly shyconcerned in the supply or delivery of controlled goods to an embargoed destination. He will be sentenced next month.

I was getting really emotional.  “I thought I was going to fall over. And then I started running – that was a mistake. I was really wobbly. “It feels a bit weird. Feels a bit too solid for my liking.” He left Margate on June  and then circumnavigated Britain by front crawl in a clockwise direction. He had expected it to take  days and told his family “sorry I’m late” as they greeted him alongside hundreds of others on the beach. During his epic feat, Ross’s tongue started to disintegrate due to the exposure to salt water and he was also stung in the face by a jellyfish. Ross, from Grantham, Lincs, swam for to  hours a day, on occasions through the night. He battled strong tides and currents in cold water, storms, and swimming into winter, suffering shoulder pain and wetsuit chafing. He was Ross Edgley, , has front-crawled almost , miles over  days to become first person to swim round UK .  Ross’s odyssey has been compared to that of Captain Matthew Webb, who in  became the first person to swim the English Channel. While more than , swimmers have since made that crossing, few are likely to follow in Ross’s wake. He was thrilled by his reception early yesterday morning. He said: “That was unbelievable. You won’t find many other sports where people will come out in November, at five o’clock in the morning, just to swim out for a mile. “That represented what I love about open water swimming. “Because I’ve had my face in the water for so long now I didn’t know – I thought it was just going to be my mum and my dad with a pizza.” He entered the Guinness Book of World Records on August , on day , for the longest staged sea swim. It is his latest record-breaking feat. In , he did a rope climb equivalent to the height of Mount Everest in  hours, two months after doing a marathon pulling a car. And his mantra on challenges  “Be naive enough to start and stubborn enough to finish.” "},{"url":null,"title":"saira khan forgiveness always triumph","story":"NewsopinionSaira Khan: Why forgiveness will always triumph over hatredEverywhere you look people are spouting vitriol at one another for their faith, their gender, their ­sexuality, even their food choices!ShareCommentsBySaira Khan:,  NOV NewsopinionSaira Khan and Laura Pradelska\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHow is it that in a world so full of hate, the very shyiniduals who might be forgiven for embracing it are so often shining examples of tolerance and understanding  Everywhere you look people are spouting vitriol at one another for their faith, their gender, their shysexuality, even their food choices! And all it does is stoke the fires of enmity and raise the emotional temperature until you end up with a white supremacist gunning down  elderly Jewish people in a synagogue or a police investigation into alleged anti-Semitic social media posts by Labour Party members. So when I was asked to host this week’s  Winter Gala by shyQuilliam, the anti-extremism think tank, I knew it was going to be a worthwhile and important evening. As the Moslem child of Pakistani immigrant parents, I felt it was my duty to do my bit, as did my lovely co-host, the Jewish Game of Thrones actress Laura Pradelska, whose grandparents survived the Holocaust. What I hadn’t expected was quite how heart-warming it would be.  Because what we witnessed from the people we honoured that night was the opposite of hatred – it was courage, understanding and kindness against all the odds. The two people I can’t get out of my head – or my heart – were -year-old Ahmad Nawaz and -year old Mindu Hornick.When Ahmad was just  years old Taliban terrorists attacked his school in the Pakistani city of Peshawar. His little brother and  other children were gunned down. Ahmad was shot himself and only survived by playing dead. He was flown to Birmingham for surgery that saved his arm from amputation, and now he tours schools in the West Midlands, telling his story to pupils at risk of radicalisation. When Mindu was  she was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp.She and her sister escaped the gas chamber by pretending to be older, and claiming they were skilled tailors.The rest of her family died.  Now she too tours schools telling her story as a living warning of the dangers of prejudice and extremism. As I listened to these two extraordinary human beings, I thought thatanyone had the right to hate, it would be them.The trauma and loss they both suffered is beyond imagining.But there they were, side by side, the young Muslim lad and the elderly Jewish death camp survivor, working together to promote inter-faith relations andto help survivors of violent extremism in the UK. And these are the voices we need to listen to.The extremists may have used social media to ide communities and spread their evil rhetoric, but while people like Ahmad and Mindu endure, their message of respect gives us cause to hope. We should all listen to them, and reject the easy stereotypes peddled by the fear-mongers. If human nature were about focusing on what ides us we’d still be living in caves. I choose to believe that the American Muslims who raised , for the Jewish victims of the Pittsburgh race hate shooting are a much better example. An example we all need to followwe want to turn back this tide of hate.

The -year-old mum-of-five was last seen in the Bazes Shaw area of New Ash Green, in Kent, on the evening of October . She was reported missing two days later. As concerns for her welfare grew hundreds of people volunteered to join the search party and the police issued a renewed appeal. Last week black and white images taken from a CCTV camera came to light.  They appear to show a car parked on the bank of the Thames and a hooded man, who spends eight minutes in the area, leaving the car twice to walk towards the river. Having left the vehicle and walked towards a wall running along the riverbank, the man s to his car after less than a minute. A minute later, he exits the vehicle again and heads towards the river and out of the camera range. Two minutes later he reemerges and drives off. The footage, which was filmed five days after the beautician was last seen, was enough to prompt police ers to scour mudflats yards from where the hooded man stood. On Thursday officers from Kent Polices search and marine unit spent hours wading through the heavy mud as a drone flew overhead.  About  detectives are working on the case and have so far taken more than  witness statements. As well as searching parts of the Thames near Greenhithe, officers have been seen scouring Dartford town centre. Officers with snfer dogs have also searched an area close to Scratchers Lane, in nearby Fawkham. More than , hours of CCTV footage have been sent to police as part of the investigation. On Friday officers raided the house Ms Wellgreen shared with her ex-boyfriend Ben Lacomba for a second time.  The -year-old taxi driver left the property in New Ash Green while the search was ongoing and drove away. Some time later the officers left with several evidence bags. The house was first searched on October  when Mr Lacomba, who has three young children with Ms Wellgreen, was arrested in connection with the investigation. He was released three days later and is on bail until November . Police have said the case is a ‘potential murder inquiry’. On Friday Kent Police reissued its appeal for any CCTV and dashcam footage taken within a five-mile radius of New Ash Green on the night of  to  October.

Student Rachel Holmes claims she keeps finding human POO on her Renault Clio - and it is every bit as stomach-churning as it sounds. It has already happened twice in  days, and she is now desperately trying to track down the mystery poo bandit before it happens again. Rachel, , who goes to Swansea University, usually parks her car in a small cul-de-sac behind her house in King Edwards Road in the Brynmill area of Swansea. She said: I am convinced its going to happen again. I have no idea who is doing it - not many people know I have a car.  I do not knowits a personal thing or not - I am just confused. We have no problems with our neighbours and the car was parked in a dferent place each time I do not knowit is drunken vandalism. Adding to the disgusting mystery, she has been unable to find any scratches or marks on the vehicle. This suggests it was not freshly produced.  Rachel, who is in her fourth year studying English and French, had to enlist the help of her friends to help her clean it up the first time. The first one was a bit runny at the beginning and it had hardened, so me and my friends had to chisel it off the windscreen. Then it didnt come off until it chucked down with rain. The second one was huge. That person does need to see a doctor but it was more fibrous so we could just chuck it on the floor.  She now checks her car everyday, evenshe does not need to use it. She has been considering putting a camera in her car, but fears the vile bandits will steal that instead of of pooing over her windscreen. Ms Holmes’ story has already attracted a lot of attention in the area, with some people suggesting that she take the poo to the police for DNA testing.

The teenager was among five boys who targeted Janice as she sat on a park bench in Suffolk in what a court heard was a despicable attack.An image showing them smiling and pointing at their cowering victim sparked widespread revulsion after being posted on Snapchat and Facebook. Until this week, the boys - all between  and  years old at the time - had had their identities protected because of their age. But Semple turned  last week, meaning he could be unmasked for the first time. Speaking out yesterday, the teenager - who pleaded guilty to threatening behaviour - described how he has received death threats from strangers.He told Sun Online: I’m struggling to leave the house at the moment. Since those pictures have gone on Facebook, I’ve had death threats from random people. Askedhe wanted to apologise for the attack in Bury St Edmunds, he reportedly said he was not ready because of the death threats sent to him online.Semple and his friends faced online abuse and direct threats from people who were sickened by the picture after it was shared online. Yesterday, presiding magistrate Simon Islett told the younger members of the group they could have faced jail termsthey were a few years older. He described the incident as a despicable attack on a vulnerable woman and said it was “terrying” for the mum-of-one.Mr Islett told one boy: “She didn’t know what was going to happen or what the outcome was going to be.  You have got to put yourself in the victim’s place and consider your actions and the effect it might have on them.” Janice was sitting in a park when she was approached by Semple and the group. Ipswich Youth Court heard they began asking questions about drugs before one of the boys spat in her face. Prosecutor Wayne Ablett said: He came from behind the bench and spat at her, with spit landing on her face. She said, What did you do that for  She recalls the boy laughing at her, then spitting at her again. Magistrates heard the group disappeared for around  minutes, then ed with flour bought at a nearby shop. Mr Ablett said: These items were chucked at and thrown at her body, covering her completely in flour. The boys were still laughing. She was spat at again and one of them had taken a photo of her. She heard one of them say, Were filming it.  The boys were arrested after the incriminating photo appeared on Facebook in July this year. Janice suffered no physical injuries but was left severely distressed by her ordeal. Semple, who admitted threatening behaviour, lives in Bury St Edmunds with his mum. The court heard since the incident he had received death threats, and felt remorseful and sorry for what happened. Declan Gallagher, defending Semple, said: He took the photograph and put it on his own Snapchat. One of his circle then took a screenshot of that, then it went onto Facebook, then it went beyond. He was released on bail, to be sentenced at an adult court on December . Four other boys, aged , ,  and , admitted the same offence yesterday and were sentenced to -month referral orders. They were also ordered to pay pound each in compensation to the victim. A sixth defendant, aged , denied using threatening behaviour and will face trial at the youth court on February .

The window had also been blocked with a mattress and there were no lights. Ellie-Mays mum Lauren Coyle, , and her boyfriend Reece Hitchcott, , were cleared of manslaughter, the Liverpool Echo reported. After almost seven-and-a-half hours of deliberations, the jury found the pair guilty of causing or allowing her death, one count of child cruelty by caging the child in her bed, and another count of child cruelty by restraining her in the bed.  Their lodger, Connor Kirby, , of Liverpool, was found not guilty of all of the charges A post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Alison Armour, a Home Office consultant forensic pathologist, concluded the childs death was caused by forcible restraint by ligatures in a face-down position complicated by hyperthermia. During the trial, prosecutor Christopher Tehrani, QC, read out a series of text messages between Coyle and Hitchcott, which between the couple following Ellie-Mays birth. Hitchcott sent a message which read: I will get it dont worry why the f*** have been like this today i have done f*** all wrong.  Coyle replied: Dont treat me like that bloody let you borrow pound when that could have gone on Ellies trainers. Hitchcott replied: Alright for you to be like that with me wtf Coyle replied: Cant be arsed with it anymore you owe money now pay it. Coyle soon began to complain to her boyfriend that Ellie-May was keeping her awake at night. Her text read: Ellie keeps waking up have to take in living room dont want to go to bed yet. Coyle often messaged her boyfriend while he was at work, the court heard.  On one occasion Hitchcott sent her a message which read: I love you baby this one of the ways it will teach her slowly that she needs to sleep on her own. On February   Coyle posted a message on her Facebook page which read: Finally got my little princess in a routine in her big bed. She is growing up far too fast. Coyle sent a message to Hitchcott which read: Stressed with Ellie. She was biting me so I put her in her room. She is banging her head off the walls. I have smacked her loads too. Hitchcott replied: I will sort her out when I come home. I will put her in her room. Coyle replied: I literally feel like jumping n front of a train. So stressed.  Hitchcott replied: I will sort it out baby. On another occasion Coyle sent a text to her boyfriend which read: There she goes ahead banging her f***ing head again. On March  Coyle sent a message to Hitchcott which read: Ellie playing up again shoved her in her room. Hitchcott replied: She will behave when I am home ha ha. Mr Tehrani also told the court that Ellie-Mays medical condition deteriorated in the months leading up to her death. The toddler suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, and a doctor said that she was suffering from gastroenteritis. The case was adjourned for sentencing at a later date.

Originally constructed in , the buildings first le was as a toll house, collecting fees from those heading west towards the coast, The Bristol Post reported.  It is said a money pouch used to hang on a hook over the front door, into which coach drivers would drop their fares as they passed freely along the road. But by , The Round House was already a residential dwelling. Village folk say a family of eight once lived within its small confines, with bunk beds built amid the roof rafters. The exposed beams remain today – but it still takes some imagination to see how eight people once fit. The hexagonal internal accommodation of the Round House includes an open plan kitchen and living area as well a modern shower room on the ground floor.  A narrow twisting staircase leads to a double bedroom which has a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams, and enjoys a lovely countryside aspect. Chapel shaped windows with shutters, an arched entrance door and an out of service post box all add to the charm of the property.

While the actual plot of land is effectively a patch of grass between roads, the unspoilt countryside at the heart of the Chew Valley would be on your doorstep.  The Round House fits well within Stanton Drew, which has a range of listed buildings dating from the th to th centuries as well as a primary school, pub, church and village hall.

Presley and Elias Trejo, from Fort Worth, Texas, welcomed baby girl Emerson Faye on July  but she passed away less than two weeks later after contracting the Herpes Simplex Virus after someone gave her a kiss. Mum Presley took to Facebook to warn others about what can happen when people kiss babies that arent their own.The emotional post, which has been shared more than , times, told of how baby Emerson Faye died after receiving the kiss of death as the virus is particularly harmful to babies because of their weak immune system.  She wrote: Emerson ended up passing away from what is called the HSV- virus. It’s the Herpes Simplex Virus most commonly known as the cold sore virus or the kiss of death for infants. For adults it’s not a big deal. But for infants with little to no immune system, it’s fatal. When someone who has the virus in their system and kisses an infant it can spread rapidly. You can have the virus and not even know you have it. You don’t have to have an active cold sore to pass it on. Presley, who is also mum to two boys, went on to describe how the disease slowly attacked her daughters body. She continued: You shed the virus in your saliva and when it gets on the baby it goes through the body so fast. It attacks the brain first.  It shows up as a type of meningitis. It’s fluid based around the vertebrae and goes straight the the brain. It then spreads to all their organs. It happens so fast that you don’t even know the baby is sick. In Emerson’s case, when we arrive to the hospital, her liver was completely gone. Her kidneys were right behind. Everything was failing. She was having multiple seizures until she was brain dead. Her heart stopped beating and the only thing that kept her alive were machines. My daughter, my own flesh and blood who I created out of love, was on le support and I had to be the one to pull the plug on her le. A mother should never ever have to bury their child. The virus took her at just  days old and we watched her die a very slow death. And now I have a letime without her. Presley then delivered a stark warning to others and said she decided to share her story in order to raise awareness. She added: Everyone needs to know about this virus and what it does to children and their families! PEOPLE!!!! STOP KISSING BABIES THAT ARE NOT YOURS!!!!! WAS YOUR HANDS WHEN YOU ARE AROUND NEWBORNS!!!!! I have seen stories about other infants passing from this same virus but you never think it’s going to happen to you. Well this time, it did. My babies don’t have their sister and my husband and I lost our only little girl.  Doctors don’t see this very often. There’s not a lot of cases on this but it’s starting to sp and more. And now it happened right here to us. Our perfectly healthy, happy, BEAUTIFUL angel is no longer here with us because of a terrible virus that people need to be more aware of. People need to know about this sickness. This is a serious and dangerous illness. Do your part, stop kissing babies and start washing your hands. These babies don’t deserve it. Emerson didn’t deserve it. I, as a mother and we, didn’t deserve it. My husband and kids don’t deserve it. And now we will live a whole le time of what ’s. I will never see her go to kindergarten, graduate high school or college, my husband will never walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, I will never see her be a better mother than me. It’s not fair!! We should have never had to go through this. I love you Emerson Faye. I will carry on your name and your love till eternity. I will never forget you. I will never stop loving you.

The news of the birth, which emerged in September, was followed by claims last month that fish and other forms of le are quickly filling up Dead Sea sinkholes.Hebrew prophet Ezekiel’s end-of-days prophecy foresees the sea - a hypersaline environment, with a reported  per cent salinity - flourishing into le. And a photojournalist with the Dead Sea Revival Project said that coming to the body of water, the lowest point on earth, you see prophecy coming true.  The third strange occurrence took place this week, when a snake was filmed slithering out of Israels Western Wall, unexpectedly interrupting prayers. Footage showed the reptile scaring away a pigeon - with some Internet users deeming it a sign that a prophecy about the Messiahs coming will soon be fulfilled.While countless end of the world conspiracy theories have fallen flat over the decades, some claim that the beginning of the end will actually begin in .The trio of signs have all emerged in the past few months. Below are the happenings that have sparked prophecy fulfilment claims  Birth of first red heer in  yearsTwo months ago, it emerged that a red heer had been born in Israel.The Temple Institute announced the birth via YouTube, and said the calf and her mother would undergo extensive examination to determineshes blemish free. It said the red calf brings the promise of reinstating Biblical purity to the world. Red heers feature in end of times tales, with the birth and sacrice of the red cow said to precede the construction of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. In mainstream Orthodox Judaism, the rebuilding of the Temple will happen before the coming of the Jewish Messiah. The two previous temples have been destroyed.  The Temple Institute and other organisations have been established with the goal of building the Third Temple on Mount Moriah or the Temple Mount. However, some theologians believe the construction of the Third Temple is linked to Judgement Day or the end of times. After “extensive examination of the calf, rabbinical experts are said to have confirmed she is a “viable candidate for the Biblical red heer”. Breaking Israel News reported a board of rabbis veried she fulfilled the requirements of the prophecy - which says the cow must be red without blemish. Fish spotted in the Dead Sea It is said that the Dead Seas high salinity prevents fish from living in it.However, marine le has reportedly been spotted in the seas sinkholes.Scientists are said to have been shocked to discover the sinkholes rapidly filling up with fish and other forms of le that never used to be sighted.Israeli photojournalist Noam Bedein said the body of water is anything but dead, telling Breaking Israel News that it is the “eighth wonder of the world.”  He has reportedly seen fish in the sinkholes - and witnessed growing vegetation. Ezekiel, a priest and prophet who appears in the Old Testament, foresaw the Dead Sea flourishing into le in his end-of-times prophecy.According to Ezekiel : -, there shall be a very great multitude of fish. And Mr Bedein said: A place that was once cursed in Biblical times, now you can come here to the Dead Sea, explore the sinkholes and see fish where the water has receded – fulfilling prophecies from Ezekiel who talked about the land flourishing and blooming when the Jews .  Snake wriggles out of the Western Wall A snake was spotted crawling out of the stones of Israels Western Wall on Wednesday night, causing some panic among worshippers. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation released video footage of the reptile emerging from one of Judaisms holiest sites, the Times of Israel reports.During the incident, the snake reportedly scared away a pigeon - which some bloggers have claimed is a symbol that we are living in dangerous times.They say these times lead up to the coming of the Messiah.  Some Internet users have also drawn connections to the serpent that tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, according to the Bible.According to Ynet news site, the snake that slithered out of the walls stones was likely trying to fatten itself up for the winter months. The incident came just months after a -pound boulder dislodged and fell from the Western Wall, nearly crushing a female worshipper below."},{"url":null,"title":"how many exes you you","story":"News\"How many exes have you had you slut \" Dads remark to fiancée hours before she stabbed him to deathDavid Walsh, , was kned to death by his we-to-be Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, , just weeks after he proposed to her on New Years EveShareCommentsByAine HegartySophie Evans:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsDavid Walsh was stabbed to death by his fiancée, Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, in February last year\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad-of-four called his fianceacutee a slut and asked her about her exes hours before she stabbed him to death, court papers show. David Walsh, , made the remark to his we-to-be, Cathrina “Tina” Cahill, in Sydney, Australia, after a row broke out between them. He is said to have asked the -year-old Irishwoman: How many exes have you had you slut , prompting her to tell him to cop on. It was later that night that he was kned in the neck by Cahill - to whom he had been engaged for just weeks - at their home in the city. The papers reveal the defendant said Mr Walsh needed to be taught a lesson moments before she stabbed him, the Irish Mirror reports. The killing occurred shortly after Mr Walsh started attacking another man whom Cahill and their two female housemates had arrived back with after meeting him at a hotel, according to the papers.  Cahill has admitted killing Mr Walsh on the night of February  last year, only weeks after he popped the question on New Years Eve. She was originally charged with murder over the incident. However, prosecutors accepted her plea to the less serious charge of manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. It was accepted the woman, from County Wexford, was suffering from PTSD as a result of the abusive and violent nature of her relationship. A -page statement of agreed facts submitted to New South Wales Supreme Court this week outlines the explosive events leading up to Cahill stabbing her fianceacute to death with a large-bladed kne. She told police who arrived at the scene: “I stabbed him”. But the next morning, she told cops “my mind has gone blank” and she couldn’t remember picking up the blade and killing the dad. The court document describes in detail how the night of the killing unfolded and how Friday after-work drinks descended into death. The couple started the night at popular Irish hang-out the Cock ‘N’ Bull bar in Bondi Junction with their friends Grace Keegan and Melissa Sinnott, later moving to the Doncaster Hotel. But a row broke out between Cahill and Mr Walsh after Ms Sinnott commented how attractive Tina’s ex-boyfriend was.  Mr Walsh became angry and started to aggravate Cahill, calling her a “bike”. She grew angry and told him to “f*** off”. Mr Walsh then asked her about her exes and called her a sl**, to which she replied: “Cop on Davey and don’t talk to me like that.” According to the document, Cahill went out for a cigarette and Mr Walsh followed her outside, where they continued to argue. When they came back inside, Mr Walsh was “annoyed and frustrated,” he got off his seat and said “f*** this” and stormed off. Cahill, Ms Sinnott and Ms Keegan followed him out. However, he refused to get in the car with them. The women headed back to their Padstow home at pm, changed clothes, locked the house and walked to the Padstow Park Hotel. At the hotel, they met a man called Matthew Hyde after he introduced himself and bought them a round of drinks. He joined them for the rest of the evening and told police he was “keen” on Ms Keegan. The court papers show Mr Walsh went to the Coach And Horses Hotel at Randwick at .pm, where he got into a fight with an Irishman. Security rushed over and separated the pair, before Mr Walsh was escorted from the hotel. The Irishman, Richard Lindsay, went to AE where he received four stitches to his face and four stitches to the back of his head.  Cahill and her friends, who were still at the Padstow Park Hotel, started to receive a number of calls and text messages from Mr Walsh. At .pm, Ms Keegan received text messages with three photos from the young man. They showed broken glass on the floor with blood. Cahill, Ms Sinnott, Ms Keegan and Mr Hyde left the pub shortly before midnight and headed for their house, according to the papers. When they arrived, the front door was smashed and there was a trail of blood leading from the hallway to the kitchen floor and sitting room. Mr Walsh was on the couch, with his wrist cut but not bleeding profusely. Mr Hyde asked him: “Hey mate, are you OK ” He said Mr Walsh’s eyes were open and he mumbled something. He left him on the couch and joined the women in the kitchen when suddenly Mr Walsh hit him from behind. He shouted: “Who the f*** are you ” and hit Mr Hyde several times to the face and head with closed fists. Mr Hyde said: “What the f***! What’s your problem ”. He fell to the floor and ended up on his back with Mr Walsh on top of him, according to the document. The construction worker then repeatedly punched him, grabbed him by the hair and tried to smash his head into the floor. He also bit his face, breaking the skin and causing him to bleed. One of the women managed to pull Mr Walsh off him.  Everyone was yelling, with Mr Hyde describing it as “chaos”. The court papers say Mr Walsh was irate, with his body language described as aggressive. Cahill was screaming out, “Stop it Davey, get off, get off. Cop on. He’s with Grace.” She tried to grab Mr Walsh’s arms and he swung his arm back, according to the document. She then fell to the ground. Cahill moved towards Mr Walsh and punched him in the face with a closed fist, before he pushed her again. Ms Keegan reportedly saw Mr Walsh try to punch Cahill in the face but didn’t knowhe hit her. Mr Hyde started shouting out: “What the f***! Hitting a girl!” Mr Walsh then started punching him again. Cahill got up, holding her head, and walked towards the kitchen. The papers say she was crying hysterically and was “all over the place”. Ms Keegan and Cahill shouted “call the police”. Ms Sinnott repeatedly told Cahill to “calm the f*** down, it is said. However, the defendant opened the cutlery drawer and took out a very large, sharp-bladed kne. Ms Sinnott told her over and over again “put it back.” This was said quietly so the others would not hear. She is said to have replied: “No, he needs to be taught a lesson, it’s not fair, look at poor Matthew.” Ms Sinnott went upstairs to call the police and locked herself in the bathroom. As she went upstairs, Mr Walsh released his grip on Mr Hyde and Ms Keegan pushed him up against the kitchen wall. Documents indicate Cahill than walked quickly towards Mr Walsh with the long-bladed kne “fixated on Davey”. She stabbed Mr Walsh in the neck, with the kne hitting him in the left side of his neck, causing a cm stab wound. Cahill did not say anything and pulled the kne out straight away and dropped it on the floor, according to the papers. The wound started to bleed profusely, with blood coming out of Mr Walsh’s mouth. Ms Keegan placed a tea towel on the wound and Mr Walsh shouted: “Call an ambulance, call an ambulance.” He stumbled away in a daze out of the front of the house. Ms Sinnott called an ambulance. When she came downstairs from the bathroom where she had locked herself, Cahill told her: “He’s gone mental Melissa. I can’t cope no more. I can’t believe what I just done.” She repeated: “What have I done. I’m so sorry.” When police arrived at the scene, they found Mr Walsh on the ground being held in the recovery position by Mr Hyde. Cahill was sobbing kneeling about two metres away from them. When they asked what had happened, she reportedly said: “They were fighting and he [Mr Walsh] grabbed a kne and came at him [Mr Hyde]. I stepped in to help and stabbed him [Mr Walsh]. I stabbed him.” Shortly after, police noted Mr Walsh had stopped breathing and started CPR. Paramedics soon arrived and attempted to save the dad, but he was pronounced dead at the scene at .am. When interviewed by police the next morning at am, Cahill told police she couldn’t remember anything about stabbing her fianceacute. She said: “My mind went blank. My mind has gone blank, the only thing I remember is sitting out the front shouting call the ambulance, please call the ambulance. And then sitting screaming, ‘Please, please save my baby’.” She told investigators her le had been hell with Mr Walsh for the past six months, he never stopped calling her names and she often wished she was not alive so she wouldn’t have to deal with him. Cahill will be sentenced next month.

They have to be ready to come in when they’re required.”Robbie also believes club captain Fraser Fyvie is getting close to full match fitness after his long absence until last month because of knee surgey.“I think he still has a little bit to go and I think he will probably agree with that.“When you’re out for nine months like he’s been then you can take six, eight games to get to it.“He’s getting stronger with every game and he’ll be stronger this week.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee announce first signing under jim mcintyre","story":"Jim McIntyre has made his first move to strengthen his Dundee squad by signing Martin Woods.The -year-old midfielder has put pen to paper on a short term deal until January.The Tele revealed last week the former Partick Thistle man had been training with the club.McIntyre knows Woods well from their time together at Ross County.It#s understood he won#t be available for tomorrow#s clash with Motherwell.More soon#"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss faces jim wait over frontman options after kallman injury","story":"Dundee manager Jim McIntyre faces a wait over who he can select to lead his line at Motherwell.In all three of his matches in charge, Jim has gone with Finnish international Benjamin Kallman up top.However, the Dens gaffer will have to wait and seethe -year-old recovers from the head knock which forced him off against Celtic on Wednesday.Going up for a header – the Dark Blues’ closest attempt at goal – shortly before half-time, Kallman took a blow to the head and was taken straight up the tunnel by physio Gerry Docherty.The Finn is still being assessed and it’s unclear whether he’ll be fit enough to start at Fir Park today.That’s likely to mean a start for Tunisian Sofien Moussa after he replaced Kallman before half-time on Wednesday.The -year-old targetman started the Dark Blues’ boss first match in charge at Livingston but missed the following defeat to Hearts with an Achilles problem.Centre-back Ryan Inniss is also fit after being replaced by Andy Boyle at half-time against Celtic.

It was created with the help of pupils at Craigie High and Kingspark School.Council leader John Alexander said: “This is another piece, albeit a small one, of the jigsaw coming into place.

I know I didn’t forget about it, it’s hard to take but I do much prefer having a game this close rather than have to sit on that Celtic defeat for a week.“Celtic are a top side and they showed it – we showed we are a side in between at the minute.“We had a gameplan and we felt relatively comfortable to begin with but, having been on the other side with Celtic, you know when you get that first goal it drags the opposition out and away from your shape a bit.“We were a bit naive and, out of probably eagerness to try to get back into it, we’ve gone into half positions where some are pressing and some are sitting off which becomes disjointed and we got punished.“We have big games coming up and, thankfully, there’s not the chance to dwell on it which you don’t want to do.”With the Steelmen just five points ahead after a poor start to the Premiership season themselves and then th-placed St Mirren at Dens to come next weekend, the Irish international says it’s “imperative” they start adding to their solitary victory this season.“Motherwell is huge. We can’t afford to look ahead but there is a patch of games where it’s imperative we win.“The manager stressed after the game on Wednesday that we need to seriously get our heads on for today because it is a huge game.”If Dundee are to get a much-needed victory at Fir Park today, O’Dea has called on his team-mates to stick to the gameplan laid down by manager Jim McIntyrethey are to stand up to a test he expects to be “physically demanding”.“Football is  minutes and it’s about resilience and character.

Ideally the game at Kilmarnock will kick us on to a good run.“Our focus is now back on the league and trying to climb the table as much as we can, then all our focus will be on the cup final when that comes around.”Being outwith the top six is not the norm for the Reds under the guidance of boss Derek McInnes.This time last season, after  games the Dons were sitting in second place on  points, just three behind leaders Celtic.After  games Aberdeen now have  points.Shinnie, , reckons an injury crisis, which the Reds are moving out of, has been a mitigating factor in the inconsistent form.At one point eight players were out injured but the majority are now back and available.He said: “We have had a lot of injuries. At the start of the season it was the defenders out as we lost players like Scottand Tommie Hoban.“Then after the Celtic game we lost three or four front players so the team had to be changed throughout the season.“A lot of the boys are back now and the gaffer has a good pool to choose from. It is about carrying on momentum.”In the previous clash with Killie this season Dons defender Mikey Devlin was red carded after just four minutes. It was a blow Aberdeen did not recover from as they lost -.Shinnie said: “Kilmarnock were good against us up here albeit we were down to  men.“They took advantage of that really well. Kilmarnock have players who can hurt you so we will have to be on top of our gamewe are going to get the win.”Shinnie’s contract expires at the end of the season and he will be free to speak to any interested clubs when the winter transfer window opens on January .Aberdeen have tabled a deal that would make him one of the top earners at the club.On his future, Shinnie said: “I am just trying to focus on my football.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm.

The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

He published his opinion on the matter in The Waste of Daylight. Willett was angry at the ldquowaste of useful daylight first thing in the morning during the summer months.Willett died in  and, less than a year later, Germany became the first to adopt DST in April . Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, and Tasmania also immediately followed suit.Three weeks later in the UK, an Act of Parliamentdecreed that, for a certain period during the year, the official time should be one hour in advance of GMT. The United States followed in .Between  and the Second World War, the clocks were put forward by one hour in the UK in spring.During the Second World War, British double summer timewas temporarily introduced. Throughout the winter months, the clocks were kept one hour forward of GMT to increase productivity.After the war ended, Britain ed to British summer timeas it was prior to .In , permanent BST was trialled but it was deemed unsuccessful and abandoned in .In , the duration of BST was changed to bring it into line with the rest of the European community.In , campaigners attempted toto British double summer time or a permanent BST in order to save energy and increase the time available for leisure in the evenings. Backbench MPs tried to change BST, but the The Daylight Saving Bill - failed in the House of Commons.Over the years, the effectiveness of DST has been the topic of much debate.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

Making migration harder would be ldquoan appropriate nudge to go down that route, he said.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said it was ldquoutterly incredible to hear Mr Manning belittle the jobs of those who work in the sector.She said: ldquoMr Manningrsquos comments on the quality of jobs in the hospitality sector are arrogant and dismissive of the great work we do.ldquoThe sector is incredibly dynamic and vibrant.

He does this again today, in the Herald on Sunday, when he calls for directly-elected mayors to oversee the delivery of Scotlandrsquos city deal projects.This devolutionary streak is outside the boundaries of Tory policy, but much more importantly it is also outside the boundaries of Tory orthodoxy. This orthodoxy is tough to expel. When people join the Tory party they are exposed to an instinctive deference to Westminster. They bend the knee. This centralising party, in this centralised country, has historically allowed the liberalism which has led so much of its economic action, and some of its social action, to be snuffed out by conservatism on decentralisation.Tomkins has a baked-in advantage here, because he hasnrsquot been a Tory for particularly long. He is a post-devolution Tory. He can see, I presume, what many Tory lsquolersrsquo cannot. Tory MSPs who, from  until at least , swam against the tide of devolution, were effectively attempting to switch off their own le support machine.Devolution saved the Tories in Scotland. Not because they suddenly went from zero representatives to - that was simply the manestation. It saved them because devolution creates responsibility, and responsibility creates Tories. This is a factual, rather than political, point. It is empirically clear that in times where responsibility, particularly financial responsibility, is most needed, Tories do well, with  and  being the most obvious recent examples.Tomkins has correctly identied the need for such responsibility to be exercised around Scottish city deals, which were intensely political, rather than economic, events. The economic and governance models for many of these deals could have been written with a thick marker on the back of a postage stamp, and the deals would still have been signed.A strong, credible, directly-elected mayor for these pan-local authority regions would not only inject ballast into the process, but would make the dealsrsquo benefits more tangible by giving them a face.For Tomkins, though, I wonder whether the mayor plan is merely the tip of the iceberg.Opposition to independence and or to another independence referendum has been the one and only lsquobig idearsquo the Tory party has had during devolution. Independence is a political cash cow for the Tory party. It is likely to remain profitable for another electoral cycle, after which, post-, it may no longer be.What then  The answer may lie in building a new, modern, centre-right movement from the bottom up, using the vehicle of more powerful, muscular city-regions, with empowered local authorities underneath.Local authorities are relatively powerless. They have little responsibility to exercise, so the electorate has little incentive to elect a party which sees its central selling point as its ability to exercise financial responsibility. The truth is that it doesnrsquot really matter which party runs our local authorities - the outcome is basically the same.But just as the Scottish Parliament gted the Tories a meaningful role at a Scottish level, mayors could gt them a role at a local and regional level. This is important not just as an end in itself, but as a means to create a national movement which is built upon the rock of local delivery, not the sand of the independence question which, one way or another, may soon have an answer.The Tories need a big idea.

It had its own castle. It was leased from the local king who once a year would turn up to collect his commission dressed in a kilt. Isatu Smith, the head of museums and relics in Sierra Leone, describes how the Scottish slavers even built their own golf course on the island and dressed their slave caddies in tartan so they could be reminded of home. \"They were serving Scottish masters, so they had to look the part,\" Smith says. \"We have a shared history. It is very important that the Scottish people know about this ndash whether they accept it or not is another question.\"This week, Scotland will finally learn of the horrors of Bunce Island and be confronted by its forgotten role in the slave trade. David Hayman, the Scottish actor and director, has produced a new two-part documentary which begins on Tuesday night. In it, Hayman, through interviews with experts like Smith, lays bare just how central a role Scotland played in the slave trade.The country was \"up to its armpits in slavery\", Hayman says, even though the nation has always presented itself not just as having little to do with the trade in human lives, but also a country which was a leading light when it came to abolition. It is a  history and one that Hayman is hell bent on correcting.Scottish slavers ran Bunce Island from  to . They imported ice from Europe to keep food and wine cool in larders and enjoyed strolls in a private garden just metres away from pens where hundreds of human beings were kept like cattle before making the deadly Atlantic crossing. An estimated  per cent of slaves died on the journey. Eric Graham, a maritime historian, says that the dead were thrown overboard every morning. \"All slave ships were followed by sharks,\" he says. \"There was a dinner every day for the sharks.\"The Atlantic slave trade saw goods from Britain ndash pots and pans, beads, alcohol, pipes, guns, knives, and cloth ndash traded for human beings in Africa. These slaves were then sold in America. The American cash was used to buy tobacco, sugar, cotton, rum and indigo which were then brought back to Britain. It was a trade that made merchants into millionaires.Scotland in the th century was built on slavery. The Merchant City in Glasgow would not exist without the money that poured into the coffers of tobacco lords and cotton kings ndash who now have city streets named after them. These men were made rich beyond their wildest dreams by the profits of slavery. For the human beings traded as slaves existence was a living hell. Rape, murder, torture, abuse, humiliation and degradation almost beyond imagination, were the stuff of daily le. At least  million slaves survived being shipped across the Atlantic ndash with around .m bought and sold by British slavers, among whom Scots stood out as the most efficient and enterprising.Celeste-Marie Bernier, professor of Black Studies at Edinburgh University, says: \"Slavery bleeds in every building, in every brick, in every town across Scotland.\"According to Hayman: \"Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is a story of uncomfortable truths over how we see ourselves and perhaps that is why it has been forgotten. It challenges the notion that we are all Jock Tamsonrsquos bairns. Scots were plantation owners, slave owners, merchant ship owners. The profits fired Scotlandrsquos industrial growth and in every city in our nation you will find civic buildings and private homes built from the profits of slavery ndash bricks drenched in blood.\"There is now a growing campaign to, as Hayman puts it, \"acknowledge our past\" with an apology and reparations. There is also a campaign to establish a museum to slavery in Scotland, and for memorials and plaques to go up across the country on statues, streets and homes linked to slavery ndash such as the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow which was once the mansion of tobacco lord William Cunningham, a man made rich on the backs of slaves in the Americas.Scotland: a canny wee nation when it comes to rememberingProfessor Sir Tom Devine, the nationrsquos leading historian, says the scale of Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade is \"truly mind boggling\". He believes historians have a \"sacred duty\" to tell the truth about it, just as they have with \"that other horror, the Holocaust\".Adebusola Debora Ramsay, of the Glasgow Slavery Legacy Tour which takes visitors around sites in the city linked to the trade, says that whenever the history of slavery is discussed in Scotland the nation appears to suffer from a \"collective amnesia\".Poet Jackie Kay, Scotlandrsquos Makar and a woman of Nigerian descent, once said: \"Scotland is a canny wee nation when it comes to remembering and forgetting. The plantation owner never wears a kilt and Glasgow does not readily admit its history in a way that other cities have done.\" Liverpool has built a museum to its role in the slave trade and Bristol is in the middle of a long debate over what to do about statues to wealthy slavers in the city.Dr Stephen Mullen, an historian and author of the book \"It Wisnae Us\" about Scotlandrsquos role, says Scots view slavery as a \"peculiarly English problem\", adding: \"Scots have got off the hook.\" Slavery trickled down into every part of Scottish le ndash from the docker who brought sugar into the city, to the grocer who sold it, and the families who bought it to sweeten their tea. One major export from Scotland to the Americas was \"slave cloth\" to make cheap clothes for Africans on plantations. Salted herring from the Highlands had its main market in the islands of the West Indies as food for slaves.The Jamaican-born scientist Sir Geoff Palmer, Professor Emeritus of Le Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, saysBannockburn is in the history books, then slavery should be there as well. Scottish academic Michael Morris, an expert in slavery at Liverpool John Moores University, adds: \"Scots like to promote themselves as part of the civilising mission of the British empire, so we glory iniduals like David Livingstone, and we would prefer to talk about our role in abolition rather than our role in chattel slavery.\"Chris Dolan, the Scottish playwright who wrote an acclaimed novel about the slave trade called Redlegs, believes \"we managed to forget about slavery for an awful long time. Now that we are waking up to the part we did play, it is very dficult for us as we have this mythology we tell ourselves that we are less racist people than other European nations, specically England. That is not true. Therefore to wake up and find we are involved in slavery as much as other parts of Europe is dficult.\"As David Alston, an historian who is now chair of the board of NHS Highland, sees it Scotlandrsquos own historic grievances hold us back when it comes to confronting the past ndash specically events such as the Highland Clearances. \"We want to tell ourselves a story that in the Highlands we were victims,\" he says, \"butyou want to portray yourself as a victim the last thing you want to do is be the victimiser.\"In Jamaica there are thousands of Campbells named after the Scots who owned their ancestorsOne need only look through the records of wealthy Scots to find clues which were always staring us in the face over our shameful past. Just look at the ledgers of Sir Robert Cunningham, a slave owner on St Kitts. In a record from  he lists his horses ndash Jack, Beauty, Trooper, Duke ndash and a few pages later, his slaves: Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Whisky, a blacksmith aged  and worth pound.One of the reasons that it has become easy to forget the past is that we helped destroy it. When Sierra Leone achieved its independence in the s, the departing British took all records of slavery with them.Joannes Caulker, an historic archivist in Freetown, says: \"We lost our history. They only let us know what they wanted us to know.\" Joe Alie, Professor of History at Sierra Leone University, is clear that his country is still paying the price of slavery. Millions of young men and women were taken away, robbing the country of human potential, and forced to slave for white masters. \"While we lost, they gained,\" Alie says. He speaks of an inferiority complex in nations subjected to slavery. \"We were dehumanised during the slave trade era ndash that is a lasting legacy.\"Hayman also journeyed to Jamaica with Graham Campbell, a well known figure in Glasgow with his rasta dreadlocks, and now an SNP councillor in the city. Speaking of the rape of African women by white masters he says that is what \"created people with Scottish names like me\".In the Jamaican phone book there are literally thousands of Campbells ndash page after page of them ndash all named after the plantation owner who once bought their ancestors. The book is also full of Mackenzies, Macleans, McLeods and McPhersons. Scotland and its trade in slaves shaped the modern island. \"I have this name because you were over there,\" says Campbell. \"I am the descendant of survivors.\"On Jamaica there stands a plantation once run by the Stirling Maxwell family, who owned Pollok House in Glasgow, now a national treasure. The plantation was called Hampden. It had more than  slaves. The national costume of Jamaica, the quadrille dress, is tartan. The St Andrewrsquos Cross is in the Jamaican flag. The dock in Jamaica where barely alive slaves were taken from ships before being washed, oiled, shaved and given rum so they would appear in good health for the slave market is called Farquharsonrsquos Wharf ndash it was run by Scots.Further south, in British Guyana, a run of coastal towns is testament to how entrenched Scots were in the slave trade there. The towns all have highland names ndash Belladrum, Cromarty, Dingwall, Dunrobin, Golspie, Inverness. The list goes on and on.A legacy in blood, bricks and mortar: Scotlandrsquos shrines to ill-gotten wealthBack across the sea in Ayrshire, the stately home of Auchincruive stands as a \"colossal shrine to ill gotten wealth\", says Hayman. The house was built by Richard Oswald, a merchant slave trader who was an investor in Bunce Island. Oswald owned four plantations in the Caribbean and left a fortune worth poundm.In Clarkston, on the outskirts of Glasgow, stands another National Trust of Scotland jewel, Greenbank Gardens, once owned by Robert Allason. He and his two brothers had the slave trade sown up. Goods would go from Robert in Glasgow to a brother in Africa to be exchanged for slaves, and then another brother with a plantation in Virginia would pick up the slaves and send tobacco back to Scotland. It was a money machine, with human lives oiling the engines.One of Scotlandrsquos most powerful slavers was John Gladstone of Leith ndash the father of William Gladstone who became one of Britainrsquos most famous prime ministers. When Britain finally abolished slavery in  slave owners received millions in compensation which they went on to invest in industries like banking, mills, mining, and railways. John Gladstone had  slaves for which he was paid a sum worth poundm in todayrsquos money.Jean Francois Manicom, curator of Liverpoolrsquos International Slavery Museum, tells a story of an anonymous donor from Edinburgh, who he describes as a Scottish superhero. Once every fortnight the donor posts a Scottish ten pound note to the museum with an apology on behalf of the nation. \"This is very symbolic,\" says Manicom, \"a very powerful story of reparation.\"Another Liverpool historian, Lawrence Westgaph, himself a descendant of slaves and slave traders, believes that the racism which blights the UK today has its roots in the slave trade. \"Racism comes down to the idea that some people are less human than others and slavery helped cody that. What I see today is that anti-black racism has its origins in the slave trade.rsquo\" Confronting the past, helps draw the poison.How does Scotland confront its past  Apology  Reparations  A memorial So how does Scotland deal with the dreadful legacy of slavery  Historian David Alston says, \"acknowledging the past is the first step ndash it is only after that can you get on to the questions of reparations\". Geoff Palmer says that what would repair the wrongs of the past is a \"country which is wealthier contributing to a country that helped make that wealth\".So apology and then some form of compensation are now coming front and centre among those thinking about how Scotlandrsquos deals with its past. Graham Campbell wants to see schools and colleges in Scotland and Jamaica link up through student exchanges, for business connections to be forged ndash real concrete steps that will help improve education and lives in Jamaica, a country still living with the effects of slavery nearly  years after abolition.For Hayman there is no going back and no hiding place. \"We rewrote history to make ourselves look the good guys for abolishing slavery while blaming everyone  ndash well now is the time for truth.\"He adds, \"I like to think I live in a modern Scotland that is open-minded, free-thinking, liberal, tolerant, warm and friendly. Scots are loved the world over, but less than five generations ago our ancestors helped create and sustain crimes against humanity on an industrial scale simply to get stinking rich. This is an uncomfortable truth, but hopefully we can now find the courage and dignity to say we are sorry.\"Slavery: Scotlandrsquos hidden shame begins at pm on BBC  on Tuesday, November "},{"url":null,"title":"slavery-museum-to-be-set-up-in-glasgow","story":"Council leader Susan Aitken said they were poised to make an announcement in the near future about a \"comprehensive piece of work\" that would be regarded as a \"brave thing to have undertaken.\"It is understood that the Gallery of Modern Art in the city has been named as a possible site for a new museum commemorating Scotlandrsquos role in the Slave Trade.Glasgow City Council supports the idea of a museum to slavery ndash although not a specic location.

Millions died as a result of the slave trade, and it is seen as one of the worst crimes against humanity in history.As well as a museum of slavery, campaigners want plaques erected at statues and on streets connected to slavery. Many streets in Glasgows city centre are named after businessmen involved in the slave trade.The ramping up of the campaign for some form of \"reparative justice\" from Scotland came as one of Jamaicarsquos leading voices, the journalist and broadcaster Earl Moxam, warned that Jamaica and other Caribbean nations would likely seek reparation from Scotland in the event of independence.Speaking in the new documentary, produced by actor and director David Hayman, Moxam said the Scottish Government ldquoought to be aware ... thatit were to go the route of independence then I would expect that Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean would make a direct appeal for reparations formally to Scotland, to the independent Scottish government.Graham Campbell, an SNP councillor in Glasgow who is descended from slaves in Jamaica, is one of the leading voices campaigning for Scotland to make amends for its past role, and for the establishment of a museum of slavery. He said the museum should be at GoMA given the buildingrsquos past links to the trade. \"That is the obvious place,\" he said, adding: \"The city must make a gesture.\"Campbell also raised the question of whether streets in Glasgow named after merchants involved in the slave trade should be renamed.Hayman said: \"The first thing we have to do is apologise. The Scottish Government can say as a nation that we are deeply sorry for the horror we created  years ago ndash there is nothing wrong in saying sorry.\"Hayman also suggested a statue or memorial to the victims of slavery should also erected in Glasgow. He also supports the idea of twinning towns and cities in Scotland with places in Africa and the Caribbean where Scots were involved in slavery.Zandra Yeaman of the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights , which is also campaigning for a museum of slavery, said there was a ldquogrowing recognition of the need to represent the realities of empire, colonialism, slavery and migration within mainstream heritage and history.She added that ldquocities like Liverpool, London and Bristol have found a way to address this through dedicated spaces ndash museums, archives and learning centres. We think itrsquos time Scotland had a space to fulfil this need.The campaign for Scotland to make amends for the past has gained added impetus following the decision by Glasgow University to publish a report into its own historic links to the slave trade. The university won praise for admitting it had ldquoreceived signicant financial support from people whose wealth at least in part derived from slavery in the th and th centuries.Equalities minister Christina McKelvie said the Scottish Government wants to ldquoconsider how we can reflect on Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade."},{"url":null,"title":"saving-aviemore-community-buyout-plan-for-cairngorm-mountain-resort","story":"In a race to prevent the resort ndash and the neighbouring town of Aviemore ndash collapsing into terminal decline, local people and politicians are mobilising.Scotlandrsquos largest and potentially most complex community buyout is being compiled in a bid to create a new, all-year-round attraction. The plans, by the Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust, include building a network of summer mountain bike trails, an Alpine bobsleigh-style coaster, an education centre, and a self-sufficient hydro electric scheme.But, most importantly, it is a way for the community to protect its livelihood amid mounting concerns over the future of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise-owned ski and snowboard resort, which has seen years of falling market share, and accusations of poor management and lack of investment.The resortrsquos prospects for this winter have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that the pound. million funicular railway, which transports visitors from car park to upper slopes, is out of action amid safety concerns for the structure.The funicular railwayrsquos foundations are being inspected by specialist engineers who are due to report on its future next month. However, by then the winter weather is expected to make signicant repair work unlikely until next spring.Concerns over the railwayrsquos future and the impact on snow sports enthusiasts who have already bought   season tickets follows the dismantling of the resortrsquos chairlts last autumn. That move sparked fury among snow sports enthusiasts and raised further questions over the management of the area at a time when rival centres appear to be flourishing.If it was to go ahead, a community buyout would dwarf other land-grab projects in terms of scale and potential financial implications.While numbers visiting Cairngorm for snow sports have fallen, with the resortrsquos market share sliding from . per cent in  to . per cent last year, a buoyant winter season of skiing and snowboarding is estimated to be worth pound million to the Speyside economy.Community buyout campaigners say questions over the funicular railway ndash essential for transporting learner skiers and snowboarders to upper levels ndash plus a surprise decision by the HIE-appointed resort operator, Cheshire-based Natural Retreats, to close its ski school operation for the season, has brought the future of the mountain to a crossroads.Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust director Mike Dearman said: ldquoThe operatorsrsquo announcement not to operate a ski school seems to say that they have no faith in their own ability to run skiing on the mountain.ldquoPeople are worried, but in some ways it has galvanised them. We believe therersquos a positive future for Cairngorm snow sports, and some relatively small investment could move it forwards.The buyout proposals suggest AGCT could take over ownership of the land and assets from HIE, and inherit the -year lease deal with Natural Retreats. The community trust would then work with the operator to seek fresh funding streams, allowing HIE to revert to its traditional role of supporting the business and sustainable development.It suggests an pound, investment in hydro-electric schemes at Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste which would provide an income stream plus power lts and snow-making equipment.A poundm snow factory would produce cover for lower slopes, while km of mountain bike trails and a year-round Alpine coaster ndash a winding track which would carry thrillseekers down the mountainside ndash would attract summer visitors, bringing much-needed investment and seasonal work.Drew Hendry, MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said he would be ldquodelighteda community buyout were to proceed.ldquoThere needs to be a change, he said. ldquoNatural Retreats has lost the confidence of local people. Communication with the public has been awful. They have shown an inability to engage properly and there has been an unacceptable sequence of events from the closing of the ski school to a lack of information of the problems affecting the funicular.ldquoI would be delighted[the buyout] was brought forward in a desirable timescale. However, we need action now and the community proposal would take some time to get together.He added: ldquoIrsquove contacted [Rural Economy Secretary] Fergus Ewing, and I am asking HIE and Natural Retreats to get around the table to sort something out. We canrsquot go through another season where we have got skiers in other resorts and not coming to Cairngorm.Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said: ldquoThe situation with the funicular has brought things to a head and prompted a lot of concerns. The conversation over who runs the mountain has gone on for over two years. While there is a community proposal, itrsquos one thing saying the current operators are not good enough, and another to come up with an alternative.Campaigners anxious to secure the future of snow sports in the area believe the time is right for the buyout.Alan Brattey, of Aviemore Business Association, said: ldquoI have no doubt that the Cairngorm mountain business will come to local businesses and the AGCT to manage. The plans they have are substantial and will drive forward the need for radical change.Questions have been raised over whether the funicular railway can be repaired and,so, whether the repairs will enable the facility to run reliably for many years to come.Susan Smith, business development manager at HIE, defended the management of the snow sport facility.She said: ldquoItrsquos been hard for the operator in many ways because there was a signicant requirement initially to understand the mountain environment and business opportunity. Running a mountain business is tough and complex and requires signicant amount of resources to get it right. We understand the frustration of the community.Smith added that the issues affecting the funicular railway were not foreseen. ldquoThis came up under a routine inspection. Itrsquos a complex engineering structure and specialist bridge engineers need to look at it.ldquoHealth and safety is paramount."},{"url":null,"title":"from-scots-chamonix-to-community-on-its-knees-the-race-to-save-cairngorm-mountain-and-aviemore","story":"For hardy Scots skiers keen to feel the mountain breeze ndash evenit did sometimes result in being blown off course by gale-force winds or skiing blind through pea-soup fog, all roads led north on the A to Aviemore.Convoys of weekend skiers climbed the winding road through Rothiemurchus estate and past Loch Morlich skis which had been hired or serviced at the bustling Ski Shack in the town centre were strapped to roof racks and an apregraves ski session planned for the Cairngorm Hotel, Skiing Doo or the Red McGregor.They found runs capable of challenging experts and, in the Ptarmigan Bowl, a wide basin of soft snow and gentle slopes which, thanks to the introduction of the pound. million funicular railway in , meant beginners could find their ski legs while savouring the postcard scenery of the valley below.Today, however, storm clouds are gathering over the mountain and what was once Scotlandrsquos premier ski resort. Businesses and locals who rely on it for their livelihoods are asking serious questions over how the snow sport centre is operated and its ability to continue to attract winter tourists.Concern had been already mounting over a recent slump in skier and snowboarder numbers which have seen the resort slip behind its rivals.A controversial decision last year to dismantle the mothballed Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts enraged mountain enthusiasts who had already expressed doubts over mountain owner Highlands and Island Enterprise and Cairngorm Mountain operator Natural Retreatsrsquo investment plans.Now technical problems affecting the funicular ndash the only route up for non-skiers and beginners ndash mean it is almost certain not to run this winter.For experienced skiers and snowboarders who do make the journey to Cairngorm, it means they are likely to face long queues for the T-bar and poma tows. Itrsquos even bleaker for beginners, who will be left kicking their boots on lower slopes prone to poor snow cover, hoping new snow-making equipment can help.Itrsquos understood a routine inspection revealed issues with floating bearings on the track which help it cope with extreme mountain temperatures. However, specialist engineers have now been brought in to inspect the railwayrsquos foundations.With the engineersrsquo report not due until early next month and the bitter winter weather expected to curb any repair programme, Natural Retreats marked the day of the first snowfall to deliver bombshell news to more than  ski school workers that their services would not be required.They join staff at the Ptarmigan Restaurant at the top of the funicular who, with no railway to feed tourists uphill, had already been told to stand down at least until the winter season kicks in. That has fuelled concerns over the operatorrsquos commitment to the resort and sparked interest among local campaigners to press ahead with plans to mount a community buyout, to develop their own vision for its future.All of which is cold comfort for local businesses facing the prospect of a bleak winter.Naeela Shahzad of Aviemore Convenience Store on Grampian Road said: ldquoIf you donrsquot get tourists up in numbers, then yoursquore in trouble.ldquoItrsquos not just skiers who use the funicular railway, some people just go up for the view. They take the funicular railway, look around and then spend time in Aviemore.ldquoPeople come to Aviemore at Christmas because they want snow. They want to go up the hill to see the views and the only way they can do that is by train. There is real concern among businesses over what will happen.Already one of Aviemorersquos most familiar names in snowsports, the Ski Shack, has closed, citing the ldquosituation on Cairngorm for its demise.Meanwhile Colin Little, manager of Mamborsquos Cafeacute Bar in the centre of Aviemore, said concern has been fuelled by confusion.ldquoNo one seems to know whatrsquos going on. Therersquos a lot of concern that it will be a dficult season, he said. ldquoThere will be tows and uplt available so wersquore all trying to stay positive.According to local MSP Kate Forbes, the situation gripping the resort is ldquopotentially devastating.ldquoThe impact of this throughout the local economy is signicant. Itrsquos snow sports that brings people to Aviemore in the winter.ldquoTherersquos no question this situation has an enormous impact on not just local hospitality and transport sectors but on the wider economy too.ldquoTo be announcing in late autumn, on the first weekend of snow, that a ski school isnrsquot going to operate, is inexplicable.ldquoEnough is enough.But just why has the former jewel in the crown of Scottish snow sport fallen so dramatically on its face To trace Cairngormrsquos problems means rewinding time to , when Aviemorersquos status as a holiday destination was taking shape in the form of a clunky concrete centre featuring go-karts, ice rink, cinema and its showpiece attraction, Santa Claus Land.The mountainrsquos ski tows and chairlts were the envy of Scotlandrsquos other resorts ndash and, indeed, many continental ski areas ndash when the Scottish Office took the controversial decision to transfer Cairngorm Estate from the Forestry Commission to HIErsquos predecessor body, the Highlands and Islands Development Board.ldquoThatrsquos where the problems began, says Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland. ldquoBoth HIDB and HIE displayed flagrant incompetency in how they dealt with the mountain. They simply chewed up one site after another, starting with Lurchers Gully and then the funicular railway.ldquoThey were told the railway was the wrong option, and a modern chairlt was a better option. But they would not listen.As well as the current engineering issues, the railwayrsquos tracks are prone to being covered by drting snow requiring staff with shovels to clear them before the trains can run.But even before its construction there were deep concerns over whether it would provide an effective alternative to a chairlt or gondola structure, and over its impact on the stony plateau of the Cairngorm mass, the only place in western Europe where both arctic and alpine habitats thrive.Its lower slopes nurture eagles, pine marten, wild cats and merlin higher up are found dotterel, snow bunting and ptarmigan.The mountain and its surroundings are designated a Special Area of Conservation, and the funicular plans horried the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ndash yet their concerns were thrown out by the Court of Session.The White Lady chairlt was torn down amid claims that the railway would see a boom in skier numbers, bringing , to the hill each year. Many locals scoffed at those figures.English-based Natural Retreats, a leisure and travel business based around eco-lodges and cottages, was appointed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise four years ago to run the centre for a -year period.If the intention was to halt any potential decline, the plan quickly fell flat.ldquoWe will build the best Terrain Park in the world here, and my long-term goal is to host the summer and winter X Games at Cairngorm Mountain, said Matthew Spence, CEO at Natural Retreats, at the time.ldquoWe will nurture, develop and create future British Olympians at Cairngorm Mountain. These athletes will win gold medals at the Winter Olympics in  and the Summer Olympics in  ndash we want to bring a true sense of pride and place to one of Scotlandrsquos most incredible assets.That, points out Aviemore and Glenmore Trust spokesman Mike Dearman, hasnrsquot quite materialised.ldquoPeople have been frustrated, these new operators came in with great promises, and then not a lot happened.ldquoThey came out with a plan for a new day lodge but it wasnrsquot well received. As far as skiers and snowboarders are concerned, they want good uplt and less queues.ldquoThen they came up with a plan for a dry slope which again wasnrsquot well received. Therersquos real frustration that their promises have not been acted upon.With Aviemorersquos reputation as the Scotlandrsquos winter playground in shreds, focus is shting towards radical solutions ndash including calls toownership of the mountain from Highlands and Islands Enterprise back to its original Forestry Commission owners, or for a community buyout.That idea emerged after horried snow sport and mountain enthusiasts witnessed the surprise removal of the Coire na Ciste and West Wall chairlts. ldquoThat cost pound, even though they could have been refurbished for less, adds Dearman.The irony of that decision is now evident. A refurbishment of the Ciste chairlt could have offered a ready-made solution to the funicular railway problems.Alan Brattey of Aviemore Business Association and owner of Avonglen self-catering accommodation said: ldquoHIErsquos long-term strategy with Cairngorm Mountain has been found out to be completely flawed.ldquoThe focus was completely concentrated on the funicular railway to the detriment of the rest of the ski area that thatrsquos been found out.ldquoHaving invested more than poundm in the funicular railway they had the view they need to get as many bums on seats to justy the cost of running it. That has been to the detriment of the rest of the infrastructure.ldquoHIE suffers from enormous institutionalised arrogance ndash it doesnrsquot listen to anyone.Meanwhile Morris points out the financial implications. ldquoCairngorm is losing market share all the time and the government is going to have to respond.ldquoItrsquos probably going to take nothing less than another poundm to sort this out.WHAT THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS SAYDespite local fury and concern for the season ahead, no-one from Natural Retreats was available to talk about the issues. A company statement said: ldquoWe welcome the investment from HIE. This new snowmaking equipment at Cairngorm Mountain will go a long way to supporting the surface lts running out of the Day Lodge area and create a learner area meaning snowsports enthusiasts can come to our resort and enjoy skiing and snowboarding.ldquoThis is great news for beginners and families who love to come to CairnGorm Mountain.Meanwhile HIE head of business development, Susan Smith, said: ldquoItrsquos fair to say that therersquos the prospect of funicular not operating during winter, but we donrsquot know what the engineering report will say.ldquoBusiness support service is being offered by Business Gateway and a Highland Council marketing campaign led by Cairngorm Business Partnership is giving a very clear message that wersquore open for business.ldquoWe know therersquos huge frustration, but health and safety is paramount.BACKGROUNDThe small Speyside village had already been on the tourist radar for decades when the first hardy skiers arrived in Aviemore.The arrival of a Victorian railway in the late s brought the tiny community its first taste of just how lucrative the emerging tourism sector could be.For the first skiers, enjoying the crisp mountain snow meant trudging uphill with skis strapped to their backs. Scotlandrsquos first ski lt in Glencoe in , was a game-changer.On  December , Cairngormrsquos White Lady chairlt, the first mechanised uplt on Cairngorm mountain and reputed to be the worldrsquos first detachable chairlt, carried its first skiers on a chilly -minute journey to the top of the hill.Hatched by a group of friends from the Glasgow shipyards, all members of the Creaghdhu Mountaineering Club, it launched Aviemore as a winter sport hub.By the mid-s, Cairngormrsquos network of chairlt, poma and T-bar tows made it one of the worldrsquos most highly developed ski areas, and Aviemore an exciting holiday destination.Lord Allander, of the House of Fraser chain of department stores, poured millions into creating a Highland playground resort.Concrete buildings in the village centre were not particularly attractive by todayrsquos standards, but were ahead of their time combining accommodation, ice rink, go-karts, swimming and Scotlandrsquos first purpose-built retail park in a single location.A generation of Scottish children grew up fascinated by Santa Claus Land. Unveiled in the mid-Seventies, it offered funfair rides, meetings with local man George Swinney, whose feathery white beard and jovial nature sent little ones home convinced they had just delivered their Christmas list to the man himself.But by the late s, Santa Claus Land ndash by then a mismatch of inflatable Father Christmas, funfair rides, a model railway and a plastic dinosaur ndash seemed to sum up an area on its knees.Concerned that jobs were at risk and the area was on a downward slide, pound.m of European money was found to prop it up.At the heart of the rejuvenation plans was to replace the White Lady chairlt with a new funicular railway that would bring income to the mountain all year around.Now, as attention focuses on Aviemores future, it once again appears that the only way to go is up."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-plea-to-make-foodbanks-part-of-the-social-security-system","story":"Mark Frankland, of Dumfries-based First Base, which gives out  food parcels a year across Dumfries and Galloway, said: ldquoThere seems to be a complete determination never to treat foodbanks as part of the welfare state. But  per cent of our referrals come from people working for the state ndash from Job Centres, social workers, homeless teams.ldquoPeople say lsquowe want to get rid of foodbanksrsquo. Butthey hadnrsquot been around, you might well have seen people starve.Mr Frankland, who recently gave evidence at Holyroodrsquos Social Security Committee, said with food and child poverty expected to spike over the next five years, the government should consider funding foodbanks. ldquoThat would let us put more items in a food parcels, such as fresh fruit and veg or vouchers for people who run out of power.ldquoIf what is on offer from the DWP isnrsquot enough to keep body and soul together, we are there to be considered, he said. ldquoI donrsquot think the system would be abused. People generally hate walking through our doors unless they absolutely have to. ldquoHe added ldquoWe treat people very dferently from a bureaucrat. Why is it so bad for someone to go and get a bag of food, donated by people who give a damn, rather than turning up at an office to get pound from a grudging bureaucrat However poverty campaigners reject the suggestion that emergency food parcels should become one of the elements of on offer from the welfare state. Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance, said: ldquoWe support foodbanks, I give to them myself all the time. But no matter how much foodbanks are needed they are not a sufficient response. If our response to poverty becomes less based on security and peoplersquos rights and more to do with charitable giving and donations, that is likely to be stigmatising.Polly Jones, project manager of Menu for Change, which argues for alternatives to emergency food aid, said: ldquoPeople running foodbanks do it out of the best intentions. They are trying to step up and help. But the idea that it should be pulled in as part of our universal social security system is the wrong approach.ldquoWe need to make social security systems work better and fix the holes in the safety net first.ldquoIf foodbanks worked, people wouldnrsquot go back again, but in fact the vast majority using foodbanks do , at least once.Mr Frankland also claimed people on low incomes were being hard-hit by price rises from major supermarkets, which he accused of quietly raising the price of some of their cheapest items.The shopping bill for First Base, which tops up donated food to ensure parcels are nutritionally balanced, has doubled in a year, he said, from pound a month to pound a month.While the charity has seen a ten percent increase in demand, the bulk of the cost has come from price rises on supermarketsrsquo value ranges, he said.ldquoIT seems to be standard policy to limit availability and raise prices in their value ranges. Tesco has got rid of many of its lsquovaluersquo products and replaced them with other brands, while value range longer le milk has disappeared from the shelves. It used to cost us  pence a litre, now the next cheapest option is  pence.ldquoWe are seeing unbelievable price rises on food at the lowest end of the market. It feels asthey are targeting the very poorest customers so they can keep their main range prices the same. ldquo"},{"url":null,"title":"arron-banks-insists-no-russian-money-and-no-interference-in-leaveeu-campaign","story":"The controversial business figure, now the subject of a National Crime Agency probe into the source of payments worth pound million, insisted all the money was legitimate and came from his UK-registered firm, Rock Services.And in an outspoken intervention Mr Banks:*hit out at the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, which he accused of being a biased body made up of ex-MPs from the SNP and Labour, claiming it was ldquopolitically motivated*accused the Conservative Government of ldquodisgraceful behaviour in a ldquosell-out of Brexit*described British politics as a ldquosewer, denouncing a group of ldquovicious MPs for seeking to undermine the referendum result*and even suggested it would probably have been betterBritain had voted to Remain in the EU and ldquonot unleash these demons.The investigation by the National Crime Agency was launched after the Commission said it had reasonable grounds to suspect Mr Banks was not the true source of the cash.But the controversial businessman told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: \"There was no Russian money and no interference of any type.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amAdvertorial: DEERNESS STORES, DEERNESS, KW QW OFFERS OVER £, + S.A.V.

It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

It may be two months until the big day but Christmas is already taking shape in the centre of Edinburgh.It gets a little earlier each year. There was a time when Remembrance weekend marked the start of the transformation. After the red crosses were removed from Princes Street Gardens, the gingerbread houses of the Christmas Market started to appear.A few years ago, the Garden of Remembrance moved to allow for construction of a funfair ride but still not much happened before Halloween. Now the last week of October marks the start of the relentless commercialisation of the city centre. Is it a coincidence that the felling of trees in Princes Street Gardens was done just in time to create extra space for the Christmas market  It certainly seems convenient.But there is a more fundamental question facing anyone who lives in Scotland’s capital city. What’s it all for Edinburgh council will say it is for the benefit of locals and visitors but how do they know that  While the extension of the tram line to Newhaven seems to require endless consultation, who knows what the people of Edinburgh want the city centre to be : Some people might want it to be an entertainment theme park with non-stop festivals and endless opportunities to eat and drink. Others might just want it to be a place where people can live, work and shop unhindered. The point is, it would be nice to be asked. At the centre of it all is the Edinburgh Festival. For the month of August, the city becomes a stage and that is a wonderful thing.But the reward for putting up with all the congestion and disruption was traditionally  months of relative normality. Not any more. Nowadays Edinburgh’s Christmas consists of weeks of commercialisation with pop-up stalls where you can buy everything from sugar mice to wooden toys but mostly it is about selling booze.Edinburgh now has  festivals scattered across the calendar. The one gap that remained was after Hogmanay but even that is now being plugged by a new Burns Festival at the end of January which aims to attract thousands of participants to the city centre. That will make  festivals across the year. Unlucky for some. : Edinburgh’s Christmas market named best in UKWhile Edinburgh grows its reputation as a playground, the city centre population is falling as more and more inhabitants decide they cannot stand the endless disruption. Instead the city now has , short-term let properties listed on Airbnb.The row over fencing being erected around Princes Street Gardens for a concert this summer showed that increasing commercialisation and free access to the public realm is an increasing area of conflict.As one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, Edinburgh needs to decide how it wants the future to be. If we want the city to be a stage for non-stop commercial events, we are going about it the right way.Butwe want it to be a real living and working city for local people, we need to halt the race to make money from every space every month of the year.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4823708.1541164808!/image/image.jpg","title":"david cameron is wrong to think he can make comeback leader comment","story":"Former Prime Minister David Cameron reportedly wants toto politics because he is #bored#, but he should # at the very least # wait until the full effects of Brexit become clear.Shortly after David Cameron became Prime Minister in , a regular Ipsos-Mori poll on the most important issues facing Britain recorded its lowest ever score for the one that ultimately led to his downfall.Just one per cent of those surveyed felt the EU was a pressing concern and the figure was well below ten per cent when Cameron decided to call a referendum on Britain’s membership. Last month,  per cent rated the EU and Brexit as one of the UK’s most important issues, while economy, education and crime all took a back seat on less than  per cent. Such figures have led some to the belief that Cameron manufactured a national crisis out of nothing – apart from decades of infighting within the Conservative party – then departed too swtly, leaving others to clean up the mess.However, he is now reportedly planning ato politics as he is “bored s***less” – perhaps not the reason he would pitch to a Conservative constituency association’s selection committee – and has the post of Foreign Secretary in mind. Hours after the Sun first ran the report, it had not been denied by the man himself, an easy thing to dohe were so inclined. : David Cameron: Calling a referendum on the EU was the right choiceCameron may take comfort from the comebacks of past Tory leaders.

William Hague was leader when the party lost the  election, but was Foreign Secretary from  to .However, while both politicians were damaged by failure, unlike Cameron these were not defeats of their own making. They were still well regarded by many in the party’s ranks. It goes without saying that the Brexiteers are not Cameron’s biggest fans, but Tory Remainers were hardly falling over themselves to welcome him back yesterday. The Conservative Home website’s daily news round-up relegated the story to an “And finally ...” item.That left it to Labour politicians to give the verdict, with Yvette Cooper MP tweeting: “You ripped up our closest international partnership. By accident. That makes you even worse than Boris Johnson.”And, given UK Government assessments that a no-deal Brexit could result in economic “Armageddon”, it does seem a bit rich for the person who may have put Britain on the path to that bleak future to be lining up one of the four Great Offices of State for himself.: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824248.1541280668!/image/image.jpg","title":"teachers being made to change reports claims whistleblower","story":"Teachers in Scotland are being pressurised by management to change the wording of school reports and adjust pupils# attainment levels upwards, it has been claimed.The claim that “bullying tactics” are being used against teachers to improve pupils’ results has been made in a letter to Nicola Sturgeon from an anonymous teacher.The letter paints a bleak picture of Scottish education, claiming the system is in crisis and people are afraid to speak out for fear of reprisals from their schools or local authorities.The author said the letter had been written in order to speak out about the “volatile situation” that Scottish education finds itself in and lists complaints including the workload, an “authoritarian” culture and the bureaucratic burden placed on teachers. The letter, which was also sent to the Lib Dems, has come to light at a time when Sturgeon and John Swinney, the Education Secretary, are under intense pressure over their handling of the education brief. Scotland’s largest teaching union, the EIS, is embroiled in a damaging row with the Scottish Government and the local authorities’ body, Cosla, over pay.Teachers are demanding a  per cent rise to make up for years of austerity and the EIS is urging its members to reject a Scottish Government Cosla offer and has opened a ballot on industrial action.Swinney was attacked by opponents for persisting with tests for pupils in primary one despite Holyrood voting against them. Last week Scottish Government data showed the number of primary schools forced to share headteachers had risen by almost two thirds to  since .Sturgeon and Swinney have staked their political reputations on closing the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils.But questions about how pupils are assessed were raised in the anonymous letter, which claimed teachers were often “gagged” by management when it came to school reports.“In my experience, we as teachers are often gagged by management as to how honest we can be in our reports,” the author said. “I am not the only teacher who has been askedto change the wording or tracking indicators in my reports to make it more positive. This is a disturbing and insidious practice. I am a big believer in positive reinforcement and restorative practice but we should never be asked to put a positive spin on a pupil’s academic performance or behaviourit cannot be justied, let alone backed up by evidence.”The teacher claimed “appeasing” parents in this way distorted reality and kept them from complaining.“I know of several colleagues across dferent Scottish local authorities, who have had undue pressure exerted on them by management to change the wording of their reports, tracking indicators or indeed even the attainment levels,” the teacher continued. “By doing this management are asking teachers to compromise their professional judgment and integrity. Teachers who do not bend under undue managerial pressure and refuse to redact comments made in their reports, for example, can be forced into an impossible position: being marginalised by management and having their report modied by a member of the senior management team against their professional judgement.”The letter’s author also suggested there was “pressure coming from the top” to make attainment look better than it actually is.The teacher added: “Not only is this unacceptable, bullying tactics but it totally undermines the concept of teacher professional judgement.”Sturgeon and Swinney were urged to change the “authoritarian and blame-apportioning culture” in schools, warning teachers were reluctant to use whistleblowing procedures for fear of reprisals. Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott said: “Scotland’s teachers are overworked and underappreciated and, despite the promises, we see no sign these pressures are going to dissipate.“EIS negotiators are describing the latest Scottish Government pay offer as ‘derisory’ and ‘isive’. John Swinney has shown little inclination to listen to teachers. I hope Sturgeon will have the humility to sit down with teachers and listen to their serious concerns.“Teachers are the backbone of Scottish education and they ought to command the pay and conditions to reflect that. That is one reason Scottish Liberal Democrats have been calling for an independent expert commission to review teachers’ terms and the demands placed upon them.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Teachers are best placed to know how the children in their classes are progressing. No teacher should feel under any pressure to alter their professional judgment of a learner’s progress. Standardised assessments now provide a valuable additional tool to establish the attainment being achieved by pupils, supporting teachers’ own judgments, and ensuring they can be robust and consistent in their reporting of attainment.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824279.1541321426!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may strikes secret brexit deal over customs union","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May is hopeful of keeping Britain in a customs union and avoiding the need for a hard border in Northern Ireland after receiving #private concessions# from the European Union, according to reports.

This will allow us to make further progress with the review of procurement policy for future ferry operating contracts.“Our ferry services are iconic transport links that play a vital role for our island economies. Making sure they continue to support the communities they serve, as well as delivering best value for taxpayer’s money, will always remain at the heart of our ferry operations.”NorthLink#s managing director Stuart Garrett said: “We are pleased to have been awarded this contract extension and we will be working closely with the Scottish government and CMAL as the ownership of the passenger vessels is transferred.“We have a positive history of working with CMAL and look forward to continuing to deliver this service with business as usual during the contract extension.”Excellent that means we can look forward to a lack of cabins and an inability to get in and out of aberdeen with any kind of weather for many years to come. This may be an excellent piece of business for the scoti government but it is bad news for us.Yes, it seems odd that, having lambasted Tavish Scott for his involvement in bringing about the use of these vessels, the SNP Scottish government has now bought them.One of the criticisms made was that the vessels# design causes them to use grossly excessive amounts of fuel, compared to other designs, e.g. Pentland Ferries catamarans.Fuel is a major component of vessel running costs so hopes of cutting costs and hence fares by improving efficiency appear to have been dashed by this move.It presumably also rules out companies like Pentland Ferries who run their Orkney-Caithness operation without subsidy, in competition with NorthLink, from entering the bidding for future contracts, which now have the look of becoming a #shoo-in# for nationalised group Cal-Mac.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"historical treasure trove revealed at clifton house","story":"THE BELFAST Charitable Society has uncovered a suitcase of letters and material from World War One while preparing for its autumn series of lectures. letters tell the story of Irish Pfficer Patrick Dixon’s le at the front during the war through correspondence with his parents in upper middle class Dublin.Paula Reynolds, CEO of the Belfast Charitable Society, said: “Our colleague and volunteer, Jim McFerran, has been tirelessly working his way through the Dixon family papers ensuring they are all documented and sorted appropriately.“When our Archive and Heritage Officer unearthed the letters we were astonished at first of all the amount of the material, as well as the condition of it.” Aaron McIntyre, Archive and Heritage Officer at Clton House, said: “These letters and material are of great importance and we are very excited about their signicance. It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time.

The UK has given written commitments last December and March that the Withdrawal Agreement will give a legal guarantee of noto a hard border in Ireland in any circumstance - this is the backstop,\" Mr Coveney said.\"In March the UK agreed this backstop will apply unless and until a close future relationship eliminates any need for border infrastructure or related checks and controls. We want the EU and UK to get to negotiating that close future deal but the UK must first deliver on the commitments of leaving.\"The EU support to Ireland has been and remains unwavering.\"The negotiators are working hard and a running commentary isn’t helpful. Today’s Sunday Times piece is obviously aimed at a UK audience.\"However Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, Jean Claude Juncker and indeed Theresa May herself, have all said there will not be a deal without a legal guarantee of no hard border in Ireland.\"We hope a deal can be done but we’re not there yet.”The Times article states the EU will write an all-UK customs deal into the legally binding withdrawal agreement from the EU. If this happens, the backstop - designed by the EU and which treats Northern Ireland as dferent from the rest of the UK - will no longer be required.It also claims Theresa May is on course to securing a Canada-style trade deal.A senior Whitehall source told the paper: \"The PM will be able to say theres no more backstop, weve got rid of that - success. Theres an exit mechanism - success. And youve got Canada - success.

It is UK-wide — success. There’s an exit mechanism — success. And you’ve got Canada.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

A wayward box kick from Rhys OrsquoDonnell allowed Buccaneers to pile on the pressure and when flanker Oli Loughead collapsed a driving maul, he received a yellow card and the visitors eventually scored a soft try from a five metre scrum after another maul was well defended.The home side then took control of the match, scoring two fine tries before half-time.Rory Butler recovered an OrsquoDonnell kick and multiple phases later was on hand to put Richard Reaney in for the score to take the lead and when Buccaneers were turned over as they tried to play out of defence, excellent interplay between centres Butler and Callum McLaughlin enabled Boomer to release Kelly, who finished well in the corner to leave the half-time score at -.Early Buccaneers pressure in the second half was well defended on their own line by the lsquoHinch forwards, with OrsquoToole and Boomer prominent and when skipper Aaron Cairns put in a great kick down the line, lsquoHinch pressure on the line out led to an attacking scrum.OrsquoDonnell scored as the lsquoHinch pack drove their opponents over the line for the bonus point score. Cairns then scored the try of the match with a brilliant line close to the ruck near the halfway line taking him into space.He then accelerated round the opposition defence to score. It was all lsquoHinch at this point and as the men from Athlone began to chase the game, a loose pass gave Reaney the opportunity to hack the ball through for the sixth lsquoHinch try. Reaney then turned provider with a fine break leading to OrsquoDonnellrsquos second score as the home side stretched their lead out to -.With the result secured, lsquoHinch management emptied the bench and consequently lost some of their intensity, but there was still time for Reaney to complete his hat-trick with a well-finished score after some excellent offloading between forwards and backs.To their credit, Buccaneers never gave up and they were rewarded with an unlikely bonus point as they took full advantage of some poor defending at the set piece from a lsquoHinch team which had clearly switched off to score three late converted tries and bring respectability to the scoreboard.Ballynahinch move up to third in the table and will travel to Naas at the weekend in good form.They will know that after missing seven out of eight conversions, more success from the kicking tee will be required in tighter matches, but will hope to kick on as the season comes to the boil in the run up to Christmas.Ballynahinch Buccaneers AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Reception for Shine charity to recognise group’s work  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council hosted a reception last to highlight the work of Shine, a UK wide charity which provides specialist advice and support for spina bida and hydrocephalus in the council area.The councilrsquos vice-chairperson, Osanka McMahon, expressed her admiration for the members and families of Shine and thanked Shine staff for their invaluable contribution.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Leo Varadkar He was responding to comments made by Mr Varadkar on Saturday, in which he claimed that Brexit is undermining  years of peace in Northern Ireland.Speaking on RTE Radio One’s Marian Finucane programme, the taoiseach said: “Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and it is fraying relationships between Britain and Ireland.“Anything that pulls the two communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship.”His comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar’s government of “riding roughshod” over the  agreement.   UUP leader Robin Swann Responding to the Irish premier’s remarks, Mr Swann said: “The tone of the language coming from Leo Varadkar at the weekend is, at best, disappointing and, at worst, a deliberate attempt to heighten tensions. “His words and tone are in direct contradiction to the approach adopted by his own Foreign Minister Simon Coveney at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.“If not handled properly, Brexit could undermine relationships between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, but I certainly didn’t expect the prime minister of the Republic to be directly involved in attempting to enhance the deterioration of those relationships. His words have a direct impact in Northern Ireland and not in a positive sense. “Instead of grandstanding to a domestic audience with one eye on an Irish general election, the taoiseach should start listening and taking advice rather than attempting to put his spin on the negotiations.” Backing Lord Trimble’s comments, Mr Swann added: “Whenever a Nobel peace prize winner tells the taoiseach that his government is riding roughshod over the Belfast Agreement, perhaps it’s time he started listening instead of talking. Perhaps it’s time he started concentrating on getting a deal for the benefit of everyone.”Serious assault: Man suffers suspected broken leg Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

has said the party is considering potentially running candidates in local elections in Northern Ireland.Brendan Howlin said he had written to SDLP leader Colum Eastwood last week seeking clarication about a possible merger between Fianna Fail and the SDLP.Fianna Fail, which is currently the main opposition party in the Irish Republic, is currently in talks with the SDLP and is expected to run a number of candidates in next years elections.Speaking at the culmination of the Labour Partys national conference Mr Howlin said he would like to hold discussions with members of the SDLP to see how they \"could construct a slate of candidates that would allow people who want to express Labour values to have the option of voting for Labour candidates\".Mr Howlin said his party had worked with the SDLP \"as comrades\" within the Party of European Socialists for decades.\"I think there are an awful lot of people in the SDLP who remain very loyal to Labour values,\" he said.\"Thats what brought them into the SDLP in the first instance and I dont think they should be abandoned to simply have to join Fianna Fail.\"In a bizarre set of events last month Fianna Fail had to insist it had not selected any candidates to stand despite a member of the partys ruling executive maintaining Sorcha McAnespy had been chosen as a candidate to run in next years local government poll.Flanked by frontbench Fianna Fail TD Eamon O Cuiv and party senator Mark Daly, Ms McAnespy was unveiled as a Fianna Fail \"candidate\".But on the same evening as she was being unveiled as a candidate at a meeting in Omagh the parliamentary party said it had not selected anyone to run for election.Ms McAnespy claims party leader Micheal Martin had personally told her she had been chosen as a candidate.In a speech to Labour party delegates in Dublin on Saturday night Mr Howlin said the Labour party would step in to ensure a \"pluralist option\" was available to voters in Northern Irelandthe merger between the SDLP and Fianna Fail went ahead.The Wexford TD said the Labour party wanted a \"New Ireland\" where everyone on the island of Ireland had a decent standard of

late Lord Laird areLady Laird, William Smart, worshipful master LOL  and Graham Barton, treasurer LOL . Pics by Graham Baalham-Curry During the service, a portrait of the former politician and PR man was unveiled by his we, Lady Carol Laird. The artwork was specially commissioned by Royal York LOL , of which Lord Laird was a member for over  years.The -year-old, who died in July following illness, was an active and well-known member of the Orange Order in Belfast throughout his le.He was also a founder and active member of Boyne Obelisk Lodge LOL , and the Houses of Parliament Lodge at Westminster.Paying tribute at the thanksgiving service, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Rev Mervyn Gibson, described Lord Laird as “someone special” and a “true friend” to all.“Many descriptions were used to describe John Laird at the time of his passing by those who knew him. A gentleman a committed Unionist a wind-up merchant an inspiration an Orangeman to the core a proud Ulsterman visionary and lateral thinker. But foremost of all these descriptions was a great dad and a loving husband,” he said.“We meet as Orange brethren and friends to honour him and give thanks to God for the privilege of knowing John. It is at home that John’s loss will always be most acutely felt, and our prayers, thoughts and sympathy remain with Carol, Alison and David.”Rev Gibson, a personal friend of Mr Laird, recalled the peer’s political career and public service, as well as highlighting his pioneering work in public relations and as an advocate for the local Ulster-Scots sector.“We all will recall how John was extremely generous generous with his time, generous in sharing his experience and expertise. Generous to a fault. It was our privilege to have known him,” Rev Gibson added.The service was conducted by Rev Iain Jameson, assistant grand chaplain, and incorporated music and performances, highlighting Lord Laird’s association with the Ulster-Scots movement.Tributes were also paid by Mervyn Bishop, the Orange Order’s imperial grand secretary, and Ulster-Scots enthusiast Maynard Hanna.Arson attack: Four people lucky to escape injury after petrol bomb thrown at house Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Military personnel, veterans and family members gathered at St Annes Cathedral for the Royal Irish Regiments annual service of remembrance. Pic by Matt Bohill, Pacemaker The Service of Choral Evensong, which featured music from The Band of The RIR, included an act of remembrance and laying of wreaths. It was attended by all ranks of the regiment and a number of veterans and bereaved families.Giving the address, the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, the Most Revd Dr Richard Clarke, said it was “a genuine privilege” to have been invited to preach at a service for a regiment with such “a distinguished history”.He spoke about human dignity in the context of remembrance and the reality of hope and peace through following and experiencing the presence of Jesus Christ.Taking his theme from the RIR’s regimental motto ‘Faugh a Ballagh’ , the Archbishop highlighted its resonance with swords being beaten into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks: “This was the honest hope of many who volunteered to fight in the First World War, that this was a war that would destroy war for all time.” “Clearing the way’, in biblical terms, is not simply about retaining our humanity even in the most terrible of circumstances, in the horrors, deprivations and torments of violence. It takes us further. It is also about clearing the way for a future that is better than what we wish to leave behind,” he said.He recalled how the war poet Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action  years ago to the day, affirmed humanity even in the midst of the war that would claim his le.“Owen’s most important contribution, not simply to poetry but to our understanding of war even one hundred years later, was his determination that humans should never lose their humanity, regardless of the dreadfulness of their circumstances, even in the mud and terror of war that he was experiencing at first-hand,” he continued.The Archbishop concluded: “‘Clear the way’ has of course a distinctive military meaning – removing whatever is obstructing an advance. But it has, as I have suggested, a spiritual dimension as well. Clearing from ourselves all that stands between us and the le that we could live, the le that allows us to reach our full potential, our full stature – as the Scriptures put it – as children of God.”Brexit: UUP ‘disappointment’ over Leo Varadkar’s tone Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought.

Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre.
