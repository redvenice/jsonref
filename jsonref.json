It also owns popular personalised greetings card website Moonpig. It opened the doors to its Paris factory in 2005, after merging with its French counterpart, Photoways. The company offers a range of products including personalised calendars, canvases and mugs - but the star of the show is their photo books, an album of photos created by the customer.           The Photobox factory, based on the outskirts of Paris, has to hire 250 extra staff for ChristmasThis is what the Paris factory specialises in and to support the tremendous demand for these albums in the run up to Christmas, the factory is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A whopping 18,000-21,000 photo books are produced every day over the peak period – four times more than what is created daily throughout the rest of the year.   The extra 250 workers are hired in October to leave plenty of time for them to be expertly trained up before the Christmas rush.           Close up: Our reporter, Grace, takes a look at the photo books before they have been coveredClaude Hanocq, the production director of France and Spain, who conducts the tour of the factory, said that not only does this mean there is more staff to look after, but the logistics of the whole factory have to be adjusted.He said: \u0027The cafeteria has to be moved from where it usually is, to a bigger room, so that there is enough room for everyone.\u0027We also need to make sure that everyone is in the right place at the right time. It is a big operation.\u0027 Before the tour, Claude proudly shows off a mug that has the record for the most amount of photo books made in a day printed on its side.  The record was set in December 2016 when an impressive 27,715 photo books were made. Claude said confidently: \u0027I think we\u0027ll beat that this year though.\u0027 How the photo book process worksThe huge factory floor is bustling with hundreds of members of staff hard at work, operating large machines.           Printing room: Looking at the printers that can print around 100-200 pictures a minuteIn the printing room, they churn out around 100-200 pictures a minute.It is home to the largest amount of the HP Indigo roll-to-roll printing machines in any one room in Europe - no mean feat considering each of the large machines costs roughly £1million.The printers are, Claude claims, the best on the market and print four colours, which is more costly, but does mean that they come out much clearer.It is no surprise the factory has decided to splash out on expensive printers, as demand from the company is high with a total of 1.7million photo books  printed each year.  Once the images have been printed, the covers of the photo books are created. The inners and covers of the photo books are printed separately, so throughout the whole process, the two have to be placed side by side on a trolley, to ensure that they don\u0027t become separated.There is a total of 800 different combinations of photo books that customers can create, including soft and hard back options that can be personalised.          It has the largest amount of \u0027HP Indigo roll to roll\u0027 printing machines in any one room in EuropeUp to 40 orders will be handled every minute across the peak period as 11million photos are uploaded to the site each day. After the images are printed, they go through a vicious cutting machine, snipping them to size. Claude tells us to step back - it is powerful and could easily break a man\u0027s leg. The images are then bound together into a book, before going through yet another machine that glues the cover onto it. A barcode  is then stuck on the book, which is passed over to an employee who conducts a rigorous quality check.The worker scans the barcode, which tells them exactly what should be included in the photo book and checks that there are no glaring errors and  the cover is in good condition.      \u0027The care we have for customers is what makes us stand out from the crowd from our competitors. \u0027We\u0027ve been going for years now and we are determined to make quality products that our customers will love for years to come.\u0027This renewed energy in the company has been helped along by it releasing 95 new products this year, including an artist collection, their first range of gallery quality prints.      It doesn\u0027t look like the company is slowing down as Photobox Group has now expanded to own five standalone brands, including Photobox, Hofmann, Moonpig, posterXXl and Greetz - the Dutch equivalent of Moonpig.  The group acquired Moonpig, which was responsible for 90 percent of the online greeting card market in the United Kingdom in 2007, in July 2011 for £120million in a cash and shares transaction.Looking forward to the future, the group is hoping to grow even further and continue to break its own records.  Free online will writingUse code timfree at checkout*\u0026#xA3185 in vouchers to switch and stay"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/01/4C807E2600000578-0-image-m-23_1527207763269.jpg","title":"Dianas butler Paul Burrell tells Meghan Markle stay close Harry Sandringham","story":"    When Meghan Markle sits down with the rest of the royal family for their traditional Christmas dinner, it\u0027ll be like being transported into \u0027another reality\u0027, says Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell          The Duchess of Sussex should prepare herself for an intense four days at the Sandringham estate, which will be \u0027occupied by some of the biggest personalities and egos in the country\u0027, says Burrell Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen and butler to Diana for a total of 21 years, feels great sympathy for the baptism of fire that Markle, 37, has so far faced. Although this will be nothing compared to what will hit her on Christmas Eve when she travels up to the country estate in Norfolk, England.Burrell explains that the festive period has always been used by the royal members to curry favor with the monarch and Meghan should seize the opportunity to talk to Her Majesty about what\u0027s on her mind after a tumultuous few months where she\u0027s been saddled as \u0027difficult\u0027 and blamed for a rift with sister-in-law Kate Middleton.          Burrell, who served as a footman to the Queen and butler to Diana for a total of 21 years, feels great sympathy for the baptism of fire that Markle, 37, has so far facedBurrell said: \u0027It\u0027s the most intense period of the year, I\u0027ve been there for so many Christmases, this house is occupied by some of the biggest personalities and egos in the country. \u0027All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than life, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and they\u0027re bouncing off the walls after four days. It\u0027s like a pinball machine.\u0027They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, it\u0027s the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression.\u0027It\u0027s what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. \u0027The best time to do it is when she\u0027s seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and she\u0027ll always ask people to join her, that\u0027s your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what you\u0027re thinking and feeling.\u0027That\u0027s the time Meghan should grasp, don\u0027t be talking dresses and jewels with other royals, head for the Queen. The Queen is the most humble, approachable and kind person you\u0027ll ever meet, she\u0027s a great listener, nothing will shock her, she\u0027s heard everything, and you can tell her everything, and it will be safe.\u0027The Queen has to be informed from the horse\u0027s mouth, if you don\u0027t do that, you\u0027re doing an injustice, I hope that Meghan will get this advice from Harry, that granny knows best. \u0027If you speak your fears, she will take it onboard and speak to the right person.

But sentencing was delayed for a year, after Kiseliova unsuccessfully tried to withdraw her guilty plea.    Some of the dogs, which included French and English bulldogs, were found trapped locked in cagesThe pair fled the country, where they are believed to be hiding in Eastern Europe. An European Arrest Warrant has been issued.At Manchester Crown Court Kiseliova was sentenced to four years jail and Titas got three and a half years imprisonment. They will be ordered to serve half their sentences once they are located.Sentencing the pair in their absence, Judge Richard Mansell QC said: \u0027These offences arose out of the running of the company Pets313 from your home address from December 2012. Two puppy traffickers who made £300,000 selling designer...Germans can choose a THIRD gender - allowing people to be...Share this article\u0027During that period 729 animals, 341 dogs and 388 cats, were in receipt of a Pet Plan which came with free insurance for 28 days.\u0027They travelled from Europe into the UK frequently and you abused the Pet Passport scheme which states the pets have been examined by vets and vaccinated before travelling to reduce the risk of diseases such as rabies.\u0027The majority of the dogs came from Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Belarus and Poland and you had people who would bring the dogs back in multiples of up to five at once.\u0027You detected customers and mislead them by making false representations to tell them the business had been approved by the Kennel Club.  The RSPCA said they found \u0027cages and pens containing different breeds of dogs in almost every room\u0027 when they raided the couple\u0027s home\u0027Many customers made purchases of sums from £100 to £1,000, and the dogs they purchased had health problems from the moment they got home.\u0027On December 12th, Jason Marshall bought his wife a pug for Christmas, he paid you £800 for that pug, which he named Coco.\u0027He was told he received vaccinations and was cared for by way of the Puppy pack. But Coco became ill and was taken to the local vets where she was examined and it was revealed she had lung problems, problems with her hips and she had to have a hernia removed.\u0027He said he wished he never had purchased her from you because she was so ill when he bought her.\u0027Gemma Walker bought a French bulldog from you called Bella. You met her before the purchase and showed her a pet pack which stated she had been to the vets, she left and paid £720.\u0027She asked for further medical notes, to which you asked for £500 extra payment for them.          The charity said a number of animals, including these cats, left and right, needed urgent veterinary treatment\u0027When she was taken home Miss Walker realised she wasn\u0027t breathing properly and called you, to which you told her that the dog wasn\u0027t your problem anymore.\u0027Taking Bella to the vet, Miss Walker was told the tablets she was giving her dog, prescribed by you, were for humans and once analysis was undertaken of the microchip, they discovered the dog was from Denmark and had a number of physical health problems.\u0027Miss Walker was back and forth to the vet numerous times and paid over £4,500 in vets bills.\u0027When the RSPCA came to your address they discovered animals kept in cages with little stimulation for space to run around. Two bulldogs that were rescued unfortunately died within a few days because they were in such ill health.\u0027No dogs with infections were kept in isolation, and hence this made other dogs infected. Puppies were kept in cages in the bedroom upstairs and some were kept in crates in the garage.\u0027The treatment of those animals was nothing short of appalling. They put their desire and greed before the welfare of animals.          Customers reported the dogs\u0027 health rapidly deteriorated after they were taken home - having been kept in squalid, cramped conditions since birth\u0027This was sophisticated offending which you involved others in and was over a substantial period of time. They made just over £300,000.\u0027They were driven solely by your greed. The conditions the animals were kept in were appalling, keeping them in crowded cages. Many were in pain and your treatment of them was utterly shameful.\u0027Speaking on behalf of Titas, his lawyer Stella Massey said: \u0027It does not bode well that Mr Titas is not here. I have met Mr Titas before.\u0027He did not come to the UK with the intention of finding himself in the position he was when he was arrested. He was working as a mechanic, working 12 hour days. He wasn\u0027t manipulated at court. He was the director of the company, but it was not his idea to set up the company.\u0027It was the co defendant who met with the customers and set up the website. He was directed by her when they needed taking to the vets or feeding. He had long term employment as a mechanic.\u0027He was working long hours six days a week, he was working towards his level three qualifications in mechanics. He comes from a stable and supportive background.\u0027A lifetime order under the Animal Welfare Act was placed on them, disqualifying them frown owning or looking after animals.Speaking after the case, the investigating officer for Trading Standards, Mr Gareth Hollinsworth, said: \u0027We received intelligence that animals were being sold illegally at an address in Salford in January 2013.\u0027We went to the address and met with the female defendant. She said she was acting as an interpreter for the male defendant but was giving more information that was the male was.\u0027We left the address and began receiving more intelligence and complaints which linked back to the address, so we contacted the RSPCA.\u0027We found evidence of animals in the property and we arrested them. Now there is a European arrest warrant out for them and it\u0027s out of our hands unfortunately.\u0027She is the most calculating and manipulative person I\u0027ve met. People went to her house and she knew she was going to sell them something.\u0027People bought an animals thinking they were rescuing them, but they weren\u0027t.\u0027We want to send out a message to people who are thinking of buying a pet this Christmas, it\u0027s a choice that you must keep for many years. Don\u0027t click and collect.\u0027Please do your research. Make sure the buyer is regulated with the local authority. Make sure you know which animal you are getting.

Well, it would mean the current uncertainty we all find distressing would be magnified rather than resolved.Our car makers – the centre-piece of our manufacturing industry, who depend heavily on exports to the EU – would face short term disruption and long term uncertainty about their ability to compete. Our airlines and freight hauliers and retailers would all find it difficult to guess what would become of their businesses.For the sake of all our futures, this mustn’t be allowed to happen when we have the power to prevent it. I acknowledge we should make preparations just in case. But I will do everything in our power to find a constructive solution.In order to protect the country from the short and long term disruption of a no-deal exit, we need to find a plan that a majority in Parliament can support. It’s something that’s eluded us. The Prime Minister had to put her proposal on hold because it would have been defeated.I support the PM’s deal, because it can deliver Brexit and allow us to move forward. But many of my colleagues aren’t yet persuaded. It’s possible enough will be – but they might not.We need to acknowledge the risk that Parliament could spend the next precious few months debating about preferred solutions and end up with no compromise, no agreement and no deal.So what’s to be done?We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus.

It means taking a more practical, sensible and healing approach. These may not be words to make the heart beat faster, or fill the soul with excitement – but they are what’s needed in a country that has seen everything from families to political parties split down the middle and that now needs some Brexit certainty.It also requires everyone to abandon outrage and accusations. It’s not weak to create a safe environment for Parliament to find a solution – it’s strong.There may be lost votes along the way as we edge towards a solution, but so be it. Each one will help us get to something that is workable and possible.There will be those outside Parliament that say this approach is naïve. Others may call it treachery. My colleagues across the House of Commons should ignore such siren voices calling us to the rocks of no deal.This is a great country. I believe it can have a fantastic post-Brexit future – but only if politicians are willing to try a different way and only if a coalition of those who want what’s best for this country argue a little less and compromise a little more.If we don’t start having these grown up conversations we also risk stumbling into a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour Government. "},{"url":null,"title":"Secret society crafters decorate postboxes woolly hats","story":"    Baa humbug?

Then he looks again and apologises — the names have been hastily written and he has misread ‘Mr S. Flannigan’ as ‘Mrs Flannigan’. Family friend Bill Harley puts a comforting arm around Steven and leads him away.10pmMany residents are discovering bodies around their homes. Bunty Galloway finds a boy lying on her garden steps. Not realising he is dead, she places a lambswool travel rug over him ‘to keep him warm’.More than 3,000 miles away, Susan and Daniel Cohen are driving to JFK Airport.

She can’t think of any alternative distraction.Her 20-year-old step-daughter Miriam was one of the students travelling home. Rosemary knows it’s irrational to be dusting, but friends and family will be coming round soon and she wants the house tidy.10.30pmPolice have set up a temporary mortuary in the basement of Lockerbie town hall. A farmer in a pick-up truck pulls up.The police help him unload debris, then notice someone fast asleep in the passenger seat wrapped in a coat. They think it is the farmer’s son, then realise it is the body of a young boy.The Cohens arrive at JFK’s Pan Am terminal. Dan abandons the car, engine still running.Inside, they are escorted through a crush of cameras to the Clipper Class Lounge on the first floor. Downstairs, the parents of Nicole Boulanger, 21, are told the plane has crashed. Jeannine Boulanger collapses on the floor screaming: ‘Oh, my baby!’11pmAmbulances are lined up along Lockerbie’s main street, but there is no use for them. There are no survivors from the plane and all the Lockerbie injured have already been taken to hospital.At a phonebox nearby, a queue of journalists wait to dictate their reports of the disaster to their newsrooms.At the town hall mortuary, a weeping farmer brings in the body of a three-year-old girl in a red dress.

When they ask him about his wife, he says quietly: ‘If she’s all right, she’ll ken where to find me.’1.30amSteven Flannigan is staying the night at the home of his friend Bill Harley. As he lies in the spare room, Steven’s heart is beating so fast it’s making his breathing uneven. It will be a week before a social worker officially tells him his parents and sister are dead, but he already realises the terrible truth.2amDr Keith Little of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, one of the medics searching Sherwood Crescent, is finding bodies with metal embedded in them. He is convinced an explosion must have brought the plane down.5.30amIn Maryland, Rosemary Mild’s home is full of friends and family who have come to support her and husband Larry.She has been trying to get through to Pan Am for seven hours for news of their daughter Miriam. Finally, a Pan Am agent answers. Rosemary asks: ‘Was my daughter on Flight 103?’ ‘There’s an M. Wolfe on the manifest,’ the agent says brusquely.It’s a common name, so for a moment Rosemary has hope it’s not her daughter. Then the agent gives the contact number they have for Miriam — her London flat. Rosemary hangs up and doubles up in pain. She whispers to her husband to ask their friends to leave. All she can think is, ‘They all have their children.’Five months later Rosemary will receive Miriam’s suitcase. It is dented, but inside are her clothes, which have been lovingly washed and ironed by women in Lockerbie.Among the clothes is a Christmas star for their family tree.          Search parties roamed the nearby fields in search of anyone who may have survived the attack. One man has described how they mainly found body parts7.50amAs dawn breaks, the scale of the disaster is clear for the first time — 120 bodies have been found, but the search continues.A policeman searching fields at Tundergarth near the plane’s nose section sees a woman’s face staring up at him from a pool of peaty water. Nine other bodies are found later in the marsh. 9amGeoffrey Leeming is flying his Wessex helicopter over the fields around Tundergarth. From his cockpit, he can see bodies scattered across the fields. Each body has a policeman standing watch next to them.10amSearching the fields near their home, farmer’s sons Stuart and Robbie Dodd spot a long piece of metal with a box attached to it. On its side is printed ‘DATA REPRODUCER 1972’ — it’s the Digital Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder of Pan Am 103.MiddayAll morning, local residents have been coming into Yvonne and Jimmy Haldane’s shop on Mains Street to buy something, then forgetting what it was they wanted. The Haldanes know this is a classic symptom of shock.1pmOn their sheep farm eight miles outside Lockerbie, Hugh and Margaret Connell are keeping watch over the body of a dark-haired man.Earlier, the Connells asked a rescue team if they could take the man to their home out of the biting cold, but were told the body could not yet be moved.The Connells keep their vigil for 24 hours. Later they will discover that the passenger they called ‘our boy’ was 45-year-old Frank Ciulla, who was on his way home to his wife and three children. The way the Connells cared for Frank provides some comfort for the Ciullas.9pmThe phone rings in the Philadelphia home of Dr Perry Dornstein. An agent from Pan Am asks: ‘Is this the family of David Dornstein?’ Perry says it is, and the agent says: ‘Things are a little confused. Could you please hold?’ Dionne Warwick’s song Do You Know The Way To San Jose? then plays down the phone.David, 25, has been living in Israel for a year, and the family aren’t expecting him until later this week. But David had decided to surprise his family and come home early — on Flight 103.As the agent breaks the news to Perry, his son’s body is lying under a collapsed wall in Ella’s garden. It will be found by a sniffer dog in four days.

It is from the passenger on the Frankfurt flight with whom three-year-old Suruchi Rattan had chatted. The flowers come with a note: ‘To the little girl in the red dress who made my flight from Frankfurt so much fun: you didn’t deserve this.’AftermathOn January 4, 1989, 100 relatives who lost loved ones gathered in Lockerbie’s parish church. Later, a memorial listing the names of all the victims was erected in the cemetery.Six weeks after the disaster, the search for bodies ended. 259 passengers and crew and 11 Lockerbie residents had been killed.One week after the crash, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found traces of explosive. A thousand police and Army personnel began a fingertip search of the countryside that recovered more than 10,000 items.In 2001, Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the only person convicted of the bombing, was sentenced to life in prison.He was released on compassionate grounds in 2009 and died of cancer in 2012."},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE mothers grief Facebooks abject lack humanity","story":"    Anna England Kerr, 30, says is being bombarded with adverts aimed at new parents six months after she gave birth to a stillborn daughterNest-making for a new child is the most joyful, exciting and natural project for any mother-to-be.Decorating the baby’s room, buying the cot and the mobiles to hang above it, the pram and soft blankets — it’s a time of unbridled optimism at the prospect of the new arrival.But tragically, for more than 3,000 British women every year who suffer the horror of a stillbirth, all that hope turns to ashes. Without a child to take home, with no little arms and legs to pop into those gorgeous babygrows, every thing they’ve painstakingly prepared becomes a hateful reminder of who they’ve lost.Few have suffered more than Anna England Kerr, 30, who was 38 weeks pregnant when her baby Clara was stillborn. Yet her heartbreak was made so much worse because on her arrival home she was bombarded on social media with adverts aimed at new mums.An ad for a baby toy made her ‘feel like someone has shoved a knife inside you and torn it through you,’ she said. ‘I thought I’m never going to buy that for Clara . . . it sends you into freefall.’Despite contacting Facebook directly to say she had lost her baby, still the torment poured in: a promotion for post-maternity clothes, another asking if the ‘little one’ had started weaning. Seven months on, Facebook says it is still trying to resolve her ‘problem’.I’m sorry, but it is not Anna who has a ‘problem’. It is Facebook and the utterly heartless world of social media.  Some of the adverts Ms England Kerr saw included a Cow \u0026amp Gate post (left) and an advert for a crib (right) A world where companies hellbent on making a quick buck harvested private data with such precision they knew exactly when Anna was expected home with her baby — and yet were so callous they couldn’t even be bothered to find out whether her child was alive.It’s a world where people have been replaced by computer programs and algorithms, a world shorn of all humanity.What makes Facebook’s behaviour even more unconscionable is that its boss Mark Zuckerberg has spoken movingly about his heartbreak over the three babies he and his wife Priscilla lost before they finally had their longed-for family.Perhaps this Christmas he could apply a tiny part of his huge brain on how to stop his company inflicting agonies on people like Anna through its greed and lack of compassion.  Not so handy AndieWhat a treat that Comic Relief is screening a sequel to Four Weddings And A Funeral.

A long-time insomniac, he appears to have been searching for the silver lining of a condition that, in chronic form, can suck the lifeblood from you.One does not have to try hard to build the case against insomnia – the way its vampire clutch leaves just a hollow shell of you to ghost walk through your days the way it trips you up and compromises your cognitive integrity. But Aldiss was after compensation. The “great attraction of insomnia”, he observed, is that “the night seems to release a little more of our vast backward inheritance of instinct and feelings as with the dawn, a little honey is allowed to ooze between the lips of the sandwich, a little of the stuff of dreams to drip into the waking mind.”Before I began writing a book about my own insomnia, I wouldn’t have paid Aldiss any heed, much less the id that seemed to hold sway over my darkened bedroom. Whatever wisps of a dream managed to seep into my conscious brain offered nothing in the way of solace. Instead I felt enervated and defeated. My bad nights came with no honeyed sweeteners.Insomnia’s symptoms will be familiar to anyone who has been forced into an intimate acquaintance with the witching hours. Awake all night, I feel saturated with dread, with a gut-churning queasiness stemming from an all-pervading sense of doom. As the minutes and hours tick by, I squirm and thrash and toss, trying not to look at the clock, until, giving up on sleep altogether, I get up. So it goes, night after endless night. Like Wordsworth, who complained of not being able to win sleep “by any stealth”, I have long been exasperated by sleep’s refusal to visit me, no matter how avidly I court it. My mind will not quieten, will not release my body and allow it to sink into sleep, obeying the gravitational pull of the unconscious.Marcel Proust, one of literature’s great insomniacs, eerily captures how the sleepless mind misbehaves, tracing fretful loops, tying itself into epistemological knots, the way it grows confused and then suddenly certain. In the first book of In Search of Lost Time, he describes lying awake, convinced he has fallen into someone else’s waking dream. He imagines he has been reading about his own life in a book and that all his thoughts come second-hand from print. When eventually he realises that, in fact, he is in his own bed, he cannot distinguish his recollections from his illusions.Mathias Énard’s extraordinary novel Compass, shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker international prize, is a conscious homage to Proust. The book is set during a single sleepless night, when Énard’s largely auto-fictional narrator, an Austrian academic and orientalist, pines for the unrequited love of his life – a one-time protege who overtook him. As he tosses and turns, frustrated by his enduring pent-up lust, he wallows in recollections of their many encounters at conferences, their late night tête-à-têtes in restaurants, their mutual passion for the literature and music of the Middle East.Énard conjures very well the exquisite torture of having nowhere to hide from your failings in insomnia, of having to sit with those agitated, uncertain, spiritually naked thoughts for as long as it takes for them to leach away. At one point he bemoans jolting awake from fevered dreams without ever having slept, before trying to convince himself that “a man trying to fall asleep turns over and finds a new point of departure, a new beginning”.The American novelist Blake Butler’s description of insomnia’s treacherous ways in his 2012 memoir, Nothing, is even more harrowing. Lying awake in bed, everything looms with menace. He feels the pressure of the words spilling from the philosophical books that crowd his shelves, and the coffin-like oppression of his bedroom: throughout his childhood he was haunted by a recurring dream that filled him with a choking terror, of a vast boulder slowly descending on to him through his bedroom ceiling.At one point in 1964, Nabokov, caught up in the maverick theories of the British aeronautical engineer John W Dunne – who argued that time was not linear but recursive – became convinced that his own dreams could intercept time’s backflow and prise open a portal to the future. Nabokov began recording his dreams, diligently describing their shifting locations their elusive characters and scripts. He was looking out for scenes, however brief or prosaic, that somehow prefigured his later waking experiences, since on Dunne’s model they would qualify as pre-cognitive, oracular.This kind of seeing in the dark has long been cherished in prophecy. The earliest Greek oracles were “shrines to night”. Ancient heroes who wished to grasp the truth of things had to pass through underworlds, or dwell in caves sometimes, like Oedipus, they could see clearly only once they had been blinded. After Athena blinds Tiresias for spying on her when she is naked she gives him the gift of augury, while the seer Phineus chooses blindness over sight. In each instance, truth, not light, is the source of illumination for the darkened seer.In ancient Egypt, seekers after spiritual guidance could spend a night in incubation, which was a special institutionalised sleep undertaken in the temples of the gods precisely in order to descry meaning in the dark. Not unlike poets, they saw themselves as human lightning rods, privileged recipients of ine revelation. The poet after all longs to be a seer – the one awake enough to see things for what they are amid a world given over to slumber, and name them or call them out.This is the ambition that Emily Brontë voices in her poem “Stars”, when she begs the twinkling deities to hide her from the sun’s hostile light: “Let me sleep through his blinding reign,  And only wake with you!” Brontë is famed for having experienced visions at night. Greedily, she invoked sleeplessness as the source of her imagination. But even she eventually tired of night-waking. Ritually, she would walk around her bedroom each night, desperate to fall asleep.Should we trust the poet’s apparent second sight, given that insomnia does not merely reverse day and night, but turns everything on its head, inverting the world and conflating its cardinal points “where left is always right”, as Bishop puts it in her poem “Insomnia”? Insomnia is guilty, too, of profound exaggeration. It floods its sufferers with a delusional sense of their own mental powers. I cannot be the only writer who, gripped by an idea in the small hours, reaches for her notebook and pours her thoughts on to the page, only to have to reckon by light of morning with the miserable banality of her night-time output.And it is not just writers who overestimate their cognitive prowess when sleep deprived numerous studies conducted on nightworkers – taxi drivers, junior doctors – reveal that in insomnia the mind cannot be trusted. Or can it?In an interview she gave to the Paris Review in 2016, the poet Linda Pastan, now in her 80s, says: “while I’m lying in the dark, the solution to a problem I’ve been struggling with in a poem actually, and magically, comes to me”. For Pastan, insomnia is “a struggle with consciousness itself”.I try to take solace from Pastan’s words – to warm to the ineffable romance of night’s essential mystery. I remember that on certain calm nights I think of as velvety, I feel as if I could reach out and touch the stars. Though I’m not religious, I experience an openness or porosity, a wash of wellbeing.Perhaps, then, the creative impulse more closely resembles an inner awakening, rather than a keenness of sight. Or maybe there’s a bit of both in the mix – looking, as Keats says, “with eternal lids apart”, while also searching the soul’s inner darkness to unearth one’s deepest dreads, longings and revelations. Philip Larkin, in “Aubade”, writes of waking at four and, until dawn finally arrives, seeing only what is always there: “Unresting death”. But the Italian poet Umberto Saba in “Insomnia on a Summer Night” writes about being “sick with insomnia,  a religious pleasure”.Franz Kafka who, like Nabokov and Proust, welcomed insomnia as an opportunity to explore the strange twilight realms between dreaming and waking, confided in his diary that if he couldn’t “pursue stories through the nights, they break away and disappear”. Colette called insomnia “an oasis in which those who have to think or suffer darkly take refuge”. More recently, Stephen King revealed that the plot of Misery came to him in a dream, during a fitful bout of sleep snatched on a plane.It seems undeniable that Aldiss was on to something when he wrote of the unconscious mind dripping its contents into consciousness. The Mexican poet Octavio Paz made a similar claim, referring to the “invisible bridges between sleep and waking”, when the murmur of ideas flows around our sleepy heads, whispering, intimating, connecting. Under conditions like this, a bad night might not, after all, lack compensation. The key, it seems, is being aware enough of the process – awake enough – to make sense of it.Last year, as the months went by and I fell deeper into my book, I noticed that the tendrils of daytime clarity began to extend themselves into the night if I focused enough in my insomnia, I found that, often, I was able to grab hold of them. And so, when I got up before dawn, I began to use those bone-white hours to write. It is hard to say how much of the resulting book owes its final form to insomnia, but since I was writing about the condition, it seems only fitting that night merged with day in the act of producing it.We are so geared towards the day – towards the neon bright of consciousness – that we tend to neglect the dark: open your eyes in the depths of night and the initial feeling is often one of panic. But if you wait, and watch, your eyes slowly adapt and you begin to discern shadows. Hold your nerve, and the shadows might just resolve into definite shapes. • Insomnia by Marina Benjamin is published by Scribe.

After 19 novels ning Nigeria to Ethiopia, he shares what he learnedAt last year’s  Opinion Christmas party – modest affairs at which those who want to dance are outnumbered by those who want to talk by at least five to one – I met Chibundu Onuzo, a Nigerian author.“We share a publisher,” she told me.“I’m sorry,” I told her. “I haven’t read your book.”Chibundu waved away my apology with generous indifference. We carried on chatting and were among the pioneers on the dancefloor.Chibundu did not appear bothered by my ignorance of her work, but I was. I can’t say exactly why. There are lots of books I haven’t read. But in some small way that gnawed at me in the days ahead, I wondered not only why I hadn’t read her but why she wasn’t on my radar.Feeling it was time to fix my radar, I decided, when it came to fiction, to read only African women for a year. The motivation was not virtue but curiosity. I wondered what I had been missing out on. I wasn’t completely ignorant of literature by women from that part of the world: I’d read Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head, Buchi Emecheta, Leila Aboulela, Gillian Slovo, Nadine Gordimer and Zoë Wicomb. Nor was I entirely ignorant of that part of the world. I lived in Sudan for a year, reported from South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sierra Leone and visited Ghana on holiday. But it had been at least four years since I read any of those authors and five since I set foot on the continent.Not so long ago my project would have been much harder. “It used to be just a few writers published mostly as part of an educational series,” explains Margaret Busby, editor of Daughters of Africa, the landmark anthology of writing by women of African descent, which came out in 1992. “Now they are in the mainstream. I think publishers can see the success they can have with someone like Chimamanda and of course they want that success too.”But it’s still not as easy as it might be. “Until you can no longer count the number of African women writers who have broken through then we’ve still got work to do,” says Busby, whose sequel, New Daughters of Africa, comes out next year.My original approach was not methodical. I just started with the books on my shelf, posted an appeal for recommendations on Facebook and then took the books I’d read and went to Amazon’s “Customers who viewed this item also viewed” section to see what else was out there. But when, by around Easter, it became clear that if I didn’t mix it up I could spend the whole year reading Nigerian women (no bad thing, just not my plan), I made an effort to seek out writers from various parts of the continent.With the year almost up I have read 19 books by authors from Morocco, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Egypt, Somalia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Cameroon and Guadeloupe. There have been love stories, short stories, multi-generational sagas, political novels, ghosts, infertility, coups, occupations and migration stories, written in the voices of white English men and women, first, second, third and fourth wives, children, slaves and slavers, ranging over four continents and in every century from the 16th onwards.The book most often recommended to me was Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, a 29-year-old Ghanaian American writer based in Berkeley. This debut novel from 2016, which won a slew of awards, is a saga ning the Atlantic and many generations. It starts in an 18th-century Asante village and follows the descendants of Maame, who has two daughters. One is married to the British governor running Cape Coast Castle the other, Esi, is enslaved in the dungeons below. Each chapter then follows their offspring, in Africa and the US. Panoramic in its scope, Gyasi’s book is a bold effort.But chances are I’d have appreciated it more if I hadn’t already come across two books that use the same device to greater effect. The first, Segu, tells the story of the eponymous west African kingdom as it fights to maintain its traditions and integrity against Christian, Muslim and foreign incursion and expansion. It starts in 1797, when “Segu was at the height of its glory. Its power stretched as far as the outskirts of Jenne ... and it was feared as far away as Timbuktu ... ” The book traces the lineage of Dousika Traore, the Segu king’s most trusted court adviser, through his four sons and beyond. Maryse Condé, 81, employs her historical knowledge with a light touch, building complex characters who are not reduced to vessels of a historical moment. Condé, the French winner of this year’s New Academy prize in literature (given in lieu of the Nobel prize), is the one writer included here who is not African. Momentarily distracted by the subject matter of Segu, which I already owned, by the time I remembered that she wasn’t African it didn’t matter – I was already hooked.The second, Kintu, is the first novel by Ugandan-born Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, who now lives in Manchester and was awarded a $150,000 Windham-Campbell literature prize this year. Kintu, published in the UK in January, is the story of a curse passed through generations in what is now Uganda. It starts with the mob killing of a man mistaken for a thief and then stretches back to the story of a powerful governor who unleashes a curse that reverberates through the ages when he kills his own son. Makumbi’s prose style is as haunting as the storyline. “Just as the sun moved into the centre of the sky to inflict its worst, o Lwera, a region of barren land came into view ... Even at this distance, a dirge, the hum of its heat, was audible. Waves of radiation danced in the air warning: You traverse these grounds at your own peril.”In his satirical 2006 Granta essay, How to Write About Africa, Binyavanga Wainaina advises: “Never have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel prize ... Taboo subjects: ordinary domestic scenes, love between Africans (unless a death is involved), references to African writers or intellectuals, mention of school-going children who are not suffering from yaws or Ebola fever or female genital mutilation.”There are plenty of portrayals of ordinary domestic scenes and love between Africans in this motley collection. But rare were the west African, and particularly Nigerian, works that did not find ample material in polygamy. If you think of how much drama English literature has managed to extract from monogamy, we probably shouldn’t be surprised. When African men write about polygamy it is generally treated, at best, as a problem to manage: keeping peace among the wives. But, not surprisingly, female authors engage with it differently. It is for the women to manage the humiliation, competition, jealousy and rancour brought about when a man invites another woman to share his bed and compound. A pecking order emerges among wives and children, in a range of abusive relationships between men and women, women and women and women and their children, producing rivalries that propel plots.The most tender of these accounts is also the shortest – the 95-page So Long a Letter, published in 1979, by the Senegalese author Mariama Bâ, who died aged 52 in 1981. The book takes the form of a letter from Ramatoulaye Fall to her best friend Aissatou on the death of Ramatoulaye’s husband Modou, who has abandoned her and their 12 children and taken one of their daughter’s best friends as his second wife.“And to think that I loved this man passionately,” writes Ramatoulaye. “To think that I gave him 30 years of my life, to think that 12 times over I carried his child. The addition of a rival to my life was not enough for him. In loving someone else, he burned his past, both morally and materially. He dared to commit such an act of disavowal.”In the more recent novels polygamy appears to pose a challenge to a sense of modernity, making its way from the urban centres towards the peripheries, particularly in Nigeria where, according to the Demographic and Health Survey 2008, a third of married women and one in eight married men (aged 15-49) are in polygamous unions.These dynamics are further complicated, or sometimes instigated, as the focus shifts from the bed to the uterus, and the guilt and desperation as women will their bodies to produce the one thing – often the only thing – that will legitimise both their marriage and their femininity: a child. It may take two to make a baby but fertility and fecundity are understood to be a woman’s responsibility not least because they represent the underpinnings of a man’s honour.This is the defining theme of The Secret Lives of Baba Segi’s Wives by Lola Shoneyin, the winner of several awards and longlisted for the Orange prize in 2011, in which Bolanle Alao, a graduate with a promising future, marries into a polygamous family as the fourth wife. Baba Segi’s role in the whole affair is almost incidental – the benign dictator in a state of emotional repression, his sexual endeavours are described in tragicomic detail. “Baba Segi was heavy,” relates one of his wives. “Everything about him was clumsy and awkward. He heaved and hoed, poured his water into me and collapsed onto my breasts.” Only Egyptian author, psychiatrist and physician Nawal El Saadawi’s depiction of Zakariah’s subservience to his “gland” in Zeina (2011) is more debasing. In Baba Segi’s house, however, the disgrace is Bolanle’s. Despised and ultimately feared by the other wives who try everything – including murder – to get rid of her, Bolanle struggles to conceive. The shame of being barren, the overbearing mother-in-law, the disappointed gaze that rests on a newly-wed’s flat stomach, the natural remedies and visits to traditional healers are constant features.“You have had my son between your legs for two more months and still your stomach is flat,” Moomi, the mother-in-law, tells the protagonist, Yejide in Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s excellent 2017 novel Stay With Me. “Close your thighs to him I beg you … If you don’t he will die childless. I beg you, don’t spoil my life. He is my first son, Yejide.”We follow Yejide through a phantom pregnancy, infant mortality and a second wife as Adébáyò builds a vivid cast of secondary characters who bear witness and contribute to the disintegration of her marriage.The Map of Love by Ahdaf Soueif is one of several books in which the more familiar tensions of monogamous relationships dominate, including Zeina, in which love is absent and others, like Aminatta Forna’s The Memory of Love (2010), which is tied together by a marriage that is unfulfilled, a romance that is incomplete and a courtship that reaches fruition. Soueif’s 1999 Booker shortlisted novel tracks the dual romances of an Egyptian American conductor and American journalist in the US during the 90s and an English widow and Egyptian doctor in Egypt at the beginning of the 20th century, and is the only one of these books in which romantic love drives the narrative completely.Stay With Me, like many of these stories, whether set in Egypt (Zeina and The Map of Love), Uganda (Kintu and Tropical Fish by Doreen Baingana), Zimbabwe (We Need New Names by NoViolet Bulawayo), Sierra Leone (The Memory of Love) or the US (Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue), uses political upheaval to provide an important, if somewhat incidental, backdrop. More often than not this is just an aside: “We were at Makerere University,” writes Baingana in her collection of intertwined short stories, “We were the cream of the crop. We had dodged the bullets of Amin, Obote, all the coups, the economic war, exile and return, and here we were on the road to success.”Only in Maaza Mengiste’s 2010 novel Beneath the Lion’s Gaze, set in Ethiopia during the downfall of Emperor Haile Selassie and the first years of the Dergue dictatorship, does politics dominate. Through the story of one family – Hailu, the doctor, his two sons, the religious Yonas and the rebellious Dawit, their partners and neighbours – we see the disintegration into a reign of terror. The depiction of inidual acts of morality and resistance – both major and minor, futile and fruitful – as a society descends into brutality and conformism is arresting even if all the characters except Hailu feel one-dimensional. “You want to save people,” Dawit’s revolutionary handler tells him after he tries to drag from the street the corpse of a woman he knows against a soldier’s orders. “Then save the living. Those who are dead aren’t worth dying for.”Unlike many black British novels, which often have a fractured timeline, only a few of those I read (Zeina, Kintu, The Memory of Love) shift between past and present. But many move geographically, offering migration stories either within the continent (Segu, Nadifa Mohamed’s Black Mamba Boy (2010), Homegoing) or beyond. Behold the Dreamers, Homegoing, Tropical Fish and We Need New Names take us to the US Segu to Brazil. Philosophically the authors of these books feel more comfortable in their skin than their diasporic counterparts in Europe and the US, who often work through their issues of belonging, discrimination and minority status through their fiction. Ethnic, tribal, religious and regional differences may make their protagonists question their place at home, but they don’t interrogate whether it’s home or not. That sense of confidence evaporates the longer they stay outside Africa.But perhaps the boldest and most arresting migration story of all is that offered by Laila Lalami’s 2014 novel The Moor’s Account (shortlisted for the Pulitzer prize, longlisted for the Booker), which tells the story of the calamitous New World expedition from Spain to Florida, from the point of view of Estabanico, a Moorish slave, to whom Lalami gives the original name Mustafa. Mustafa is one of just four from an original contingent of 300 who survive the journey after some are lost, others killed and a handful eaten by their fellow explorers. As the expedition proceeds, with all the brutality and arrogance such an imperial adventure entails, the numbers dwindle and the hierarchy between slave and master breaks down, threatening to reassert itself when the four finally find their way back to other Spanish colonists. “The rules and formalities that had existed on land could not be maintained on the rafts,” notes Mustafa. “Worse: our ablutions were no longer private ... But for one like me, who had already known these humiliations, it was a reminder that all fates, including my master’s, could turn upside down. And I would do whatever it took in order to right mine.”In a regular year my fiction choices are very hit and miss. I read non-fiction primarily for work and fiction for pleasure. Occasionally, prompted by reviews and more often by recommendations, I yank something off the shelf and give it a go. I come late to pretty much everything. Sometimes I try to improve myself with something I think I should have read – a classic Russian novel or recent prize winner – which rarely works out. If I have a default it’s to black western writers – the ones I’m most likely to see referred to in other work and refer to in my own. It’s a rare summer holiday that I don’t take a Walter Mosley with me. But last year I devoured Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See the year before, Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels. This year I’ve enjoyed more books than usual and encountered far fewer duds.Indeed one of the most delightful was Welcome to Lagos, by one Chibundu Onuzo. It follows Chike Ameobi, a military officer, who deserts the Nigerian army with his subordinate of few words, Yemi, after refusing to fire on civilians in the Niger delta. As they flee they bump into Fineboy, a slick character who fought with rebel groups Isoken, a 16-year-old girl whom they rescue from being raped by Fineboy and his fellow rebels and Oma, on the run from an abusive husband. Having found each other, this unlikely band of travellers sticks together through a series of adventures during which they sleep rough, squat in an apartment, imprison a corrupt minister, redistribute stolen money to schools, and eventually make a life for themselves in a beautifully spun yarn that I could not put down.Discovering these writers, new and old, who were hiding in plain sight has been a bit like coming across a new word – suddenly they pop up everywhere and you realise that somehow their presence never registered. With the year nearly up I feel much as I did after I gorged on books about Russia in my teens or the American south and the Harlem Renaissance in my 20s – I feel I need to see these places, particularly Nigeria and Uganda, that have been so vividly created for me. That’s why it intrigues me that, had I not embarked on this endeavour, I probably never would have read most of them. Wondering why that is, I’m reminded of what Maya Angelou the late African American writer said to me about her choice of romantic partners.“I could fall in love with a sumo wrestler if he told stories and made me laugh,” she said. “Obviously, it would be easier if someone was African American and lived next door and went to the same church. Because then I wouldn’t have to translate. But if I make the effort to learn the language and respect the mores then I should be able to get along anywhere and with any kind of people.

Since it was privatised, Royal Mail has shut more than 50 delivery offices and more closures are threatened as the company seeks to reduce costs.If your local office is under threat, you had better hope the process is better managed than the Dulwich debacle, say many in south London. In September, and despite a long campaign by the local MP backed by residents, Royal Mail closed its Silvester Road depot. Postal deliveries are now sorted and delivered at a much larger depot in Peckham, which is a 30-minute walk away. Undelivered parcels have to be collected from there too.The problems started almost immediately after the switch, say residents. They say they are lucky if they get one delivery a week. Important documents including a number of bank cards have gone missing. One Dulwich resident says six bank cards sent to her household have all failed to arrive. Postal workers have admitted to customers that they don’t have time to complete rounds, meaning some houses go unvisited for days on end.Those unlucky enough to miss a parcel delivery must head to Peckham to collect their items – an hour-long trip by bus – where they then say they face waits of up to an hour. They describe a chaotic office that was unable to cope even before the Christmas rush got going. Affected residents have bombarded Royal Mail bosses and their MP, Helen Hayes, with complaints.Money reader and Dulwich resident Serena James says the postal service in her area has collapsed. “Residents go days or even weeks without receiving any post at all, and countless items never arrive,” she says. “Numerous residents, including me, have had replacement credit and debit cards never arrive, only to find they have been used to make contactless payments in the Peckham area. When packages do arrive, they have sometimes already been opened. It has been utterly chaotic from the start. I have complained to Royal Mail, who claim to be investigating, but nothing is improving.”A long thread on the East Dulwich Forum site reveals the scale of the problems. Residents say valuable items have been left on doormats all day in full view of the street. Some report giving up on home delivery and asking for items to be sent to their workplace instead. Others use courier firms.Hayes says: “It has been a complete shambles, and is exactly what we predicted when we originally fought the closure of the office. Royal Mail would not listen and this has been the outcome. The nearby West Norwood office is also under threat of closure and, if that goes ahead, I predict the problems seen in East Dulwich will be dwarfed by that. Royal Mail needs to learn from this and think again.” A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: “At Peckham, we do believe the situation in the customer services point has improved. It is the busiest time of year and there are many more people picking up mail than normal. We have a dedicated manager working in the customer service point all through the festive season.“Royal Mail has to relocate offices from time to time, and there are a number of reasons for this. Sometimes leases expire and are not renewed.“Often it is driven by the change in the profile of the mail we deliver (more parcels, fewer letters) which means some of our delivery offices are no longer fit for purpose. Delivery offices may not, for example, have enough space to store parcels, or to park the vans we use for deliveries. Facilities for our people are sometimes not right for a 21st century workforce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156928da3ac2ad0a9cdf1769f62c46d9cb67d0aa/0_336_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d61025f6f2748c6822f0f7c0c68211cc","title":"second brexit referendum europe vote remain eu","story":"If it’s not Jacob Rees-Mogg, it’s Jean-Claude Juncker, the double-barrelled duo giving Theresa May both barrels within 24 hours of each other. No sooner had the monocled mutineer called for May to resign after she had seen off his motion of no confidence than the head of the EU commission was accusing the prime minister of being “nebulous”, as Europe’s heads of government refused to give her even a few crumbs of political comfort to take back home for Christmas. Rebuffed in both Westminster and Brussels, May is coming to resemble a figure from a medieval morality play, scorned and rejected wherever she turns.The result is that a bleak clarity is emerging from the Brexit fog. There is no majority in the Commons for May’s deal. And yet the deal will not be substantively improved by the EU. So Brexit is stuck, parliament’s minimum falling short of Brussels’ maximum. No deal is possible, which surely makes “no deal” possible.Except that MPs and ministers alike insist they will not allow the country to fall off a cliff, crashing out with no deal on 29 March. They have heard the words of the former head of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, warning Britons that to go from the European single market to trading on WTO terms will be like being demoted from the Premier League to the old fourth ision. Given all that, May – or someone else, if she cannot do it – will have to come up with something else.Which is why the probability of a second referendum, once the quixotic goal of a handful of unreconciled remainers, is increasing with each passing day. May doesn’t need to be persuaded by the democratic logic of seeking popular approval for Brexit as it actually exists, as opposed to the slogan-on-a-bus version the public voted on in 2016. All she needs to decide is that a referendum is her only way out of the current impasse.It’s not just Brexiteers, fearful of losing the prize they won against the odds two and a half years ago, who dislike that possibility. Plenty of remainers too are nervous about a contest they fear they could lose, thereby closing the door for good on a close relationship with Europe. And others, many of them Labour MPs in pro-leave seats, tremble at the sheer hostility the prospect of a second vote arouses in the people they represent.This is a subtler emotion than is usually depicted. It’s often described in simple terms of betrayal, as if leave voters will not forgive their Brexit being “stolen” from them, as Liam Fox puts it. But others describe a quieter sentiment, a resentment that MPs – who are paid to adjudicate on tough and complicated issues – are instead dumping into the laps of voters a conundrum that has stumped the country’s supposed leaders. With that in mind, a couple of Westminster’s more thoughtful figures have been trying to work out how a second referendum, if it comes to that, can avoid being a simple rerun of 2016, with all the animus and ision such a ballot is bound to stir. I’m not referring here to the determination many remainers have to fight a better, more effective campaign: less accountancy, more poetry less cerebral, more emotional less project fear, more project hope less establishment, more insurgent. Though all those concerns are well founded.No, what I have in mind is an effort to make the referendum exercise itself both legitimate in the eyes of leavers and substantively different to the first one. On the first count, it will help if the ballot is seen as a move by May, rather than a demand successfully pressed by the People’s Vote campaign. Much as I admire the latter, leave voters are likelier to accept a plebiscite called by a Tory prime minister seeking to make Brexit happen than one effected by remainers bent on halting it.But it will also help if the two competing propositions on the ballot – and let’s make the hopeful assumption that no parliament would present a no-deal crash-out as if it were a viable option, since that would be criminally irresponsible – are both significantly different from the leave v remain choices of 2016. It’s easy to see how leave would differ this time around. In place of the abstract, wishful idea of leave – which Brexiteers cast as a pain-free cash bonanza and panacea for all Britain’s ills – would be a concrete, detailed plan for leaving: May’s plan, more or less.What, though, of the other side of the ballot paper? Remain will be weakened if it looks like an appeal to wind the clock back to 22 June 2016, as if the status quo ante were some unimprovable nirvana. It would be accused of not having listened to a word leavers have said about why they wanted out.That’s why some are talking of a “reformed remain” option, an alternative to leave that does not smack of a complacent desire to pretend Brexit never happened. For those Labour MPs in leave seats, their chief hope is that they can signal to their voters that both they and the EU itself have heard their concerns on one issue especially: immigration.I admit to finding this effort depressing. I’d rather live in a country where free movement is seen as a cherished right, a two-word promise of liberation – offering Britons the ability to live, work, travel, study and fall in love anywhere across a vast, erse and rich continent. But millions of my fellow citizens don’t see free movement that way. The choice for remainers is to tell those voters they’re wrong, and lose another referendum – or allay their fears and win.In that context, how much more powerful would the remain case be next time if it could say that a Britain that chose to stay in the EU would have more say on migration? No one is expecting an opt-out on free movement: the EU would never grant such a thing. But when Yvette Cooper’s home affairs select committee probed what measures would still be compatible with the rules of the single market, it found many already used by other EU member states – a whole range of controls that, mysteriously, neither David Cameron nor May ever took up – as well as several possibilities, legal under EU treaty law, that have never been properly explored. (Since the referendum, the EU has, for example, revised its rules to prevent workers’ pay and conditions being undercut by employees posted from abroad.) Of course, there are multiple problems with this approach. For one thing, who exactly would negotiate this improved remain option with the EU? Brussels will only talk to governments it would not open up a parallel track to a panel of remain-minded dissidents. Such a process would also take time, though that’s true of any move to a referendum: if this is the path May takes, she will have to rescind or extend article 50.But what it surely comes down to is political will. On Friday Tony Blair suggested Brexit would be as damaging a blow to the European project as it would be to Britain. Accordingly, the EU27 should want to enhance the appeal of remain. Not necessarily, says Charles Grant, the well-plugged-in head of the Centre for European Reform. Sweden, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands and perhaps Germany may want to help, Grant says, perhaps adding “some tinsel and coloured lights” to various EU loopholes on migration, so that remain can boast of having reformed free movement. But the more “hardcore federalists” in the commission, and in France, “have mixed feelings about our departure. For decades, we’ve been the pebble in their shoe. We’ve been such a bloody pain” that some will be relieved when we’ve gone.Even so, if Britons stare into the abyss of Brexit and decide to step back, voting in a second referendum to stay in the EU, that would be a huge boost to the EU and, given Britain’s size as well as its security and intelligence muscle, a major geopolitical prize. It makes sense to urge the EU to do its bit to ensure that remain has the best shot at winning a fresh contest. I understand why Juncker and friends don’t want to help Theresa May leave. But they have an alternative. They can help us stay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5dabe43d2287f2c4ab0ba90f1744c0c5005070d/0_178_5344_3207/master/5344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1e68c87c4ac1d71487be1eac2ab7570","title":"democracy authoritarianism media spotlight viktor orban","story":"Shining a light on authoritarians’ actions is not enough – the media need to focus on trends behind the day-to-day newsDemocracy is in crisis and, for some, ignorance is to blame. Take the slogan of one major American newspaper: “Democracies die in darkness.” It represents a simplistic answer to the rise of authoritarian and populist forces around the globe. The reason for its popularity is, undoubtedly, its appeal to an Enlightenment logic, in which knowledge means power and progress. Hence, the argument goes, if people would only know how bad politicians like Donald Trump are, they will turn away from them, and democracy is saved.There is no doubt that transparency is vital for liberal democracy to flourish, but that does not mean that it creates liberal democracy, nor that its absence kills liberal democracy – as centuries of national, and decades of European, democratic rule show. The problem of this idea is that it is based on a broad range of false assumptions, most notably that just shining light will lead to enlightenment.In reality, few democracies have died in darkness. Even the paradigmatic case of Weimar Germany, in which Adolf Hitler came to power by democratic means to subsequently abolish democracy and throw the world into the most deadly abyss in history, did not happen in “darkness”. Everyone knew, or should have known, what Hitler stood for. His bestseller Mein Kampf (My Struggle), which he wrote in prison after a failed coup d’état, might have been badly written, but it repeated his antisemitic and antidemocratic ideas ad nauseum. And he dismantled the democratic system while independent media were still alive and kicking.More recently, authoritarian leaders have rarely abolished liberal democracy overnight. Rather, they slowly but steadily chip away at its liberal foundations first, and its electoral foundations later. From Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Vladimir Putin, and from Niclás Maduro to Viktor Orbán, liberal democracies are carefully and often cautiously dismantled, piece by piece, in the spotlight of, at least initially, a relatively free and independent media. These leaders openly express their authoritarian impulses, their disdain for (the) opposition, and their intent to fundamentally change the political system.In many cases, authoritarian leaders defend every inidual “chip” by pointing to similar policies in other western democracies. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, is a master at this, taking inidual institutions and rules from a broad variety of EU member states to build, what the US sociologist Kim-Lane Scheppele has aptly called, a “Frankenstate”. Just like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein monster, which is created from all human body parts, the Frankenstate is made up of democratic rules. Each inidual rule is, or can be, democratic, but the specific combination of them, creates an undemocratic regime.Shining light on each inidual component, in isolation, will therefore not expose the Frankenstate. As long as the inidual components are not connected, each measure is also, in and by itself, not enough to create a sense of alarm, let alone urgency, among the citizenry and internal organizations. Look at the hapless responses of the European Union to Orbán’s near-decade of attacks on democracy in Hungary, or the lukewarm responses to voter suppression in many US states (including my state, Georgia).Democracies can as easily die in the spotlight as in darkness. Media that simply “report the news”, rather than analyze it, miss trends, and only see the real threat when it is too late. That is why the media critic Jay Rosen has been arguing for a new media logic for several months now, as authoritarian leaders have mastered the old one, and play it to their strength. This is one of the reasons why he, like me, supports a new media initiative from the Netherlands, The Correspondent, which promises to bring “unbreaking news” and focus on trends behind the day-to-day news.We need the media to break out of its mutually beneficial addiction with mediagenic authoritarians like Trump, and shine its spotlight on the real threats to democracy, rather than the deflections offered by the authoritarians. But even if the media do that, democracies will still die when mainstream elites – cultural, economic, political and religious – continue to collaborate with authoritarians rather than openly oppose them. And they will continue to die, if democratic politicians do not offer better alternatives than the authoritarians.The best example of this sad state of affairs is Hungary, which this week took the final step towards a (competitive) authoritarian regime, by abolishing independent judicial control on the government. While it is true that this step was taken “in darkness”, at least within the country, as Orbán’s cronies control practically all Hungarian media, most previous steps were taken in full light, scrutinized by various still independent media.Moreover, international media have covered Orbán’s creation of an “illiberal state” in detail, but complicity of foreign elites, from the German car industry to the European People’s party (EPP), has left the EU unable, and unwilling, to act. Both hide behind the false excuse that collaboration leads to his moderation, while exclusion will further radicalize him. But they also rightly note that Orbán is the most popular politician in the country, and that the heavily ided, and partly complicit, opposition offers no viable alternative.Perhaps the media can shine more light on all these factors, and connect them in enlightening analyses. We need to look at trends that underlie the “news of the day”, and not be distracted by every Trump tweet or focus almost exclusively on the low-hanging fruits (like the latest raucous White House press conferences or palace intrigues). After all, while democracies cannot flourish in darkness, autocracies cannot flourish in the light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f98e9c9a73ebabf73bcb3654f041e38bd9b6144/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f28982134f5e9a9068f089e711f811f5","title":"thousands turn out for unveiling of emmeline pankhurst statue in manchester","story":"Sculpture of suffragette is only second statue of woman in city after Queen VictoriaThousands of people have turned out in the freezing cold to welcome home Emmeline Pankhurst – the first female statue in Manchester that is not of Queen Victoria.The Moss Side-born suffragette was the overwhelming winner in a public vote three years ago to choose which woman should be immortalised in bronze, beating the Victorian novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, the anti-racism campaigner Louise da-Cocodia and “Red” Ellen Wilkinson, the Labour cabinet minister and leader of the Jarrow March.Members of the public then chose the final design, by sculptor Hazel Reeves. Her last big commission was the “cracker packer” statue honouring the lives of female biscuit factory workers in the Cumbrian city of Carlisle.Reeves chose to portray Pankhurst in full tub-thumping mode, standing on a chair as she rallied a crowd. Helen Pankhurst, the suffragette’s great-granddaughter, was among those who unveiled the “Our Emmeline” statue on Friday, 100 years to the day after some women got the vote for the first time in the UK.With her was 12-year-old Fatima Shahid, a pupil at Manchester Enterprise Academy, who told the 6,000-strong crowd that she hoped this was “just the first” of many Mancunian women who would be honoured in sculpture form.About 1,000 thousand schoolchildren were among the many who marched to St Peter’s Square for the unveiling, chanting “deeds not words” as the bronze sculpture was revealed.Beforehand, they danced to Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves by Aretha Franklin and Annie Lennox and waved homemade banners. One had felt-tipped “I would rather be a rebel than a slave”, one of Pankhurst’s most famous sayings, and surrounded it with red hearts.link, which runs Manchester’s busy tram system, agreed to pause the trams through the square during the event, to ensure the warning horn did not ruin the moment. Earlier, 94-year-old Nancy Sawyer had volunteered to chain herself to the railings to stop the trams from disturbing the ceremony.Many in the crowd, including Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester’s mayor, wore sashes in suffragette green, white and purple, and rosettes saying “rise up women”.Wendy Eachus, 62, was dressed in her old school hat tied with purple ribbon, walking with the help of a lilac frame. She is one of the “Waspi” women campaigning against state pension inequality. “We are following in the footsteps of the suffragettes,” she said. “Without Emmeline Pankhurst we would not be able to campaign today.”Until Friday, 16 of the 17 statues in Manchester city centre were of men. The exception was that of Queen Victoria, erected 117 years ago, according to local councillor Andrew Simcock, who started the female statue campaign and was the only man to address the launch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd867c65af95a5b2133a87b6a7f53df5c88e33dd/433_363_2286_1372/master/2286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0e8b44557ffdb2e2b618c35e84a2d60","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Bird battles, snoozing seals and mischievous macaques in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a622094f87a1ccb0f7b182b8fd63fee4f1d7a9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac29dcd5d94e5e743e1d24875ae40eaf","title":"quick and easy roast chicken with a twist","story":"Cookery writer Eve Marleau adds a French-inspired twist to a traditional roast chicken with Boursin As a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, for me, Boursin had one role – to act as an exotic option on the Christmas cheeseboard. In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half.

Sunday 23 December, 3.25pm, BBC OneElf(Jon Favreau, 2003)Will Ferrell is full of festive cheer as Buddy the elf, who discovers he’s not really one of Santa’s little helpers – he’s 6ft tall and human – and sets off to find his real father, who turns out to be very Scroogey book publisher (James Caan) in New York. There are touches of computer-animated trickery, and likable support from the likes of Ed Asner and Zooey Deschanel, but it’s Ferrell who parcels out the fun. Sunday 23 December, 4.55pm, ITV2Wes Anderson’s lovely, loopy comedy is set in the eponymous hotel, in the fictional republic of Zubrowka, where legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and orphan bellboy Zero (Tony Revolori) become embroiled in a struggle for a priceless painting. The most colourful character is the hotel itself, a triumph of gorgeously eccentric art design. Sunday 23 December, 11.20pm, Film4The Shape of Water(Guillermo del Toro, 2017)As with any good fishing story, the Oscar-laden praise for Guillermo del Toro’s romantic fantasy was somewhat exaggerated. But it’s nevertheless a darkly compelling tale, in which mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) and her amphibian lover (Doug Jones) must evade national security forces and find true love in a beautifully ramshackle 1950s sci-fi-retro world.Sunday 23 December, 12.10am, Sky Cinema PremiereZootropolis(Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush, 2016)This Disney effort is a funny bunny tale about rookie cop Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), the first rabbit on the force of animal-city Zootopia. She is consigned to parking-ticket duty by police chief Bogo (Idris Elba) but soon gets her teeth into the case of 14 missing mammals, with the help of sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). Christmas Eve, 2.55pm, BBC OneScrooge: A Christmas Carol(Brian Desmond Hurst, 1951)A warm-as-mince-pies version of the Dickens tale, with Alastair Sim a Scrooge incarnate, his miserly humbuggery a gloomy delight. C Pennington-Richards’s snowy, atmospheric photography is superb but beware the ghostly visitation of Michael Hordern’s chain-clanking, shrieking Jacob Marley: he’s a real gothic horror. Christmas Eve, 4.20pm, Channel 5Mary Poppins(Robert Stevenson, 1964)With the Emily Blunt update breezing into cinemas, here is the wonderful original. Julie Andrews won an Oscar for her magical nanny, who flies in to No 17 Cherry Tree Lane to put the Banks family right. David Tomlinson’s fuddy-duddy daddy, finally learning the fun of kite-flying, steals the show, while Dick Van Dyke’s gor-blimey-guv chimney sweep is unintentionally hilarious. A joyful blend of song, dance and animation: Emily will have to pull something special out of the bag to match Julie. Christmas Eve, 5pm, BBC OneVaughn’s spy spoof stars an effortlessly dapper Colin Firth as Harry Hart – the 007, as it were, of the Kingsmen. He is inducting young geezer Eggsy (Taron Egerton) in the mysterious ways of his secret-busting organisation, and of his gadget-packed brolly, while foiling the world-conquering plans of arch-nemesis Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) with a near-terminal dose of laddish humour. Christmas Eve, 9pm, Film4Avengers: Infinity War (Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, 2018)A bewildering number of superheroes join this third Avengers assemblage. And from Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man to Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, they need every last one of them, being up against Josh Brolin’s universe-threatening Thanos. The Russo brothers do a superhuman job in giving each character his or her moment in an apocalyptic Marvel movie. Christmas Day, 10.30am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereWallace \u0026amp Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit(Nick Park, Steve Box, 2005)This first full-length feature adventure for wacky inventor Wallace and his much smarter dog Gromit has the duo running an anti-rabbit business that gets very busy when a supersized bunny threatens the produce at Lady Tottington’s annual giant vegetable fete. It’s a hilarious spoof of antique Hammer horror films, brought joyously to life with modelling clay. Christmas Day, 11am, BBC OneThe Jungle Book(Jon Favreau, 2016)Jon Favreau’s reworking of both the Kipling story and Disney’s 1967 animated version is a wondrous thing. Little Neel Sethi is Mowgli, immersed in a world of beasts so realistically formed by CGI they look as though they’ve just stepped out of Dynasties. They are voiced by a stellar cast including Bill Murray (Baloo), Scarlett Johansson (Kaa) and Idris Elba as Shere Khan. Tremendous fun and thrills. Christmas Day, 3.10pm, BBC OneMonsters, Inc(Peter Docter, 2001)So there are monsters hiding in cupboards to scare children at night – but they’re only employees of Monsters, Inc, collecting the screams that fuel their city, Monstropolis. Their world and ours collide in this exuberant and witty animated adventure from Pixar, featuring the big blue furry monster Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and Mike, his little one-eyed critter sidekick (Billy Crystal). Christmas Day, 4.10pm, ITVThe Greatest Showman(Michael Gracey, 2017)An effortlessly charismatic Hugh Jackman bosses the stage as the 19th-century circus ringmaster PT Barnum in this irresistible musical. It follows a familiar rags-to-riches trajectory, with young Phineas and wife Charity (Michelle Williams) going into partnership with a fellow entrepreneur (Zac Efron) in creating a barnstorming show that, to the irrepressible tunes of La La Land’s songsters Pasek and Paul, finds fame and strikes a triumphant blow for ersity. Christmas Day, 6.45pm, Sky 1Murder in a country pile in England, circa 1932: the setting is pure Agatha Christie, but for Altman the whodunnit is less important than the gallery of characters above and below stairs. The screen glows with excellence, from the impeccable performances (Helen Mirren, Kristin Scott Thomas and all) to Andrew Dunn’s lustrous cinematography and Julian Fellowes’s acerbically literate script. Christmas Day, 9.15pm, Paramount NetworkTrain to Busan(Yeon Sang-ho, 2016)Here is a film to challenge Runaway Train as the most gut-churning railway-themed thriller of all. South Korean director Yeon has a horde of zombies invading the high-speed KTX train from Seoul to Busan while a orced dad (Gong Yoo) tries to save his daughter (Kim Su-an) from the ferocious people-eaters, in a gleefully bloodthirsty satire. The animated prequel, Seoul Station, follows on Boxing Day. Christmas Day, 1.15am, Film4The Young Victoria(Jean-Marc Vallée, 2009)There is a touch of The Princess Diaries-in-period-dress about this story of Queen Victoria’s teenage years. It’s short on substance, but the settings and costumery are splendid. Emily Blunt makes a charming young monarch, with Rupert Friend her Albert and Paul Bettany as prime minister Lord Melbourne. Boxing Day, 10.20am, BBC TwoThe Witches(Nicolas Roeg, 1989)The late Nicolas Roeg’s child-oriented fantasy, adapted from the classic Roald Dahl story, casts a strong enough spell to snare adults, too. Jasen Fisher plays Luke, the lad ensconced with granny Mai Zetterling who discovers a coven of witches meeting secretly at an English seaside hotel. After being turned into a mouse, Luke starts to nibble away at head witch Anjelica Huston’s powers. Boxing Day, 11.05am, ITVRaiders of the Lost Ark(Steven Spielberg, 1981)“Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?” Nice Spielbergian touch to give his heroic adventurer Indiana Jones these little human fears and foibles. First, fastest and funniest of the Jones movies, with Harrison Ford’s indestructible archaeologist chasing pell-mell from Nepal to Cairo with plucky partner Karen Allen to whip the ark of the covenant from under Nazi noses. Tremendous. Boxing Day, 1.25pm, BBC OneThe origins of the film legend that is Mary Poppins, served with a big spoonful of sugar. Emma Thompson is the wonderfully crotchety PL Travers, protective author of the book that Tom Hanks’s Walt Disney is desperate to bring to cinematic life. It’s a supercali (etc) double act: she is witheringly dismissive of his art, while Walt masks his will to win with twinkly charm. Delightful. Boxing Day, 2.30pm, BBC TwoThe BFG(Steven Spielberg, 2016)Based on a screenplay by ET writer Melissa Mathison, Spielberg’s family favourite shares that film’s childlike sense of wonder. Ruby Barnhill is orphan Sophie, who sets off to the fantasticalhorrible Giant Country with new friend the BFG – a rather small, sad giant, it turns out. Mark Rylance’s performance shines through the superb motion-capture magic. Boxing Day, 5.40pm, BBC OneFive Easy Pieces(Bob Rafelson, 1971)An early Jack Nicholson hit that marked him for superstardom. His feckless wandering minstrel, Bobby Eroica Dupea, is born of a musicians’ family but prefers working the oil rigs to playing the piano. Karen Black and Susan Anspach are the women he scorns, but the core of it is in the scene with his sick, silent father on a windy hilltop: an achingly poignant American tale. Friday 28 December, 10.35am, Sky Cinema ClassicsIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade(Steven Spielberg, 1989)The last of the original trilogy, with Harrison Ford’s weary hero again racing the Nazis to buried treasure, in this case the Holy Grail. The action is still a sharp blend of comic-book and back-street violence, pepped up no end by Sean Connery as Jones’s medievalist dad. Friday 28 December, 1.15pm, BBC OneIn this Steven Spielberg story, the Goonies – a coastal Oregon branch of the Secret Seven – discover a pirate treasure map and, in desperate need of money to save their home from land developers, set off on the traditional hunt. But the map’s author, long-dead buccaneer One-Eyed Willy, has also left a series of ancient booby-traps to overcome. It’s a slow starter, but builds up to some fine mini-Indiana Jones thrills. Friday 28 December, 11.40pm, TCMThe Star Wars prequel trilogy having disappeared into an exceedingly dull black hole, Abrams reboots the franchise with energy and spectacle. He also recruits gutsy new characters, with Daisy Ridley’s lone scavenger Rey and John Boyega’s renegade stormtrooper Finn joining the fight against the dark side, embodied by chilling new villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). All this, plus the lump-in-the-throat returns of Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia and Harrison Ford’s Han Solo.Sunday 30 December, 8pm, ITVAfter the emotional pyrotechnics of Skyfall, there is a sense of business as usual in the latest Bond adventure, but it’s still a killer of a thriller. Following on from the previous film’s carnage, it sees Daniel Craig’s buffed agent chasing, fighting and loving his way around the world, starting with a stunning opening scene in Mexico City. For 007, the mission is more personal than usual. His target? The shadowy mastermind of terror organisation Spectre. New Year’s Eve, 8pm, ITVAbsolutely Fabulous: The Movie(Mandie Fletcher, 201)Jennifer Saunders’s Edina and Joanna Lumley’s Patsy are back for this big, daft but fun TV spin-off. A sitcom episode-thin plot has them “killing” Kate Moss and going on the run, by budget airline, to Cannes. Everywhere you look there’s a famous face – John Hamm, Graham Norton, fashion icons Stella McCartney and Alexa Chung – heaving into view. New Year’s Eve, 9pm, BBC OneInside Out(Peter Docter, Ronnie Del Carmen, 2015)One of the brightest jewels in the Pixar crown, this dazzlingly inventive animated comedy takes place inside the head of 11-year-old Riley (voiced by Kaitlin Dyas), where five bickering embodiments of feelings control her actions: Fear, Anger, Disgust, Sadness and – thankfully, to balance all the negativity – the ebullient Joy (Amy Poehler). It’s a great excuse for a thrilling, emotional journey through a surreal internal landscape. New Year’s Day, 5pm, BBC OneThe Revenant(Alejandro González Iñárritu, 2015)Iñárritu’s jaw-droppingly ferocious, majestically shot tale of wilderness survival is based on the true adventures of 1820s frontiersman Hugh Glass. As played by Leonardo DiCaprio, he is horrendously mangled by an angry bear, left for dead by weaselly fellow trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and then crawls, hobbles and hacks his way through all manner of savagery towards safety, and vengeance.

Not only does it use mostly storecupboard ingredients, but you can use it as a template, throw virtually any fruit into it and whip it up without much fuss (or baking smarts). Here, I’ve used pears, almonds and chocolate because, together, they perform as tightly as the three wise men. The biggest joy of all, however, is that despite its simplicity, it is still very pretty, very naughty and very nice.Add some spices into the almond mixture, if you like.

In the week leading up to Sunday’s Premier League trip to Anfield, MUTV has continued to seek new subscribers by pushing a rather telling product.“Mourinho Press Conferences Uncut!” the banner advert on the website promises, as it has for some time, offering unfettered, peeled-eyeball access to one part of United’s season that appears to be still flying off the shelves.It is not hard to picture the marketing meeting on this one. What have we got then? Goals? Sparkling football? Er, no. But we do have José telling people off, the weekly pressroom postmortems where those wounded, baleful eyes take on the look of a man being forced very slowly to eat forkfuls of his own liver all the while trying heroically to pretend that in fact he is doing this of his own free will and as a noble deed to save someone else.What next, you wonder? Authentic MUFC stadium-groan ringtones? Club-branded Albert Camus outfit supplied by United’s official existential ennui partner? Roll up, roll up. Watch in HD as we monetise our own pain.Not that Mourinho or United are ready to roll over just yet. Defeat at Valencia in midweek should not cloud the fact United have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League from a tough-looking group.Free-flowing victory at home to Fulham last Saturday was significant even against a team who also conceded four to Cardiff. At the end of which one of the most febrile away days in English football’s unremittingly febrile history arrives at a fascinating moment in the seasons of both United and Liverpool.For Jürgen Klopp the weekend’s big-ticket game offers a rare and precious thing for any Liverpool manager. Victory could effectively kill Manchester United’s league season and perhaps even add a decisive blow in Mourinho’s own extended retreat from Old Trafford. Should United lose and the teams above them win, they would be 11 points off fourth spot, the likely base level for Mourinho to stay in the job into next summer. On the other hand, victory for United – or even the avoidance of defeat – could be a significant marker too given the history of this fixture, which has tended to stand as a staging point in the snakes and ladders of rising eras, ruined empires and periods of retrenchment.This is a meeting of two teams without a league title between them in the past five years. But it still feels a more emotionally significant rivalry than Liverpool and Manchester City, whatever the relative strengths of those two teams. With good reason too. Between them United and Liverpool have won a third of all English league titles. They have defined themselves against one another, sketched out their periods of success and relative decline.It is this sense of conjoined fates that adds an extra glaze of interest to Sunday’s meeting. For the first time in a quarter century Liverpool are unarguably and demonstrably in the ascendant on almost every score. If not quite on the perch, they are hungrily staking it out, top of the league and last season’s Champions League finalists, while United are as close points-wise to the relegation spots as they are to the top.More significantly Klopp has an opportunity to apply, if not the decisive death blow to a United era, then a significant cut. Mourinho is still favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, albeit defeat at Anfield would hasten rather than spark his departure. It would also be an experience with a few recent echoes. Here is an odd coincidence: Mourinho left Real Madrid a month after the 4-1 defeat by Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund in April 2013 two years later Mourinho was sacked at Chelsea a month after the traumatic 3-1 defeat by Klopp’s Liverpool at Stamford Bridge during which the travelling fans sang “you’re getting sacked in the morning” and the wheel turned decisively against him.Klopp has a chance of an extended José hat-trick here. Not that anything of the sort will be on his mind. The preoccupation is instead with trajectory, the rising of another red-shaded era, this one in the west. This has long been the maths between these two clubs, imagined or not. Jamie Carragher has suggested Alex Ferguson did not actually knock Liverpool off their perch in the early 90s, that it was Norwich and Aston Villa that United were competing with in that first Premier League-branded season. But Liverpool had been the dominant power for over a decade when United went to Anfield for the most ominous – and indeed for Liverpool fans encouraging – precursor to Sunday’s game.Back in March 1993 United came to Anfield in a similar position to Klopp’s Liverpool now. This was an energetically regeared team under a new-ish manager still feeling for the next stage, squinting into the glare of a first league title in a quarter of a century. Liverpool were 15th in the league table. United could finally go top by winning this game against a mix and match team of old and new, with Ian Rush among Liverpool’s scorers, a replacement for the misjudged big money transfer Paul Stewart.True to current comparisons Liverpool were even managed by a scowling misanthropist in the shape of Graeme Souness. Goals from Mark Hughes and Brian McClair gave United victory and a run to the title from there. “No hiding place from harsh realities in Liverpool,” noted the Times. “Mature United confirm championship credentials,” confirmed the , both paper’s reports preserved in the excellent archive of the lfchistory.net website.“Manchester United are on top of the Premier League, that first elusive title for 25 years seemingly within their grasp, after a magnificent piece of football theatre on one of the game’s great stages,” was the Sunday Times’s take, although a similarly dramatic denouement seems less likely on Sunday, if only because both teams have tended to grind and sit deep in their better moments this season.Winning these big one-off games is still a strength for Mourinho. For Klopp’s Liverpool, losing finalist in three cup competitions, this is a first real jumping off point in the more attritional challenge of dragging his team across the line in the league.It is a vital moment in that regard. Liverpool will also play Arsenal and Manchester City before the festive baubles come down. In their favour the victory against Napoli was both impressively resilient and laced with the kind of tactical patterns that may yet be employed against City in January, with a succession of rapid breaks and long passes into the space behind the full-backs.In the other dugout Mourinho, the king of pain, will welcome a chance to show his base quality and the paradox of his elite club career, the ability to dredge out fine results as an underdog. Albeit one laced here with a sense of seesawing destiny, of club trajectories that tend to pass along the way on days like these."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a5675ff82c876ff2c827f80a2ab822079ce51d/0_8_3836_2301/master/3836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9883c0a5f5885b8f4ae6558909ae2b52","title":"manchester city v everton premier league live","story":"5 min: Jesus is sent scampering free down the right by Bernardo, but he’s gone too early.

City wear Santa’s sky blue, while Everton are in their royal blue. It’s a cold, drizzly day. We’ll be off in a minute!Fickle Santa was once a red. But he’s a Citizen now. Hey, if the likes of Coca-Cola and White Rock ginger ale can appropriate him for the purposes of soft-beverage brand recognition, then the English football champions should be allowed to defile him as well. To be fair, the big man looks good in sky blue.Silva speaks! “We have a plan, our shape in some moments could be different. When we have the ball we have to show ambition to play our game. We know where City are a strong team and we must try to be solid. If you want to do something here, you have to try to score. Dominic Calvert-Lewin gives us speed, he is very strong, he can create on the sides and in the box, and is very strong with his head. We deserved more in our games against the strong sides, but it’s part of the game, it’s important we learn.”Pep talks! “Kevin De Bruyne has made two or three training sessions with the team. It’s better for him to take it step by step, a process. Raheem Sterling has played a lot of games, and everybody deserves to play, wants to play. Raheem is so important but everybody has to play. I try to move the squad and keep everyone involved, if we achieve something this season it will be because of everybody. Everton will be tough, they may play five at the back. I have no doubts that we will respond to last week’s defeat.”Manchester City make four changes to the team that saw off Hoffenheim on Wednesday night in the Champions League. Riyad Mahrez, Fernandinho, Fabian Delph and Kyle Walker replace Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden, Alexander Zinchenko and John Stones, who all drop to the bench. Sitting in the dugout alongside them: Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne, back from injury and box fresh.Everton make two changes from the draw with Watford last weekend. Kurt Zouma and Dominic Calvert-Lewin replace Idrissa Gueye and Theo Walcott.Manchester takes on Merseyside this weekend. Tomorrow’s clash between United and Liverpool may be the self-styled Big One, but never mind that right now, because this encounter between City and Everton promises to be just as fascinating.The champions are coming off the back of a rare Premier League defeat, having been swept aside by David Luiz last weekend. That 2-0 reverse at Chelsea allowed Liverpool to knock them off the top of the table City are unlikely to take this turn of events lying down. They’ve won all eight of their Premier League home matches so far this season, scoring 30 times and letting in just five. Everton have quite the task against a magical team doubly determined on the rebound.And yet Everton will quietly fancy their chances. Admittedly their away form hasn’t been all that: just one win in seven. But it’s a fine line between success and failure sometimes, and it’s not crazy to argue that the Toffees could, on another day, have won at Chelsea. And at Liverpool. Marco Silva’s got them playing again. It’s also worth remembering that Everton haven’t been beaten at City in the League since December 2014, a run of three draws. City may be favourites this lunchtime, but they’ve got something to think about too.This one’s nicely in the balance, then. Will City rediscover the winning habit and go back to the top of the table? Or will Everton do their city rivals a solid by becoming the first team this campaign to take points off Pep Guardiola’s side at the Etihad? It’s going to be a blast finding out. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

In my teens I grew to resent it. As an atheist adult, could I find an alternative?On Christmas morning 2009, after my customary breakfast in bed of a chocolate orange accompanied by a large portion of foreboding, I pad downstairs to locate my parents. Ah, there’s my father. He’s dressed for church, not in his Sunday best, nor even in his problematic lay preacher’s cassock (white, pointed hood) – but in what appears to be a star-adorned navy curtain shrunk to fit the dimensions of a child’s playhouse.“And if we go over your lines one more time…” prompts my mother, with the maniacally bright smile of someone who has been entrusted with raising morale during the apocalypse.It’s a familiar scene – my parents are members of the Church in Wales, and the nativity has long formed the spine of my Christmases – so I wait for them to finish.My father replies: “I thought it was just the one line, lovey? ‘I bring a gift of myrrh…’”“No, I told you, Jacob and Lily have chickenpox and can’t come. So you’re bringing the gold and frankincense as well.”He catches sight of me lurking in the corner. “That’s a lot for one wise man to carry, isn’t it, Gwen?” he hoots, exaggeratedly miming dropping an armful of trinkets. It is difficult to know what is more perplexing. The fact that he, a fiftysomething, has agreed to act in the nativity play again. Or the fatherly tendency to imagine his daughter’s sense of humour has been frozen since the age of three.“Right, we’ve got to get to the Sunday school room to set up,” mutters my mother, shepherding him towards the front door. “The key’s on the sideboard,” comes a distant yell, followed by a loud slam. I’m left in an unfestive silence.That’s how it goes in the Smith household. Christmas morning is not about exchanging presents or making the stuffing or gleefully opening the extra-large window in the advent calendar you forgot the previous day. It’s about the nativity. My mother runs it. My father gamely takes part (with declining congregations, Sunday schools are no longer the hives of eager young thespians they once were). Atheist me, the odd one out, glowers from the sidelines. Well, that’s after smarting at being abandoned and considering not going at all – before rushing to church at the last minute and sulking in the back row. That’s what happened in 2009, the first year I was no longer involved in the play (I had left to be a student), and the point at which I began questioning whether it needed to form part of my Christmas at all.In my late teens and early 20s, the play was nothing more than a frenzied obstacle between me and the ordered, elegant, largely secular Christmases enjoyed by my friends. Or, as I saw it at the time, Literally Everyone In The World Apart From Me. As a child I loved taking part. I gamely greeted the Lord’s birth wearing a succession of damp-smelling tunics (shepherd), yellowing bedsheets (angel) and hairbands with cotton wool glued on to them (sheep). It was a chance to dress up and eat medically unwise quantities of selection-box Curly Wurlys.But it became less appealing in adolescence. There weren’t enough of us in the parish, so my peers and I were still forced to perform. Parishioners were recently treated to the discomfiting spectacle of a bearded, 40-year-old Joseph escorting a primary school-age Mary to Bethlehem.And so we return to the ghost of Christmas 2009. You would think navigating the nativity as an adult might have been easy, not least because I was – finally – no longer expected on stage. It wasn’t. Without filling my time the way I did as a teenager, with squabbles about being too old to don a tinsel crown (a position I maintain), the morning now felt directionless. It was also, given my parents’ early departure for church, lonely. Suddenly, not participating felt as isolating as announcing a newfound ambivalence towards pigs-in-blankets. I didn’t want to be involved in the show any longer. But I wanted to be involved in… something.Why? I guess my church childhood hardwired me to crave ceremony. You try growing up having your year nicely shaped into a string of cosy festivals, each with its own reassuring ritual, and not coming out at the other end with a sheepish yearning for tradition. Not liking the ceremony I’d been lumped with didn’t stop me looking for it elsewhere.Church was also my first taste of community and belonging. Yes, I’ve now rejected Christianity and found those things in other places – in my friendship group, my career, and the corner of the internet that celebrates Julia Roberts’s 1980s hair (what a lustrous mane!). But at Christmas, offices close and friends – while thankfully only a WhatsApp away – tend to hunker down with their own families. If my template for the season wasn’t religious, then I didn’t have one at all.Last December, I was offered that festive holy grail: an invitation to attend someone else’s (far less churchy) Christmas. Was this the “something” I was looking for? A chance to spend the day with reassuringly spiritually deficient folk, who weren’t likely to swap celebrations for stagecraft? There was the added bonus that it was in Sweden – a country in which, I had been led to believe, below-par Christmases are illegal. But despite the seasonally appropriate weather and chic decorations, I missed Christmas in Cardiff. And there was one thing I pined for more than anything else. You guessed it: the nativity.Why? Well, several gulps of rejuvenating Swedish air led to an epiphany: I missed the play because it sums up my family Christmas. More, it sums up the strange pull of the frazzled family Christmas, full stop.After all, as with every dysfunctional festive gathering, no one particularly enjoys the nativity. I can’t be the only one who fantasises about skipping it and going instead for a glamorous lunch somewhere devoid of familiar faces and their grating quirks. It’s messy, more work than it’s worth and usually ends in tears. And yet… a lot of people still do it. This is most certainly the fault of a cliche – the one that says company is more important than comfort at Christmas, and then pathologises anyone who dares to point out that there might be a more peaceful way to spend the holiday than bickering with relatives over the gravy. Even so, it points to a worthwhile truth. That’s right: at the tender age of 26, I had matured enough to realise that reality can sometimes trump fantasy. Even if that reality is unpredictable or messy, or if you stopped believing in God around the time you began to question the existence of Santa.In that spirit, when I’m in Cardiff this year, I won’t roll my eyes when Mum starts fretting about the attendance record of Ox Number Three. Instead, I’ll say soothing things, arrive at the service on time and generally make myself useful. Behind the scenes, that is. I draw the line at dusting off my shepherd’s tunic.• If you would like to comment on this piece for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6176dc56d75a95973cdc58bf1f6f0c34ab84db/0_41_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=400db1d1220c0ae9651fa2705b1ddc62","title":"how to ease a cold with herbs","story":"Our gardening export on how common culinary herbs can make brilliant medicinesThere’s nothing like a long-distance flight to test your immune system – my neighbour spluttered while the row behind hacked and the other side sniffled. Once home, and with the day the right way up, I lost no time in gathering some herbs to keep those germs at bay. The common cold is a beast, I believe, that cannot be tamed – you just have to ride it out – but a choice handful of our common culinary herbs are brilliant medicine. And they are far kinder to you, the environment and your purse than many over-the-counter cold medicines.Rosemary and sage are classic herbs for colds and sore throats. Both are known for their antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Rosemary is said to stimulate the circulatory system and thus is thought to encourage blood flow to the brain to relieve headaches. I find a steam inhalation of a handful of bruised stems and leaves works wonderfully for blocked sinuses.Sage is good for the first tickle of a sore throat, and is known to tone irritated tissues and kill bacteria. It’s a strong-tasting tea made more palatable with the addition of dried apple and a little honey, but it certainly soothes. You can combine it with thyme, which is a good expectorant.Lemon balm, Melissa officinalis, may be in thin supply at this time, but it is usually possible to find some low-growing leaves. It is a gentle and kind herb for a cold, helping to sweat out a fever, and has mild antiviral properties. It also has a very mild flavour, helping to improve the taste of other herbs. Again, aim to add a tablespoon of chopped herb to a cup of boiling water.I’m also partial to adding the weeds ribwort or broad leaf plantain to these teas. Both are known for their astringent and demulcent properties, meaning that they reduce inflammation, particularly of membranes. They are brilliant against insect bites and cuts, but equally, chopped up in a tea, they will soothe irritated mucous membranes, such as sore sinuses. You can use the leaves fresh or dried.The trick to all of these is to brew a good cup of tea. You want roughly one teaspoon of dried or one tablespoon of fresh herb chopped in a cup of boiling water (200ml). Add honey or lemon peel, if you desire. If you are pregnant, avoid sage, rosemary and thyme, but plantain and lemon balm are safe for general use. If you do not cover the boiled water for 10 minutes, you will lose precious volatile oils. Grandma knew best: use a teapot. If you hate herbal tea, turn the tablespoons into handfuls and add to a bath instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e368a8d2ec2087afe551631dd9185df84fc103/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b704906e8abd0faf798545abb75c2d2","title":"tim dowling its not even christmas yet and ive had turkey three times","story":"Fake Christmas at my father-in-law’s is good practice for whatever horrors the real thing has in storeIt’s the time of year when people suffer from Festive Stress, but I am already experiencing symptoms of its aftermath, Post-Festivity Stress Disorder.For us, the holiday season begins with Fake Thanksgiving – lunch with my wife’s American relatives on the weekend before Thanksgiving, which falls on an ordinary British Thursday and is therefore unsuitable for celebrating. This year, I followed it up with Real Thanksgiving, flying to the US three days later. Next comes Fake Christmas, hosted annually by my father-in-law some weeks before the 25th, when he is always in Cornwall. Let’s put it this way: I’m on my third turkey, and the Christmas tree decorations are still in the attic.On Fake Christmas morning, all my children are home and asleep in their beds. I peer around the door of the middle one’s room. “Did you want me to wake you?” I ask.“Ugh,” he says.“Because you said you might remake that cake you burned last night, but that you needed to get more ingredients?”“Fmmph,” he says.“Would it be helpful to let you know you have barely enough time to get to the shops and put it in the oven before we leave?”“Yes,” he says with smouldering fury.“Good,” I say. “I’m glad I could do this for you.”I wait an hour, until the cake is in the oven, before waking the youngest one, because I know he came home at the crack of dawn.“Wake up,” I say quietly. “It’s Fake Christmas.”He rolls over. “How will this affect agricultural forecasts?” he says.“Sorry?” I say.“You know,” he mumbles. “Increased production in the sector.”“Why are we talking about farming?” I say.He turns and open his eyes. I watch his pupils slowly screw into focus. “Aggh!” he screams. “What the hell are you doing?”“Waking you up!” I say. “It’s Fake Christmas!”“Fake Christmas is next week!” he says.“Incorrect!” I say. “The taxi is coming in 20 minutes.”Downstairs, the oldest one is pulling on a pair of my socks with an unlit fag between his lips. The middle one is peering into the oven and my wife is wrapping one final present. “Is he ready?” she asks.“He is far from ready,” I say.“This cake is far from ready,” the middle one says.“What’s he doing up there?” my wife says.“I dunno,” I say. “Hallucinating about presenting Countryfile.”“Should we leave him behind?” she says.“How can we?” I say. “It’s Fake Christmas.”And so, off in an Uber to grandfather’s house we go, with a sack full of presents, the middle one holding a molten cake with oven gloves and the youngest glaring at me through one red, resentful eye.“Do you want to discuss wheat yields?” I ask.“Shut up,” he says.A few hours later, I find myself wearing two paper hats and getting a little frustrated with my sons’ collective inability to grasp the mechanics of a simple Christmas cracker joke.“Cheese and onion?” the oldest one says.“Why would a pilot’s favourite crisp flavour be cheese and onion?” I say.“I don’t know,” he says.“Ready salted?” the middle one says.“How is that related to aviation?” I say.“Aviation flavoured?” says the youngest.“It’s plain,” I say.“So, technically, I was right,” the middle one says.That night, I retire early, exhausted, but with a sense of accomplishment: from my point of view, the holidays are nearly over.When the smoke alarm goes off in the dead of night, I surprise myself with my alacrity. By the time my wife is sitting up in bed, I am already on my feet, pushing through the dark in search of the door. Before I know it, I am flying down the stairs, looking from room to room for the source of the fire until I reach the kitchen, where the middle one is making toast.“Someone turned the dial all the way up,” he says, waving a smoking slice in the air.“It’s one in the morning,” I say.“It’s not my fault!” he says.I realise that, holiday-wise, I still have a long way to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88e39a3c179b22e9e7d0f4df23464267cb97c710/0_0_1258_755/master/1258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=161bba486fc7a344c180234338606d38","title":"i felt like an impostor a mixed race american in africa","story":"‘Passing for white’ was a complicated feeling at home in Ohio. In Chad, it was a whole different experience again. By  Alexander HurstEvery time I crossed the courtyard, walked past the well in the corner and slipped out of the baby blue gate nestled into the high brick wall that surrounded my Chadian host family’s house, I instantly became nasara. It’s a Ngambay word that means both “foreigner” and “white person” at the same time. A little pack of children would follow me down the red-dirt street, chanting “nah-sa-rah, nah-sa-rah” and laughing.During my first weeks in Moundou I had protested once – in jest – to Sem, a balding evangelical pastor with a belly and a deep laugh, who was my NGO’s main contact in the town. “You know my mom is black, right?” I said to him, from the passenger seat of his SUV.He chuckled, and simultaneously looked away from the dirt road as he accelerated his Toyota that sported a Christian fish sign and an American flag sticker on its bumper.“Yes, well,” he paused and pointed to my bare forearm, then looked me in the eyes, my blue eyes. “Just look at you, and then look at us!” He laughed again, then he turned his head back to the road and blared the car’s horn angrily at a motorcycle that was approaching the intersection from our left. He hit the accelerator again, forcing the motorcycle, or clando, as they are called locally, to swerve aside as we blew past in a cloud of dust.My friend Frederic worked at the largest employer in Moundou, a textiles company named CotonTchad, where he shovelled coal into furnaces for six hours a day. The company ran a “club”, which consisted of a few cabanas clustered around a tennis court that hadn’t been played on in 30 years, and a pool that lived a permanent dry season. It had pizza and free internet. Chadians with cars, and nasaras, went there.A few weeks after I had arrived in Moundou, Frederic took me to Club CotonTchad. The city hadn’t passed into dry season yet, and so the red-earth roads were jagged with ruts made by rainstorms, and our bicycles jostled and bumped until we got to the Rond Point de la Femme roundabout, then turned on to a paved main street that lead to across the Logone River, and eventually to N’Djamena.As we neared the river, the look and feel of the city dripped away to a dozen cracking, once cream-coloured concrete houses set back on lawns bordered by bushes in place of spike-topped front walls. This was the old area that, in colonial times, had been reserved for the French. There would have been a barricade at the beginning of the road, and Chadians would have been denied entry. Now, the houses belonged to CotonTchad, and where they finally ended, the club sat perched against the banks of the river.The green uniformed guard at Club CotonTchad’s gate did his own double take at me when I dismounted my bicycle and unclasped my helmet. He looked at me curiously, this nasara on a bicycle instead of in a car, but stepped aside and waved me in. I passed with a Parisian-lilted bonjour and he said bonjour back with the Chadian “r” that rolls off the tongue. A few steps in, I realised that Frederic was no longer beside me, and turned around to see that he had been stopped by the same guard who had let me pass unchallenged just moments before. I went back.“It’s OK,” I told him, “Frederic’s just showing me around. We’re going to go in and probably grab a Coca-Cola.”And so, Frederic and I walked into the heart of Club CotonTchad, where its post-imperial rust was framed by manicured grass – the kind with thick, sandpapery blades that can be coaxed out of a desiccated ground with only mildly exorbitant water use. We sat in plastic chairs at a round plastic table, flecked with our own sweat. It was pushing past 30C. I ordered the two most expensive Cokes in Moundou. Frederic poured his into a glass, I drank mine from the bottle. The Coke left a saccharine film in my mouth.Then we biked home in the rain, and even in the downpour I felt hot and dirty. On the way back an unknown stranger stopped us on the side of the road in the rain. He yelled something in Ngambay, and Frederic tried to calm him down. He looked at me then, in his stained and torn green shirt, gestured toward my helmet, and spoke to me in French.“A white man in Africa, he’s permitted everything,” he said with anger. “But what if I were to go to Europe, to France – what would happen then?”Biking away, in a country where I was unquestionably privileged and seen as white, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was passing, and that maybe, just maybe, this man was the only other one who knew. In Chad, I couldn’t have it both ways, couldn’t slip into the well-defined role of being white when it suited me, and then set myself apart from it when it did not. In Chad I was white.Passing for white is a well-anchored, though marginal, phenomenon in American racial history. There was never a uniform definition of who “counted” as black in the US, alternating between one-quarter ancestry (Virginia’s designation of “mulatto” in 1822), and the “one-drop rule” that spread throughout southern states during the Jim Crow era.Even as late as 1982, Susie Guillory Phipps, who identified as white, but whose great-great-great-great-grandmother was black, brought a lawsuit against the state of Louisiana to overturn the law forcing her birth certificate to declare her to be black. The law – a 1970 update from a previous one whose standard was “a trace of Negro ancestry” – had established 132 as the new colour line, and state genealogists had determined that Susie Phipps was 332 black. She lost her case.“It’s funny about passing,” the 1920s author Nella Larsen writes in one of the earliest novels to engage the phenomenon, “we disapprove of it and at the same time condone it. It excites our contempt and yet we rather admire it. We shy away from it with an odd kind of revulsion, but we protect it.” At the time she was writing, between 2,500 and 30,000 African Americans with light enough skin and physical features that allowed them to “pass” unquestioned into white society often did.Adrian Piper, ambiguously pigmented and a conceptual artist, writes in an essay, Passing for White, Passing for Black, that “in the African American community, we do not ‘out’ people who are passing as white in the European American community,” perhaps in recognition of a decision born in some sort of pain.Internalised racism, some may taunt. Pity, others may respond. The desire for “whiteness” shows up throughout our history as a persistent response to racism, or our notions of beauty, or a desire to belong, to be privy to the intimate moments of the Leitkultur through the unacknowledged silence that acknowledges you as just that. And those moments can happen, they can buzz in and out of your life, leaving you flecked with power and its seductiveness one moment, and then a sense of disembodiment in the next.One day you can grab your coffee from the counter of a Parisian cafe, cringing as the barista asks where you’re from, and then replies – curiously, innocently, unaware of what her words mean in the context of a country that has in its history counted people as fractions – that you don’t look cent pour cent américain, and the next day your friend’s uncle can tell you that he’s actually been to Ohio once for business, to Cincinnati, where he stayed in a motel that was kind of scary, he explains, leaning in and dropping his voice low, because the whole place was – almost to a whisper now – filled with black people.It can be tauntingly, cloyingly sweet to pass into the club in silence, unchallenged.The word “passing” entered my lexicon in the early days of 1999, when I was eight years old. We had had five snow days in a row, which was almost unheard of. Every night we kept putting our pyjamas on inside-out for luck, and every night it kept raging snow and ice. With the days off, I had read Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin’s account of the way he chemically darkened his skin and then intentionally passed for black while travelling through the deep south in the 1950s.A sprawling, abandoned lot sat across the street from my house, next to a meatpacking plant that made the whole block smell like sausage on Wednesday afternoons. The neighbourhood was a little mecca of multiculturalism in the middle of a ruined midwestern steel town that didn’t mean it was tranquil. In a city split by its river between a predominantly white west side and a black east side, the neighbourhood, which fell just west of the river, was seeing its own racial isions revealed and exacerbated by a nascent onslaught of gentrification. Every block-club meeting became a battle royale for the soul of the neighbourhood, roiling with the tensions between the (white) “social justice gentrifiers”, the (white) “urban warrior gentrifiers” who had followed them a decade later, and the minority residents who preceded both and were slowly being priced out of the few square miles of city they called home.Yet the neighbourhood had still only rounded the first base of gentrification. Though dotted with half-finished, half-million-dollar “townhomes”, it still hosted a shabby, peeling Catholic Worker house and community theatre in the southern half, a big open-air food market to the east, a gay spa and gay nightclub around the corner from my street, and the housing projects on the northern edge by the lake.Each part of the neighbourhood had its characters. There was Shorty, a sometimes – no, mostly – homeless handyman who once saved an elderly couple from a burning house and collected his citizen of the year award in paint-dripped cargo shorts. “Bubby” Hawk, a teenage guy who swore incessantly, had a trick bike pimped out with neon lights and gold handlebars, and who set off bottle rockets next to the browned-out carcasses of the old cars in his house’s yard. The screech from the bottle rockets upset the retired judge and second world war veteran-turned-pacifist down the street because the sound took him back to Normandy, where he had lain shot in the back. A well-off, white investor, who would eventually develop the vacant lot into fortress-like townhomes, loved peeling down the street in his red, vintage Ferrari and would put up the neighbourhood’s sole “BushCheney” sign in front of his house.An evangelical pastor who lived at the intersection of Bubby’s home and the lot had painted, in slightly off-level stencilled red letters, “The John 3:16 Building” on his large but ageing house. The Catholic Workers, with a completely different interpretation of the “Red Letters”, protested against the Cleveland Air Show (or more precisely, the military presence at it) every summer with signs, songs and street theatre. And our neighbourhood mailman (also a Catholic deacon), hosted a legendary fall potluck party in his backyard that, without fail, degenerated into fairly serious drinking with a light touch of pot after midnight.That winter, the lot was still empty, and a pickup kept ploughing the gravel circle in the middle, which meant that the snowbanks it created kept getting higher and higher, reinforced every time it stormed ice. We tunnelled them out and ringed the tunnels with snow-forts. Other kids decided they would knock the forts down, and kick the tunnels in. As they chased me into my house, the words they shouted stuck. “Get whitey!” they yelled.“Yeah, let’s jump this little white boy’s ass.”They had no idea that a few years later, when I became a pre-teen, my mother and I would come close to having the talk.“Look at me,” she would say one day, as if the thought had been squatting at the back of her mind, and she wanted to express it before it got lost. “When you walk out of a store, don’t keep your hands in your pocket. I saw you do that the other day. Things might be different when you’re out with your father, but you don’t want to give anyone any reason or excuse to accuse you of shoplifting.”“You’re a young black man,” she added. “Even if your friends end up fine, you’re the one who will end up in trouble.”But in the winter of 1999, at not quite nine years old, the trouble on my mind was literally on the outside of a glass door, looking in. As the group of boys angrily pelted the house and cars with snow, I held up my middle finger at them, felt my heart beat, stared and determined to myself that there was extraordinarily little that I had in common with them, or wanted to have in common with them.I knew that outside that door, I was physically powerless. As a product of an educated, leftist social circle, I knew – perversely – that my power, a fundamentally greater power, was structural. It lay in my ability to navigate with confidence and ease the codes, institutions and expectations of polite, white, society. The choice between power and powerlessness seemed so clear.I wore successive pairs of neon-yellow running shoes when I was young my group of neighbourhood friends (three white, one black) told me they were “pretty white”. I got good grades, and to my classmates, that too was “pretty white”. The syntax I used, the way I formed words between my tongue and teeth. Pretty white. My favourite song was Everlong by the Foo Fighters, I was building a desktop computer at the weekends, every year I reread practically the entire Tolkien canon. It was all pretty white, pretty white, pretty white.I wrote about the yellow shoes in my college application essay and got into Amherst, an elite liberal arts college in overwhelmingly white western Massachusetts. Because my exam scores qualified me for a national scholarship only available to African American students, I got to cash a $2,500 cheque and didn’t have to join the work-study scheme. And I felt like an impostor, like no matter what I wore, it would always be a disguise.I had crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, where police attacked civil rights protesters in 1965, and grown up reading books like Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I had watched Amistad and newsreels of firehoses pinning protesters against walls while police dogs snapped at their feet and officers bashed their heads in with billy clubs. I had gone to teach-ins about the Children’s March of 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama summer social justice camps about race and class and urban poverty learned about the early civil rights leader Ida B Wells and stepped into sanctuaries that had welcomed Martin Luther King. I knew the lyrics to Go Down Moses, and had celebrated Juneteenth, the holiday that celebrates the end of African American enslavement.And still, I thought, what right did my clear blue eyes – the ones that got me stopped in public by middle-aged women, that brought compliments from security guards and pre-911 trips to the cockpit from flight attendants – what right did those eyes have to inhabit someone else’s struggle, someone else’s pain?It was only years later that I would learn about the myriad moments of discrimination my mother had hidden from me while I was growing up. Like the neighbours who had eventually stopped their children from playing with me when I was five. “Not the chocolate ones,” she had overheard the woman say to her daughter. Or how despite an extremely high score on my entrance exam to Saint Ignatius high school, I had been “overlooked” for the honours programme until my mother had intervened with an admissions officer. The school, she told me just recently, had a history of doing that to minority students.Across geography and time, human cultures have found common ground in their unease with things that are liminal – things that can’t easily be classed and thus neatly ordered. Mary Douglas writes about this in her 1966 anthropology classic, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo, where she dissects cleanliness and uncleanliness, forbidden foods, and things that make us feel uneasy. These are things that straddle definitions, exist between two categories, like animals that parteth the hoof but cheweth not the cud.Philip Roth tells us why his main character in The Human Stain, Coleman Silk, decides to forsake his identity and pass for – become? – a white Jew. “All he’d ever wanted since earliest childhood was to be free: not black, not even white – just on his own and free.” But he can’t be just on his own and free, and so he decides that there is at least more freedom to be had by being white. Coleman Silk decides not to be liminal, not to be a walking, living taboo. Is passing an act of capitulation, or resistance? A rejection of identity, or of identification?The challenge and irony put before those who pass as white is that white is an unspoken norm. Successive waves of immigrants have arrived in the United States and acquired whiteness. The Irish needed not apply, but then they became white. Italians, ostracised and Catholic – they too became white.There is history and heritage in being Scottish or Swedish, Hungarian or Polish, or any other European ethnicity traditionally associated with white skin. White, though – is it anything other than a stand-in for power? A definition for something that needs not be defined, but simply is? Whiteness is never the identified half of a mixed identity. As a girlfriend once observantly pointed out, I have never, ever, reflexively referred to myself as “half-white”, a linguistic construction that is itself active, rather than just is. To paraphrase Larsen, it’s funny about whiteness – in order to claim it, passers have to racialise it, define it, give it some sort of mass and shape. They have to “act white”.But is it even possible to pin down an ontological whiteness?By April, Chad’s dry season, I had to lean my arm way down over the edge of the well, grasping the frayed ends of the rope with fingertips, in order to lower the leather sack down far enough to touch the surface of the water and slowly slip beneath. Dry season near the equator is a series of sun-forced strabismic glances. Months of cursing the sun and wiping your brow repeatedly, until you could swear that the skin there had been worn thin.One day just after the dry season had passed, after water had finally shot down from the sky with such force that it kicked sand up into the air and shook mangoes from trees, I was walking home from the market with two Chadian friends. We stepped to the side of the road to get out of the way of a motorcycle, whose driver sped by in a cloud of dust, his jellaba puffing out around him a chimera, fat with wind.Because we had moved, we were close enough to two little girls sitting on the side of the road to hear them speak. I couldn’t understand their Ngambay, but they were giggling.One of my friends burst into a big, open-mouth laugh. “Those girls,” he told me. “One said, ‘Look, there goes the nasara.’ And the other one said, ‘No, he’s not a nasara, he just looks like one. He’s really Chadian on the inside.’”This article was first published by Hazlitt, the online literary magazine.

It is time to bring grace and generosity back to our national life. At the heart of the Christian message is Jesus’ command to love our neighbour. This includes those with whom we agree and disagree – at home, in Europe, and further afield.“We urge everyone – our political leaders and all of us – to bring magnanimity, respect and reconciliation to our national debate. There is now an urgent need for the United Kingdom to recover a shared vision and identity to help us find a way through the immediate challenges.”The unprecedented statement came as the Conservative MP Jo Johnson called on Theresa May to let MPs vote on her Brexit deal.Johnson accused No 10 of trying to delay the vote on the Brexit deal until the last minute.Johnson, who resigned as transport minister in protest at May’s EU withdrawal agenda, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The time has come for us to hold this vote. I am concerned that No 10 is running down the clock.“Resilience is an admirable quality, and the prime minister has displayed it in abundance, but there comes a point where resilience starts to border on stubbornness and obstinacy, and I’m worried that we are reaching that point.”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.If, instead, the prime minister pushed ahead with plans to delay the vote until January, Johnson said it would in effect be “giving parliament no choice at all, except between her deal – flawed as it is, and facing fundamental opposition across all sides of the house – and no deal at all. And that’s an unacceptable choice for parliament.”May postponed the vote on her Brexit deal earlier this week, admitting concern among her MPs about the Irish backstop proposals would have resulted in her losing the vote by a large margin. The government has promised the vote will take place before 21 January.Johnson said: “We need to get on with it, and the first step is to eliminate her deal from the table. If the vote is deferred again when we come back on Monday, very serious conversations will be had by members of the cabinet and members of parliament asking: ‘Well, what is the strategy?’”.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the Today programme that May’s deal was the only one on the table, “but the thing that the House of Commons will not accept is any risk of us being permanently trapped, through the Northern Irish backstop, in the customs union.“I think it is possible to get this deal through with those guarantees that we need on the backstop.” He said it was within the EU’s interest to avoid a further political crisis in the UK and stop a no-deal scenario.May embarked on a frantic round of European diplomacy in a final attempt to salvage her Brexit deal after delaying the vote, but was largely rebuffed by European leaders who stood firm in their refusal to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. She returned home on Friday having failed to achieve any breakthrough over the backstop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1beea083bd50277615d9759a8fe45832d613721b/0_247_3700_2220/master/3700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29c91d41401090b6a9de3aa979966c12","title":"how would a second brexit referendum work","story":"Mind-boggling complexities over timing, question(s) and how votes would be countedWith parliament gridlocked on a Brexit deal, and time running out before the 29 March deadline, there is increasing focus on a second referendum.Much of the attention so far has focused on the politics of the idea, but there are also complex logistical challenges. Below are the decisions which would have to be made, and hurdles cleared, if there was to be such a vote.It would need new primary legislation, as with the EU Referendum Act 2015, which began the whole process. As well as laying down the legal framework for a second referendum, this would need to spell out details such as the question, the poll date and who would be allowed to vote. The bill can say that some details, such as the date, will be specified later by parliamentary directive.Under the law which lays out rules for such votes, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the Electoral Commission also has to carry out what is called “question testing” – making sure the question asked of voters is the best one.The most thorough assessment of the mechanics of a second Brexit referendum, produced by academics at the constitution unit of University College London, concluded the briefest feasible gap between deciding on such a vote and holding it was 22 weeks. This means a poll date of late May at the earliest.The calculation is that legislation would take 11 weeks: with eight weeks of question testing taking place at the same time a week for transition between the legislation coming into force and the campaign and then a 10-week campaign.Another report into a second referendum, by the People’s Vote group, gives no equivalent figure but argues it should be possible to “condense” elements of the process.Almost inevitably. The official timetable still lays out a UK departure of 29 March, and there will seemingly not be time to hold another public vote before then. Luckily for proponents of a second referendum, the European court of justice ruled last week that the UK can stop the process without seeking EU approval.The main one would be the next European parliament elections in late May. Even if a decision to hold a second referendum was made in January, a 22-week timetable would take it beyond this date. Assuming remain was an option, this would create a quandary: elect new MEPs who may serve only for a month or so or don’t hold elections and potentially leave the UK in the EU without representation.This is where it gets complicated, again. There are four possible options to be sorted: leave under the deal set out leave with no deal seek a new negotiation to leave or stay in the EU.This then opens up several permutations of two-option questions, many of which would be unpalatable either to remainers (the government’s deal or no deal) or to leavers (the government’s deal or remain).Some MPs are therefore pressing for a multi-option referendum, whereby voters could, for example, pick between the government’s deal, no deal, or staying in the EU. It would also be possible to have two successive single-question votes, for example first asking if people accept or reject the deal, and if they decline it, whether they would then prefer no deal or staying in the EU. All these entail extra complications, not least on timing.This is something which has received relatively little attention so far but, as the UCL paper notes, could play a crucial role.This can help decide multi-option polls, but can have complications, not least the risk of eliminating what political scientists call the “condorcet winner” – the choice which if, paired one-to-one with any other option, would be the majority choice.To take one example, it could be possible for the government’s deal to be the overall consensus choice, more popular than both no deal and remain when paired against each, but to not make the final round as the other two have slightly more die-hard supporters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/705fa558e13e536d992947864c59ba01dcc388c8/0_0_8254_6050/master/8254.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8ad8d4ac2a441ae0c8ed01cd61f89cd 480w","title":"royal statistical society christmas quiz 25th anniversary edition","story":"Solving the RSS’s fiendishly tricky festive quiz will require general knowledge, logic and lateral thinkingFor the last quarter-century, the Royal Statistical Society has published a fiendishly difficult Christmas quiz to entertain puzzle fans over the festive break – and this year’s special 25th anniversary edition, devised by Dr Tim Paulden, is sure to get the cogs spinning after a glass or two of mulled wine.

But as we eat the food grown in his garden outside the window, he confesses that he did once see a film. He refuses to disclose what, brushing aside my questions as we sit talking around the dining table with his wife, five of his eight children and one grandson. “I am not proud of that,” he says. “I went against my parents’ wishes.”But this one-off incident, many years ago, speaks to the reasons why this 52-year-old sold his thriving Ohio clothing business, one that supplied hundreds of stores across North America, and moved his family to this idyllic farm in upstate New York three years ago. Daniel is Amish – a member of a community famed worldwide for their plain clothes and use of horse-drawn buggies – and he fears the impact of modernity and the temptations of technology on his children, his church and his traditional Christian world. “Our values are different and we chose to safeguard them,” he says. “But if our people get lax and rub elbows too much with the world, then the world may not look too different – we become like the people outside.”Instead, he has returned to the Amish tradition of farming, enjoying a homespun lifestyle that eschews things the rest of us take for granted – from televisions to trouser belts, in case they distract from a devotion to God. This German-speaking sect, which demands simple lives of self-reliance based on the Bible, may be at odds with the rest of today’s society – yet surprisingly, it is booming, rather than being swamped by a fast-evolving world of smartphones and social media.In 1989, there were some 100,000 Amish scattered in 179 settlements across North America. Recent analysis by academics at Elizabethtown College, Pennsylvania found numbers have surged to 330,265 Amish in 546 settlements. It is the fastest-growing faith group on the continent, with predictions that there might be more than 1 million adherents by 2050. This marks an extraordinary turnaround: there were only 5,000 Amish in America a century ago.Perhaps most remarkably, the reason for this population explosion is not just the traditional big Amish families. Children are actively choosing to stay in communities, resisting the lure of clubs, sport, music and technology. “I’ve heard a lot about Facebook, but it seems a waste of time,” says Michael, 15, one of Daniel’s four sons, over fresh tomato soup. “I can be doing things a lot more beneficial than going to bars or spending time looking at a phone.” Children can choose to be baptised into the church in their late teens – and researchers say retention rates appear to have risen in recent decades.It is not just computers and cars that families turn their backs on. Many Amish reject mains electricity and some refuse indoor plumbing, while wives must follow the decisions of their husbands orce is an impermissible sin. Children carry out chores from infancy. Yet behind those distinctive long beards for men and white bonnets for women, there are some smart business brains, with soaring numbers of multimillionaires. I speak to one man running a firm with 500 employees that he started aged 50 in his barn, while others have become wealthy from land ownership as their population expands, driving up land values.Most Amish people live in small communities of about 20 households, clustered around churches that set their own rules they can now be found in 30 states, as well as Canada, Argentina and Bolivia. “When you have families of 13 people and most stay with the faith, then you end up with lots of people,” says Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor and author of books on the Amish (though she is not Amish herself). “For the most part, I have seen shared labour and a sense of working together that we do not have any more. What I have always most admired is the strength of their families.”A range of factors, from ending the draft in 1973, which forced young Amish men (as conscientious objectors) to carry out community work, through to a more recent trend towards educating Amish children in their own schools, has meant less interaction with the outside world. This has reinforced a sense of separatism and fuelled higher retention rates than in the years before the second world war, when differences with wider society were less stark.New York’s Amish community is among the fastest-growing, with 58 settlements, mainly in the north of the state. Settlers are lured by land cheaper than in the Amish heartlands of Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania – the photogenic backdrop for the film Witness, starring Harrison Ford as a police officer hiding in the community. In the small market town of Morris, where the Weavers now live, there are seven Amish households in an area that has seen scores of small farms go out of business.But their neighbours seem to welcome them, not least because they have revived derelict farms. “They are well liked here,” says Leslie Stroh, a publisher who worked on Daniel’s fields as a boy. “They don’t integrate, and why should they? But they are still very open to us.” There have been tensions in other places, however, over issues such as horse droppings on roads, and refusing to install hazard lights on buggies.Stopping in the centre of this quiet town, I meet an elderly Amish man visiting the post office on his bicycle, who turns out to be Daniel’s father, Roy. A widower who moved here a year ago, following his son, he politely answers my questions and talks me through some of the Amish community’s basic beliefs – about following “the old ways” as set out in the Bible. Later I learn the family was driven to move by cheaper land, tensions over technology in their previous church, and Daniel’s desire to spend more time with his family. He is building a store to sell local produce, while Sam, his eldest son, runs a dairy farm.That evening, Daniel asks me to join his household for dinner, an unusual invitation. But the meal is punctuated by laughter, as the Weavers describe a way of life that revolves around faith, family and work. “I feel you can be trusted, so you are sitting at my table,” Daniel says. “But on a friendship level, our values are very different. We would not want to mix with you, because if our children came to your home, they might sit and watch television.”We discuss their attitudes to issues such as girls’ and women’s rights, the conversation carrying on into the following day. “The Bible says a husband must love his wife and if a wife follows his lead then you will have a happy family,” says Sam, 28, a father of four. “If God’s ways are followed, then a contented family will result under our culture.” When I press him on the fairness of this, he argues they are all – men and women alike – following ine command. While the family insist all key decisions are shared, it is noticeable that the women are reticent in these male-dominated discussions. They are also more likely to carry out the traditional tasks of cleaning and cooking. Ira, Daniel’s wife, describes her day to me: “quiet time praying”, then “the girls help with breakfast and we are done by seven so the men can go out.” Her husband tells me Ira is not a “women’s libber”.The couple’s lively one-year-old grandson, Nathan, joins us at the table, along with his father, Josh. His wife – Daniel and Ira’s oldest daughter – died of Hodgkin lymphoma when she was just 23, soon after the boy’s birth. They tell me this was deeply painful and that they miss her profoundly, but believe there is a higher purpose to such loss. “To us, death is not God’s punishment. God is in control of life and death,” Daniel says.The Amish are followers of Jacob Amman, a hardline Swiss bishop who broke with the Mennonite faith in 1693. The Amish began emigrating to America in the 18th century, mostly settling in Pennsylvania. In the 1930s, they came to wider attention and were romanticised for resisting moves to shut down the small schools their children attended. Later generations have found other aspects of their lifestyle to admire: in the 60s, counterculture rebels looked to them as off-grid pioneers in the 80s, they were celebrated for their traditional craft skills more recently, it’s been their long tradition of organic farming, with branded grocers opening in New York City.Outsiders are allowed to join the community – though only an estimated one in three stick with the creed they are encouraged to spend time living the Amish lifestyle for several months before baptism into the church.Converts include Marlene Miller, a former high school majorette who joined half a century ago, after marrying an Amish man. In a memoir, she wrote that the hardest things were learning to speak German and to sew just three of her 10 children are still in the faith.Although clearly devout, with hymn sheets stuck to his own kitchen table for the family to sing together, Sam admits to me the day after our dinner that, as a teenager, he questioned his belief – if it “was a learned thing rather than the truth”. He has friends who have left to join “the English” – the Amish term for outsiders. He also confesses that, as a bird-watcher, he would love to have a camera. “But our values are down to our connection to a faith that will be discarded if we adopt technology.”Sam, who has travelled abroad, says he is old enough to remember a pre-digital era, before computers and smartphones. “I can see the big changes they have brought to society, which my children will never see. There is more independence on the inidual level, but people have become more selfish – everything is for themselves. We value the idea of working for the betterment of everyone. Christ said we are to be a light to the world. We are not saying we want everyone to be Amish, or that we are better, but our goal in a selfish society is to show people that it works if we are honest in our dealings, respect people and go the extra mile.”Watching him lead one of his young sons around the lush fields and milking his cows, assisted by a younger brother and automated machinery, it’s clear this thoughtful man loves the rural way of life, with his 800 cows and renovated old buildings. He is scathing, however, about industrialised farming, with tens of thousands of cattle in one place. “In America, we are so driven by capitalism that everything has to get bigger and bigger all the time,” he says.They may use a horse and buggy for trips into town, clip-clopping along the roads alongside thundering trucks, but the Amish will take taxis and trains when needed. I am surprised to learn that both Sam and Daniel have flown abroad, to places such as Guatemala and Haiti for charity work. Daniel explains that the Amish reject many modern items for fear of assimilation. So they do not own cars, for instance, because the machines detach people from their extended families too easily and can create envy, not because they are deemed “sinful” in themselves.Daniel does not buy a newspaper, because he does not want his children becoming interested in sport – “sport seems to be the God of America, so competitive and with so much money” – yet they play volleyball and he will happily read a paper if he finds one on a train. So they know about their disruptive president, despite opting out of the electoral process. Yet when I mention Donald Trump’s bellicose language on North Korea, one young adult asks me if his country has gone to war.Given the world’s political turbulence, such ignorance might sound almost blissful. But some who leave the Amish community have spoken about a dark side to the peaceable Amish facade people who leave the church can be shunned by their families for the rest of their lives. I am told of one person, for instance, who was recently barred from attending her own mother’s funeral, having walked out of the sect.Former church member Ira Wagler wrote a bestseller called Growing Up Amish, the story of how he stole away in the middle of the night, aged 17 – finally quitting the church nine years later, on his fifth attempt. “People put the Amish on a pedestal but they are just people,” he tells me. “There are some very good things about their culture that I respect, now I have joined the real world. I was taken to the top of our house, given a goose wing and made to sweep steps as my job when I was only three. The message is you do not deserve anything unless it’s earned. But if someone’s barn burns down, you help rebuild it.”Wagler tells me that Amish children have little sense of the outside world. “My childhood had great security, with black-and-white boundaries in a very warm community. It was on a farm, so we worked and played – out in the fields or fishing in the creeks. I have very warm memories.” But he points out the flipside of such isolation, and the intense pressure to stay loyal to the church. “It is mind control. You knew that if you stepped outside the culture you’d go to hell. It was only in my mid-20s that I realised: you don’t have to be Amish.”Like others, he talks about the impact of technology, which many Amish recognise has confronted them with existential dilemmas. Some already use mobile phones children are secretly using social media and those with businesses often need email and a website. Meanwhile, firms and retailers are using notes and coins less a cashless society could ultimately force even the most conservative groups to adopt technology.“The smartphone is a threat to the Amish not only for the darker aspects of the internet, such as access to pornography, but also for the way it can change the way we behave,” says Erik Wesner, founder of the authoritative Amish America website. “We have all got quickly used to finding instant solutions online. These can erode traditional values that the Amish revere, such as patience and dependence upon their community. And unlike a car or pickup truck, a smartphone is easily hidden.”Yet Wesner believes the Amish will adapt, with more conservative groups resisting the digital age for as long as possible, just as some still resist electricity and modern plumbing while the majority retain defining markers such as austere clothing and a ban on car ownership. “They do gradually change, although at slower pace.”One comparatively recent adaptation has been the shift from farming to business. One study found more than 10,000 Amish-owned firms across the US – with lower failure rates than average, despite the fact that most Amish leave school at 14, making them unlikely entrepreneurs.One of the biggest is a kitchen cabinet business started by Ola Yoder in his barn two decades ago. It now churns out 6,000 units a day from an industrial park in Indiana, employing 500 staff. Unusually, Yoder, now 72, spent seven years outside the Amish in his early 20s. “I saw how other people lived and decided it was not for me or my kids,” he says, although he still has many “English” friends. He also spent time working for a major company. “They had rules about drugs and swearing, but no one enforced them,” he says. “In corporate America, it is all about climbing up the ladder.”Yoder bans mobile phones at work, asking why you would want to employ someone who is always texting, and says he sticks to Amish values in business. “Success is about finding peace within yourself and your family. For the Amish, money is just a tool to enable you to live your faith. What good would it do, to have smart cars and fly all over the world?”Before I leave Morris, with its rolling farmland and warning signs urging drivers to beware of horse-drawn buggies, Daniel tells me he knows outsiders think their approach to life looks outdated and tough. “But all those seeking freedom seem to have more traps than ever – all their cars, computers and televisions seem to make their lives more morose,” he says. “I think our lifestyle is actually easier.”That may be true. But only time will tell, as their numbers continue to rise, whether they can hold out against what Sam Weaver calls “the glitz and glamour” of the modern world.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b23cbd97a8fadec654028aaa138602894ac59a/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d702bff9e09f29652a3c618c249ab1","title":"speak guardian observer journalists charity telethon lines","story":"Marina Hyde, Gary Younge, Katharine Viner and Owen Jones will be among those waiting for your callsWould you like to speak to Marina Hyde, Gary Younge, Katharine Viner or Owen Jones?All four and many more of your favourite journalists will be staffing the 2018  and Observer charity telethon phone lines this Saturday to take your calls and donations.This year we are raising money for five brilliant charities that helped to expose the Windrush scandal and continue to help the thousands of people who have been tipped into poverty, homelessness and destitution by cruel hostile environment immigration policies. and Observer editor-in-chief will also be joined on the phones by Polly Toynbee, Hadley Freeman, Jonathan Freedland, Sali Hughes, the Observer editor Paul Webster, Jess Cartner-Morley, John Crace and Peter Bradshaw.You can call from 10am to 6pm on 020 3353 4368.

The family smiled and hugged before they joined her in an ambulance for a medical check-up in the port city.The 29-year-old was the youngest entrant and the only woman in the Golden Globe Race that began on 1 July in Les Sables-d’Olonne, France.A violent storm ripped off her mast and overturned her boat on 5 December. Race officials were in regular radio contact with Goodall, who was near the southern tip of South America when the storm occurred. She was rescued two days later by the Tian Fu, a cargo vessel from China.In a statement on her website on Friday evening, Goodall said: “If you asked me if I would do this again, now knowing what it’s really like, I would say ‘yes’ in a heartbeat! You may ask why?! Some people just live for adventure – it’s human nature. And, for me, the sea is where my adventure lies. Every seafarer understands the risks involved but that’s what makes us stronger and able to overcome other challenges in life.”Goodall thanked all the people who had helped rescue her, including the captain, crew and owners of Tian Fu.She added: “After arriving in Punta Arenas today, I’m still a little wobbly both emotionally and physically as I find my land legs again.“I arrived with a heavy heart, no longer a competitor in the Golden Globe Race – but here is certainly a lot better than the alternative. And I wouldn’t be here today without the incredible support and seamanship shown by so many people over the past 10 days.“Sailing away from DHL Starlight was heartbreaking, she stood up valiantly to all that the elements had to throw at her and looked after me until the last.”Goodall said she was fighting back tears when she stepped off the Tian Fu and saw her mother and brother . She said her family had been her “rock” from when she signed up to the race and thanked them for their support.Goodall said: “After 157 days alone at sea and a very emotional week to follow, I was fighting back the tears as I stepped off the ship and saw my mum and oldest brother. I have put them through a lot, and I know I have a lot of making up to do! But I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for believing in and supporting me in the many, many ways they have – thank you.”: “I can’t tell you what is next beyond spending time with family and friends over Christmas and enjoying a glass of glogg, but that fire in my belly is far from out, so watch this space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f3db44345765b4564f1fdec4c429a85e90da43a/0_148_5052_3031/master/5052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a99efa1db22869ce7a7efd7a6f62272","title":"virat kohli shows class in face of quality australian bowling","story":"Virat Kohli has provided predictably composed resistance in the second Test, classily conquering some quality bowling as India reached 3-172 and trimmed Australia’s lead to 154 runs at stumps on day two in Perth.The four-Test series was almost billed as a battle between Australia and Kohli, such were the headlines and hype about the world’s best batsman with an outstanding record in this country.Kohli scored three and 34 during India’s series-opening victory at Adelaide Oval, a reminder the world No.1 Test side boasted plenty of other threats.But at Optus Stadium on Saturday there was no underplaying the importance of one inidual, whose ongoing attritional battle with arguably the world’s best attack has the potential to decide the contest.Kohli finished 82 not out, steadying superbly after Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood rattled stumps, removed openers and reduced India to 2-8.The superstar, metaphorically and literally on the front foot given he was batting well outside his crease despite the pace and threat posed by Starc and Hazlewood in their opening spells, required just nine balls to stroke four well-timed boundaries and deliver the latest reminder of his immense talent.The hosts won the next round. There wasn’t a single boundary in the next 21 overs and the captain’s strike-rate dipped.Australia’s quicks beat his bat semi-regularly, a couple of edges fell short of fielders, while Kohli boldly shouldered arms to a Nathan Lyon offspinner that turned sharply and almost kissed the top of off stump.Kolhi twice required treatment in Saturday’s final session, after a blow to the elbow then a scrape resulting from a e necessitated by a mix-up between the wickets with Ajinkya Rahane.The right-hander shooed physio Patrick Farhart away with disdain both times then reasserted his dominance by putting away a couple of the few loose balls provided on Saturday.Kohli and Rahane’s stand is already worth 90 runs and has the potential to become match-winning on Sunday, when the second new ball is available in 11 overs.“This is the partnership they just need to break,” Ricky Ponting said on Seven.Rahane, unbeaten on 51 after copping a painful blow to the right thumb inflicted by Hazlewood, and Cheteshwar Pujara, who fell in uncharacteristically tame fashion on 24 when caught behind down the leg side, helped Kohli nudge India closer to first-innings parity.“It’s just about being patient,” Aaron Finch told Fox, praising Australia’s bowlers.Earlier, Australia lost 4-16 to finish all out for 326 in their first innings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed990bbe980f12713abf974728d748d45892fe3/0_0_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89fac9b9384cb2c200f80e8f8e5d0308","title":"hockey world cup 2018 england belgium semi final live","story":"That’s it for our Men’s Hockey World Cup semi-final coverage.

The hooter puts and end to a humiliating defeat for England. Belgium dominated from start to finish and earn their first ever World Cup final berth with goals in every quarter.58 min Van Doren finally gets a tackle wrong and England get the chance to score a consolation from a penalty corner. Ansell gathers but puts his effort wide.57 min Pinner is called into action again as Boucard salvages a loose pass to find Charlier in space. Bearing down on goal the forward tries to beat the keeper at his near post but Pinner gets a strong glove on it.55 min Penalty corner for England again but unlike Belgium they cannot make it count, they could be shutout here.53 min Van Doren has been majestic for Belgium whenever England look like create something the HC Bloemendaal man is there to snuff it out. He makes another key tackle and Belgium are quickly up the other end with Dockier. The forward gets his shot off as he breaks into the D and fires high past Pinner. This is a rout.50 min Despite the man advantage its Belgium who break forward and they get another penalty corner as the ball strikes Hoare’s foot. Hendrickx is ruthless again from the set-piece, this time firing high into the net past a helpless Pinner. 48 min England’s passes are just not finding men but they have a chance to create something as Gougnard sees green. Belgium retreat into their own 23 and look to keep it compact.The hooter finally goes, just 15 minutes left for England to salvage anything from this game.45 min With the hooter seconds away England concede a penalty corner and Hendrickx takes the push and fires past Pinner. If it wasn’t over before it’d definitely done now.44 min Vanasch makes the save from the set-piece and it’s scrambled away. On the break Belgium look nailed on for a fourth as they overload a stretched England defence but Boucard can’t finish.43 min Penalty corner for England as Ansell forces a stick tackle in the D. 42 min Out of nowhere Belgium get the third! An aerial pass is not dealt with by England and Cedric Charlier is able to collect and fire on the half-volley past Pinner. That’s surely enough for Belgium.41 min The answer is no and the Belgians are back to full strength. England did manage a shot in anger but Condon’s wild effort is blocked.39 min Van Aubel heads to the bin for two minutes after a foul on Ansell. Can England make the man advantage count?37 mis Belgium are prepared to be patient with the buffer of a 2-0 lead , just moving the ball around midfield and keeping England at arm’s length.32 min Adam Dixon is the man to fire at goal but it’s blocked on the line with Vanasch beaten! Middleton can’t gather the ball on the rebound and Belgium get the whistle for the foot. That was positive for England as they played with some speed through the lines to earn the set-piece.31 min We’re back underway at the Kalinga Stadium and immediately look England brighter and they have a penalty corner!England reach the break and find themselves lucky to be only two down. Danny Kerry has to get his team doing something different in the second if they’re to turn this around. England are struggling to get any kind of attacking momentum so far, Belgium are pressing high and look dangerous whenever they come forward.28 min That should have been Belgium’s third. England give the ball away in their own 23 and as they scramble to get back into defensive position there are holes all over the place. Floren van Aubel cleverly feeds Sebastien Dockier and it looks like he can’t miss as lines up the shot from a metre out but the striker scuffs his sweep and holds his head in his hands as the ball goes wide. England need the hooter.26 min Just as England look like they’re able to create some pressure with back-to-back free hits in the Belgian 23, Mark Gleghorne is unable to bring an aerial pass out to the left and the ball runs out of play which rather sums up his side’s performance.21 min Just as England create an overload on right and looks to have men in the Belgium D Arthur Van Doren comes in with a perfectly timed tackle to nick the ball and snuff out the danger.20 min Belgium win a penalty corner for a foot and although Pinner makes the initial save from Alex Hendrickx but Simon Gougnard picks up the rebound and flashes the ball past the keeper from the angle. It’s only a fair reflection of the game to this point.16 min First bit of excitement for England. Waller beats four men with some very pretty work down in his own 23. He drives forward and feeds Middleton who carries into the Belgium area but can’t squeeze the ball into a teammate.England get into the first break just the single goal down but it could have been much worse.13 min Off the bar! Real let-off for England as a ing Boon deflects a fierce long-range drive on to the post. The resulting scramble sees Pinner recover the ball as it drops back to the turf. 12 min England are struggling to make any inroads into the Belgium 23. There don’t seem to be any spaces for the likes of Middleton to operate in. England are yet to trouble Vincent Vanasch in the Belgium goal.9 min Tom Boon strikes an early blow to England’s chances as he finishes off a sweeping Belgium move. The ball came in from the left and and the striker was on-hand to turn it past George Pinner from close range. Disaster for Danny Kerry’s side.8 min England give the ball away in midfield and Charlier looks like he’s got a clear run in at goal but Jack Waller gets back to make a crucial tackle and snuff out the danger3 min It’s been all Belgium since the off but so far possession has been just probing.Good morning, welcome to our live coverage of the 2018 Men’s Hockey World Cup semi-final.

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin. I serve it with pickled cockle popcorn – it’s a fantastic pairing – with clove or orange added to the cognac to give it a seasonal twist.”Try Bosi’s cognac and pickled cockle pairing (and other seasonal cognac cocktails and food pairings) at Rémy Martin residency at Claude Bosi at Bibendum6. Polly Hadden-Paton, professional organiser to Suki Waterhouse and Lily Allen“I like to keep a few nice bottles, scented candles or tins of biscuits wrapped up in a drawer as fallback presents in case someone unexpectedly buys you something. And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up. Trees are like flowers, they need water to stay fresh, so give your tree up to a litre of water every couple of days for the first few days, and then a litre once a week after that.”Whether you need to impress last-minute guests with some fun, festive cocktails or take Hadden-Paton’s advice and stock up on a few bottles of something smart to keep as emergency gifts, Rémy Martin could just be your ultimate seasonal save – the key ingredient to Bosi’s cocktail menu, the perfect accompaniment to pickled cockle popcorn (of course) and a rather elegant gift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2023de63811aee4a9d67e5f9b10f3e4797ff3b14/0_54_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d8faa07753c074dcaf2e59778857ab","title":"send us a tip on a uk winter walk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"A good walk and fresh air are perfect for blowing away the Christmas cobwebs.

Earlier this year, however, he entered a different kind of world: the alleged sex ring run by R Kelly (which he denies). By speaking with those who have worked with the R\u0026ampB artist over the past two decades, Zand attempted to delve into the cloud of allegations surrounding the singer to unveil some kind of truth.He is now pursuing a similar technique in Searching for Kanye (BBC Three, from Sunday), striking at the moment in the rapper’s career when even his most loyal fans are beginning to turn against him. West, of course, is no stranger to being incredibly wrong. He once said he was “a proud non-reader of books” because “I would never want a book’s autograph”. In 2016, he tweeted that Bill Cosby was innocent. But for all his Dapper Laughs ramblings and Lee Ryan philistinism, Kanye could be wondrous. He is a master of language who can create commanding prose his interviews could be as captivating as his verses. Often the delivery of his monologues was more impressive than the information within them as he himself once said: “I’m not saying I have answers, these are just my current opinions.”Most importantly, his musical output was unparalleled one of the greatest artists of our times. Kanye’s unbearable side was like a bad hangover, a potential risk but one that could be mitigated through moderation.This year he became hard to avoid: a loud, consistent support for Trump and a man who made bizarre comments about slavery. At the same time, he released a string of albums of varying quality, and this month dropped a track on the posthumous XXXTentacion album. The lyrics received criticism from those who felt he was questioning why female accusers of harassment don’t receive more blame (“Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin’  The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff”).In order for Zand to insert himself into the Kanye saga, he visits Chicago to interview the people he grew up with as well as collaborators and targets of his ire, to try to understand the rapper’s views on race, politics and mental health. The BBC would not make previews of the documentary available to us but Zand has spoken to West’s cousin Tony Williams, Chicago rapper and childhood friend GLC, conservative campaigner Candace Owens, and the son of the late Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, Fred Hampton Jr, to “try and unravel what is really going on in his head”.Like Asif Kapadia’s Amy Winehouse documentary, perhaps Kanye’s upbringing will provide answers to his current situation: both his parents were active in the Black Panther movement could this help us understand his confusing political stance? Whatever is unearthed will be an improvement on the current confusion surrounding the rapper. Right now, Kanye is such a mess of contradictions, hopefully the people who know him will be able to shed light on his move into rightwing politics, when West himself seems so unable to explain his actions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7919326acfb24d6b6fe8fadd1f2e1986e9a8835/0_53_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9913364e21fbad0302c8cded716e1cc0","title":"miss usa apologizes mocking fellow competitors","story":"Sarah Rose Summers admits she disrespected Cambodian and Vietnamese contestantsThe woman who holds the Miss USA 2018 title has apologized after she was captured on video mocking two of her fellow competitors for their English-speaking skills.In a video posted to Instagram, Sarah Rose Summers made light of Nat Rern, Miss Cambodia and H’Hen Nie, Miss Vietnam. In the video, she said of Nie: “She’s so cute and she pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes …” she said before mimicking a confused nod and smile.Then Summers makes fun of another contestant for not speaking English, apparently unaware that the language is not universally understood around the world.“Miss Cambodia is here and doesn’t speak any English and not a single other person speaks her language.

A reminder that you’re participating in a competition in a countrycontinent where English is NOT the primary language.”After a spate of backlash, Summers offered an apology on Friday.The Miss Universe competition “is an opportunity for women from around the world to learn about each other’s cultures, life experiences, and views,” she wrote. “We all come from different backgrounds and can grow alongside one another.”“In a moment where I intended to admire the courage of a few of my sisters, I said something that I now realize can be perceived as not respectful, and I apologize.

But she has campaigned as a union activist against any attempt to privatize the capital’s giant public transit system – even after she suffered a stroke last year. After all, she believes life is much better for transit workers outside the private sector.“We want to be city-owned, have city benefits, in the long term, not just by contract. You can’t have that with these contractors,” she said. “We should be a city-owned company, we provide a city-owned service.”The fight over who owns and runs public transit in Washington DC has been a long struggle that has seen an ebb and flow of privatization efforts in the fourth largest public transit system in the United States. In the 1970s, the capital’s politan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) took over private bus operations in the wake of rampant abuses and safety issues caused by private contractors.But now WMATA has increasingly shifted back toward favoring privatisation of some of its operations. In August, WMATA’s  Bus entered its first contract under a private contractor a five-year, $89m contract with TransDev, a French-based transportation company. Union members opposed the deal, and fear it could pave the way to further privatization.WMATA is also looking to make its Silver Line extension the first subway line in the United States to be under a private contract. The line is currently considering proposals from private contractors to operate and maintain the six-station line scheduled to open in 2020.These contracts with private corporations come at a cost to the public, argue drivers and labor organizers fighting to keep the DC transit system public.Within WMATA’s Access Paratransit service – which helps disabled people access a shared-ride service – drivers cite high employee turnover, forced overtime hours and lower benefits after it became one of the first operations to come under private contract.“They just keep hiring because they keep firing. They can’t keep anybody,” said Kimberly Wilson Lynch, a Access Paratransit driver for six years.Drivers are scheduled to work in 12-hour shifts, but Lynch noted she often goes beyond that time, sometimes up to 16 hours in a single shift.“You get an hour break, and we’re supposed to get two 15-minute breaks, which we don’t get,” she said. Lynch also explained drivers have to call in to ask permission to stop to use the bathroom during their shift, which dispatch frequently won’t authorize.“The way they treat the drivers is unbelievable,” said Genoa Greene, a Access Paratransit driver for 12 years. As a union steward, Greene explained she often has to fight wrongful terminations of drivers, and drivers often work sick due to only receiving two days of sick leave per year.Greene noted riders are negatively affected by how the private contractor runs the paratransit service. According to Greene, clients are often still scheduled for rides after death, or wrongly listed as using a wheelchair because it is profitable for the private contractor. “I go to this client’s home. The wife was livid. I go knock on the door. She said the client has been dead for five years,” Greene recounted.A WMATA spokesperson told the  in an email: “ is committed to ensuring the best possible paratransit service for our Access customers, something we enforce through rigorous standards, including those related to safety, performance, and efficiency, outlined in each contract.“We use contractors to facilitate the scheduling and delivery of trips on Access, but maintain full oversight and responsibility to ensure our providers adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for all aspects of Access service.”TransDev did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Private contractors have won contracts from WMATA under promises of saving money. But unions claim the contracts result in lower wages for workers and poor maintenance of the transit system. They also point to service cuts in communities where the ridership is predominantly people of color from a low-income background.“We got involved in the transit fight because it was wrong on so many levels. It was an attack on the livelihood of middle-class folks, in particular, black middle class because the majority of the drivers are African American,” said the Rev Lionel Edmonds, a pastor at Mount Lebanon Baptist church and co-founder of the Washington Interfaith Network.“Most of the lines being talked about cutting are in poor areas,” added Edmonds. “They say it’s going to make the city better but they never say who it’s going to hurt.”Some religious leaders were inspired to action after bus routes in their communities were slated for cuts.In suburban Vienna, Virginia, a bus line was cut that served hundreds of low-incoming housing units. “This bus route was the only way for them to get groceries, get to work.

His comments were echoed by Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, who described it as a “reckless move” and said Morrison was trying to save face.On Saturday evening Wong released a statement describing the move as “all risk and no gain” and tweeted: “Labor does not support unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and in government would reverse this decision. The status of Jerusalem can only be resolved as part of any peace negotiations and two-state solution.”Last week Palestinian leaders were lobbying Arab and other Muslim states to drop Australian exports and withdraw their ambassadors from Canberra in the event of an embassy move to Jerusalem.While the government has delayed the more controversial embassy relocation, Australia will establish a defence and trade office in Jerusalem and start looking for an embassy site.He said neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians viewed the other as a genuine partner for peace.“Though, a two-state solution remains the only viable way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute,” he said. “The obstacles, we must admit, to achieving such a solution are becoming insurmountable. We hope not. The lapse of time and the failure to progress the negotiations I believe has changed this Israeli-Palestinian situation in recent times. A rancid stalemate has emerged.“Slavish adherence to the conventional wisdom over decades appears only to be further entrenching the stalemate, providing for everyone just to keep doing what they were doing and looking the other way … that’s not the way I deal with problems.”Morrison also accused the United Nations of antisemitism, saying: “We regard the biased and unfair targeting of Israel in the UN general assembly in particular, as deeply unhelpful to efforts to build peace and stability. The UN general assembly is now the place where Israel is bullied and where antisemitism is cloaked in the language of human rights.”Both Israel and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital.Most foreign nations avoided moving embassies there to prevent inflaming peace talks on the city’s final status – until Trump unilaterally moved the US embassy there earlier this year.The relocation was condemned by US allies, Palestinian leaders and the Muslim world. It sparked massive protests in Gaza which resulted in the deaths of 58 Palestinians. Ever since Donald Trump’s declaration in December last year, Israel has been pushing hard to persuade other countries to follow.On Saturday the president of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network, Bishop George Browning, said Morrison’s announcement was “a tortuous attempt to salvage himself from a pre-emptive thought bubble prior to the Wentworth byelection”.“In other words Australia may somewhat pompously say it is all fine, we are only moving into West Jerusalem – Israel considers Jerusalem to be unided. If the prime minister’s words are to have any meaning he and Australia will need to be far more proactive – if necessary through sanctions and boycotts – to pressure Israel into a genuine commitment to peace and the recognition of Palestinian rights, specifically in East Jerusalem.”But the announcement was described as a “positive step forward” by chair of the Australia-Israel Parliamentary Group, the Tasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz.“Clearly the status quo of sitting back has not worked for the last 20 years and the government’s decision to be more actively involved especially at a time when the United Nations has been stepping up its biased attacks against Israel is positive,” Abetz said.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat urged the Australian government to “stay the course with international law and agreements signed between Palestinians and Israelis”. On Tuesday morning, Erekat wrote: “I call upon all Arab and Muslim countries to sever all relations with with Australia, if it recognises Jerusalem as Israel’s capital,” adding that Arab and Muslim countries had adopted a resolution to cut ties with any country to do so.There are serious concerns Morrison’s announcement could have trade implications, with Saudi Arabia the largest importer of live meat from Australia, and that it could also jeopardise the signing of a critical free-trade deal with Indonesia. In October Malaysia warned moving the embassy could fuel terrorism.In October, the former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, warned the government has “got to be careful” around Israel policy, because many countries that import Australian agricultural exports including Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan have “lots of sensitivities here”.In October, Australia’s spy agency Asio warned any embassy move may “provoke protest, unrest and possibly some violence in Gaza and the West Bank”.Taylor added: “Given that both Morrison and Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo will face robust elections in early-mid 2019 – during which time their respective hardline conservatives are now pushing hard for their leaders to show strength on the issue of Jerusalem – it was folly for Australia’s prime minister to even raise the issue at this time, as it was always going to ‘wedge’ both leaders, with no satisfactory outcome.”On Saturday the Australian Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, described Morrison’s announcement as “irresponsible” and “another body blow for the peace process and for the Palestinian people”.The former prime minister Kevin Rudd tweeted on Saturday that Morrison’s announcement was “A politically craven decision by a failing prime minister to appease Netanyahu’s far right Israeli govt \u0026amp far right lobby in Oz. A reminder: this is the same Netanyahu who presided over forging Oz passports for use in Mossad’s 2009 assassination in Dubai.”In October, Morrison said he was “open to” the embassy move, describing it as a “sensible” proposal. An evangelical Christian, Morrison immediately faced questions about whether his religious views had played a part in his decision to float the proposal. “My faith and religion has nothing to do with this decision,” he said.The government said the embassy proposal was flagged due to a vote on the UN general assembly resolution on the Palestinian Authority chairing the G77. But the byelection in Wentworth, once held by ousted PM Malcolm Turnbull, was also widely considered a factor.Phelps said at the time the policy was nothing more than “a politically motivated move”.On Saturday a spokeswoman for Jews Against the Occupation Sydney, Vivienne Porzsolt, said Morrison’s move to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital without immediately moving the embassy was “a welcome backdown from an ill-considered proposal announced in the heat of a byelection”.“It would have had disastrous consequences and rightly was condemned on all sides,” she told  Australia.“However, it would be much more relevant to immediately recognise Palestine which hopefully the national conference of the ALP this week will adopt as policy.“The continuing alignment of Australia with the Israeli government and its extreme rightwing policies and the proposed build-up of mutual trade and ‘defence’ relationships is a serious barrier to a just peace and an end to the Israeli occupation with its continuing murders, dispossession and total denial of the rights of the Palestinians.”Also in his speech on Saturday, Morrison spoke about the Iran nuclear deal, which he has previously said he was open to reviewing.“Our concerns about Iran relate not to what’s in the agreement but what’s not in the agreement,” he said. “The agreement does not address Iran’s destabilising activities in the Middle East and beyond. It does not address Iran’s proliferation of ballistic missiles and technology, and support for terrorist groups. These are activities that the global community must act on.”Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddd29703a5fd5ee24054dedd6f652d0986ca86ca/0_189_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=361ca065851d57c28e41533d5c1e8df6","title":"year celebrities held to account kevin hart","story":"From Kevin Hart to Lena Dunham to Christmas songs, sometimes it’s a good idea to look critically at the past. But you can’t just ban everythingIf 2016 was the year of the celebrity death, and 2017 the year of the celebrity sex scandal, then 2018 has been the year celebrities have been held to account for things they said in the past that no longer wash in these suddenly, if somewhat belatedly, enlightened times. Quite what to do next remains slightly TBD.Many high-profile comedians have come under this kind of fire, from Sarah Silverman to Amy Schumer to Ricky Gervais, and last week it was the turn of Kevin Hart. He lasted precisely two seconds as the named host of the 2019 Oscars before his prior fondness for outrageously homophobic comedy, including a routine about how awful it would be to have a gay child, and his predilection for similarly hilarious witticisms on Twitter (including one tweet describing someone as looking like “a gay billboard for Aids”) were deemed, as the modern lingo goes, problematic.Hart initially refused to apologise, saying “I am truly happy people… there is nothing that you can do to change that… You LIVE and YOU LEARN \u0026amp YOU GROW \u0026amp YOU MATURE.” (Hart has no problem with a man loving a man, as long as both of those men are him.) Whether he has matured since making the 2015 “comedy” Get Hard, the most homophobic movie I’ve seen since the 1980s, was not explained, although given his resistance to the word sorry, probably not. Eventually, Hart – or someone in Hart’s retinue – decided this didn’t need to be the hill he died on, and he apologised for his “insensitive words” and stepped down from the Oscars.Some have come to his defence, saying previous Oscar nominees have done worse, and that’s true, but the whole point of #MeToo was to raise the standards. There have been the usual complaints that it’s unfair to hold work from the past to modern values, which is also true to a certain extent: only the most determinedly offended can be outraged by, say, the lack of ersity in Jane Austen’s novels, as some students reportedly are now. But complaining that a comedian shouldn’t be criticised for having been homophobic, er, a few years ago, is the updated version of older men insisting that sexual harassment was totally fine in the 1970s, because, well, they wanted it to be.As Hart was quitting the Oscars, two other furores were brewing over things that are now deemed unacceptable: Lena Dunham – who hasn’t said something without causing offence since about 2013 – and the Christmas classic Baby It’s Cold Outside, proving the potentially offensive is a truly broad church these days. And both of these cases revealed something about the perils of this new enthusiasm for outrage.Dunham was recently criticised for her open apology to Aurora Perrineau, who last year accused Murray Miller, formerly a writer on Girls, of assaulting her, which Miller denies. Dunham publicly dismissed Perrineau’s claim, but now admits that was a “mistake” and thanked Perrineau for making her “a better woman and a better feminist”, as if Dunham’s emotional growth is the story here.Whereas Hart’s reluctance to admit wrongdoing showed his arrogance, Dunham’s enthusiasm about doing so revealed a modern form of narcissism. Her mistake, like Louis CK before her, was to make her apology about herself. This may be a reflection of how those in this kind of spotlight now feel so under attack that in their eyes they are the victims. But that is hardly an excuse.Objections have been growing for years to Baby It’s Cold Outside, in particular its lyrics “Say, what’s in this drink?”. The song, once thought of as a jolly festive duet, is now regularly damned as a paean to spiked drinks, AKA date rape, and this year one US radio station banned it. “In a world where #MeToo has finally given women the voice they deserve, the song has no place,” decreed host Glenn Anderson. It’s always amusing when a man tells women what they need to be protected from. Alas for the station, one particular woman, songwriter Frank Loesser’s daughter Susan, used her voice to point out that they were talking nonsense. As she explained, the song was written in 1944, when women had little sexual freedom, so the song is actually about a man and a woman coming up with silly excuses so she can stay – like, it’s cold outside, and she’s drunk. A song that is now being condemned for being “rapey” was actually about a reach towards sexual liberation.Outrage is a helluva drug, and the Baby It’s Cold Outside palaver is a handy reminder of just how blunt a tool it is, and how ludicrous it is to ban things deemed offensive. Neither Hart nor Dunham have been banned from anything they have been called to account, and that is right. Part of growing up is looking critically at the past, but this needs to be done with the kind of measured self-awareness we are now asking of celebrities, otherwise it’s just a clumsily destructive teenage rebellion.So Merry Christmas, Baby It’s Cold Outside – you can come back in from the cold. Other people, meanwhile, might benefit from some quiet contemplation in front of an open fire."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Man (60s) arrested in relation to Saturday morning incident and taken to Togher Garda stationStatus orange weather warning issued for one of the year\u0026rsquos busiest shopping daysThis year marks a decade since Localise first paired up with Larkin Community CollegeAs more allegations come to light, the organisation could face a fatal financial costOutline decision contains plans for common rule book for all countriesDraft plans on terminations also call for conscientious objectors to opt out in \u0027timely manner\u0027The specialist facility will accommodate up to 10 of Ireland\u0026rsquos most dangerous prisonersHSE proposal would see reduced facilities despite a record \u0026euro17bn in health fundingPresidential candidate responds to document revealing details of Higgins\u0026rsquos allowanceFBI says US-Irish citizen is wanted to face trial over sexual exploitation and transportation of a minorPrimates emphasise that having a home gives humans a sense of \u0026lsquopersonal dignity\u0026rsquoAbsence of consistency leading tenants to believe system subject to \u0026lsquopolitical patronage\u0026rsquoCourt hears man said \u0026lsquoI didn\u0026rsquot do it\u0026rsquo after he was charged with assault causing harmThe 22-acre site at Haulbowline Island will open to the public next MayJudge imposes further 10-year sentence, with final six years suspendedSpending increase necessary to deliver state-of-the-art facility, Minister saysFemale TDs endure sexist remarks, comments on their dress and macho cultureExpert witness agrees there was evidence of heavy braking for 10m to 13m before collision"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

It is to his credit that he managed to put a brave face on things when he addressed the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon and then somehow found the strength to follow this up with a media briefing on the plinth.One can only image the maelstrom of emotions swirling around Micheál’s head as he contemplated the devastating letter he received the night before from Marc MacSharry, Fianna Fáil’s bumptious baritone of the backbenches.Having launched his missive, MacSharry circulated it to a number of colleagues.We cannot reproduce all of it, because it’s Christmas and the newspaper can’t bear another supplement.Micheál blood will have run cold when he read the ominous opening paragraph of the 780-word communication.Marc goes on to say that continuing with the confidence-and-supply arrangement will make the party irrelevant. “An extension of even a day is an endorsement of the last 3 years with all its flaws and scandals. We cannot propose any real policy different to FG for fear of precipitating a crisis and or election, we shuffle between 4 and 8 behind them in opinion polls depending exclusively on the sum of the efforts in ground hurling by our TDs candidates, senators and Cllr’s to stay in the game but the common perception now is there is no tangible difference between us. We have morphed into FG in the public conscience.”Had the party gone for “national government rather than coalition” in 2016, he believed Micheál would be Taoiseach now.“Granted my Effrontery in going solo at the time is one of the probable many reasons for my exclusion since but look that ship has sailed. I was right though. The Brexit cover story is a red herring.”The Sligo TD points out that elections have continued throughout Europe despite Brexit and he feels an extension of article 50 beyond March “is certainly likely”. Meanwhile, the country is close to full employment and the housing and health crises need to be addressed.“The point here is we risk more permanent damage to the party by staying in,” he tells Micheál. “Staying in buys time but for what ?? More time to become even less relevant?? How and when do we get our policy out there. How do beat them up on policy ??”And when will the leadership seek more input and share information with the rest of the party?“We need unity of course but as I said before Unity flows from shared ownership. You have worked harder than any leader ever and you deserve to be Taoiseach more than any of them. Please do not renew this .Thanks for reading. Marc.”He’ll not last the year, at this rate. And he’s not the only one.Can a heave, or a split, be far off?A sweet little story this week from Leinster House as the Dáil prepares to rise for the Christmas break.It concerns American student Maeve Price, one of a group of overseas interns who have just completed a semester working with Irish parliamentarians. The programme is organised by the Institute of Public Administration.Maeve, who is studying education and communication at Denison University in Ohio, was assigned to the office of the Fianna Fáil TD for Meath East, Thomas Byrne.She told him about her parents, John and Patricia, who eloped to Sligo in 1993 and were married in Rosses Point. It wasn’t a total surprise to their folks in New Jersey, because the young couple became engaged in August of that year before they decided to make a break for Ireland and tie the knot in Yeats country.They had ties to the west of Ireland – their great-grandparents came from Galway and Mayo – and John was a great admirer of WB’s poetry.And so, with help from a priest back home, who contacted Msgr Jennings and Sr Joseph in Rosses Point, a wedding was organised. Locals pitched in with help when they heard the story and two teenagers, brother and sister Frank and Carina Mitchell, were drafted in as best man and maid of honour.Fast forward a quarter of a century, and Maeve is on a call to her mom back home in Jersey. She mentions that Thomas Byrne is a solicitor who also qualified for the New York bar. This was a co-incidence as her brother Jack is currently studying for the New York bar.“Then mom remembered that Frank told her he was going to study law. She said to me: “Just ask Thomas if he knows Frank,” Maeve recalls, adding that Ireland may be a small place, but not that small.“It was so random that my mom thought to even ask Thomas. So I brought up the name and then I showed him the picture.”Thomas Byrne says he looked at the photograph and thought: “My God, I know him.” They had studied law together in Trinity College. “I called him up in the Law Library and he remembered straight away.”Maeve completed her stint in Leinster House this week and on Thursday night she and her brother Jack had dinner in Dublin with barrister (and best man) Frank Mitchell BL.Veteran Fianna Fáil senator, Terry Leyden, caused consternation among female senators on Thursday evening during the final hours of debate before the abortion Bill was passed into law.Leyden, in a confusing contribution which had senators – along with the Minister for Health – exhorting him to actually read the section of the legislation he was pronouncing upon, said he was proud to have supported the Eighth Amendment 35 years ago. “And people seem to forget this point: this was voted by 140 Members of Dáil Éireann and it was put into the Constitution”.He then began reading the amendment. “The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and with due regard...”As a chorus of female voices told him his point wasn’t relevant and he was loudly reminded that 1.4 million people voted in May to remove the same amendment, Lynn Ruane shouted at Leyden: “Gone! Repealed! It doesn’t exist.”He turned, looked in her direction and countered “Don’t get so emotional.”Then Terry took grave umbrage at charges that his comment was misogynistic. “I’m not referring to any sex . . . I see more emotion here with David Norris than I do for any of you,” he told the women, withdrawing his remark if it had offended anyone.There then followed a most curious exchange of words.Senator Leyden appeals to the chair, claiming he is being shouted down. “In fairness now, you have to admit that they’re really coming on top of me here at the moment now, big time. In fairness now.”“We’ll get the violins out,” shrugs Lynn Ruane.“Don’t get emotional, Terry,” smiles Ivana Bacik.“There is nobody coming on top of you, I can guarantee you that,” declares Marie-Louise O’Donnell, with an even bigger smile.David Norris isn’t going to be left out. “I’d need to be more emotional than I am to get on top of you.”Brian O’Domhnaill, sitting behind Terry, is grinning away as the sound of chortling senators fills the chamber.Terry looks to the chair again. “Sorry, cathaorleach, you’ll have to, kind of, delete some of these comments which I think are very unsuitable, actually.”We are making no comment on the above. Just leaving it out there.And to think, we almost abolished the Upper House.It was a female first for Irish politics in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin on Wednesday evening when four distinguished politicians spoke from the same platform for the first time in their long careers. They also recorded another first when they sat together for a photograph.Frances Fitzgerald, Joan Burton, Mary Harney and Mary Coughlan joined historian and broadcaster David McCullagh to talk politics and their careers at an event to mark the centenary of womens’ suffrage.“The Four Tánaistí” went down a storm with the audience.Perhaps they should consider going on tour.So here we are, sitting comfortably at home in Ireland and watching the carry-on in Paris with the gilets jaunes and the anti-Macron protests.Members of the Kildare Street and University Club on St Stephen’s Green – quite a few senior civil servants among them – were aghast at a certain piece of news emailed to them during the week.Under an atmospheric blue-skies photo of a field in France, near a distant chateau, with two bottles of wine and a large glass of claret resting on the fertile soil beside a bunch of grapes, was this alarming “Club Notice”: “Members please note that due to the riots currently in France, the Club is finding it difficult to maintain levels of our French wines at present.”They must be bathing in the stuff.Another notice also caught our eye this week. Or, more precisely, the eye of our man in Brussels, Paddy Smyth.At lunchtime on Wednesday, as Downing Street’s damage limitation machine went into overdrive and Westminster went into meltdown over that evening’s vote of confidence in Theresa May, an email landed.Subject? “Merry Christmas from No 10”.And inside, a nicely lit night-time photograph of that famous front door, with the Christmas tree twinkling and a festive wreath handing from the letterbox with the message: “Best wishes for Christmas and New Year.”Life goes on, no matter who is PM or who resides in number 10."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3732026.1544853851!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what if anything would satisfy the dup in brexit negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP leader Arlene Foster attends the launch of A Better Deal in London, Britain. Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersThe Huffington Post reported on Thursday that Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party was in talks with the DUP “at a senior level” to try to find “common ground” on the way forward.That was viewed as shorthand for the DUP possibly being prepared to support a no-confidence motion that Corbyn may be scheming against May and her government in order to force a British general election – an election that could usher in a British Labour government Such a scenario would seem to border on the incredible given that Corbyn’s friendship with Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin and his support for a united Ireland are well known.The DUP said its MPs were “talking to people on all sides of the House” of Commons but that its current focus was on urging the British prime minister to convince the European Union to change the terms of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement to get rid of the backstop in its current form.The DUP, the party added, “would not support a no-confidence motion” in the British government when Theresa May is involved in lobbying the EU to alter the withdrawal agreement.But equally the DUP is not ruling anything out. Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds and Sammy Wilson are playing a very tough tactical game at the moment to force the abandonment or emasculation of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement designed to ensure a soft North-South border post Brexit. One senior party source reflected that hard-ball negotiating attitude when it was put to him that surely the DUP would never do anything that would see Jeremy Corbyn in charge of deciding the future of the “precious union”.The source told The , “In circumstances where the Tory leader was prepared to undermine the union by trying to force through an unacceptable withdrawal agreement then it would be better to deal with the person who would stab you in the front than the person who would stab you in the back.”The same source was equally confident that in any general election it would at least hold its 10 seats, again notwithstanding the support for the withdrawal agreement from the business, farming and voluntary sectors of Northern Ireland.But when the Ulster Farmers’ Union (UFU), normally so sympathetic to the DUP, comes out in favour of the withdrawal agreement surely the party should have concerns?The source wasn’t impressed with this argument. He said at the winter fair in Lisburn on Thursday a steady stream of farmers made it known to DUP MEP Diana Dodds at the party stand that it opposed what the leadership of the UFU was saying.He was conscious too of a widespread contention that the DUP just “don’t get” how serious are the stakes here. But he felt that those same people “don’t get” how unionists react when there is a perceived threat to the union. And the backstop requiring a border down the Irish Sea was a threat, he was 100 per cent certain, again notwithstanding Irish, British and EU commitments to the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement where change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland only could be effected through a majority vote of the people of the North.He asserted, “If Theresa May tries to railroad through a withdrawal agreement against our will then we would have to review the confidence-and-supply agreement, and she can’t get the agreement through without our votes.”That was putting it up to Theresa May to extract a new deal from Brussels, regardless of the fact that the word so far from the EU is that while there can be assurances that it is unlikely the backstop ever will be used, there can be no legal changes to the agreement.The DUP wants more, however, and, it was clear from this source, it was prepared to exert the gravest of threats to try to achieve that objective. One idea, he said, that could be tried would be the removal of the backstop and a legally binding addition to the withdrawal agreement stating that under no circumstances would there be a hard border between the North and South.The same source was conscious that many people in Dublin, Belfast, Brussels and London believed that the DUP was shooting itself so many times in the foot that it was running out of foot, and that ultimately rather than safeguarding the union, it was undermining that which it asserts to love and cherish.He was aware too of the ridicule and lampooning of the likes of Foster and Dodds on social and other media. “We don’t worry, Arlene and Nigel are thick-skinned, and anyway we are getting our message across to MPs in the House of Commons.”And while the source did not put it like this it was implicit that he felt that people appalled, bemused or shocked by the DUP tactics failed to understand that when unionists say “not an inch” that is precisely what they mean.“This is not about us being uber unionists,” said the well-placed source seeking to promote some understanding of the DUP position. “But this is about the union, and once you start threatening the union it is a very serious thing to do. And remember every single unionist party is on the same page as us.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Most expect another summit in January.\u0026nbsp Concerned that perhaps the leaders were not being seen in the media as sufficiently sympathetic to MPs’ concerns about getting out of the backstop, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that “a second after approval by the British and European parliaments of the withdrawal agreement we will start negotiations” on the future relationship.He acknowledged “deep mistrust” in the Commons of the EU’s intentions, but the union was determined that the backstop should not last one day more than necessary. It will be suspended when agreement is in place on an alternative which does an equal job in protecting the frictionless border.He insisted that the EU treated the British prime minister with great respect – better, in fact, than many British MPs.The leaders agreed two important elements of economic and monetary union reform – the creation of a common backstop for the banking Single Resolution Fund, a means of ensuring the fund can cope with even the biggest defaults.And secondly, \u0026nbspto give the European Stability Mechanism, the union’s state bailout arm, stronger powers to prevent and manage financial crises.The move would “significantly strengthen the monetary union”, Mr Juncker said, adding that the leaders had also indicated their support for recently announced Commission plans to bolster the international standing and use of the euro.The leaders agreed to ask the European Commission to continue its work on a stabilisation and competitiveness fund that would help sates weather internal and external economic shocks. They agreed that funding for the measures would come from the EU’s next seven-year budget, the MFF.Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists that the “Franco-German proposal for a euro zone budget has been controversial so far and therefore we were asked to explain it again before the council. We have adopted substantial parts of what Macron has proposed, the French president was quite satisfied, we made good contribution with the Franco-German co-operation.”\u0026nbsp Mr Juncker said that the leaders’ debate on the MFF, which saw little more than a formal restatement of member-state starting positions, and the work done by the Austrian presidency in crafting the complex “negotiating box” setting out options, would allow the incoming Romanian presidency to accelerate discussions.He expressed disappointment that the leaders had been unable to advance the asylummigration reform package debate, accusing some member states of “hypocrisy” over their lukewarm support for commission proposals to strengthen the EU coastal and border service.\u0026nbspFive elements of a seven-element migration package were close to agreement, but supporters of reform of the “Dublin” regulation to increase support for front-line states by sharing resettlements refuse to split the package. They fear that to do so will see Dublin reform consigned to an indefinite future.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Geert VandenAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that there are “limitations” to any assistance to what the EU can offer the British Prime Minister Theresa May to help her get the withdrawal treaty passed.Mr Varadkar said that he and other EU leaders wanted to be as helpful as possible to Mrs May in her attempts to get the withdrawal treaty through Westminster, “but there are limitations to that”.“We can’t get into a situation where we’re contradicting anything that is in the legal text of the treaty that’s been agreed,” he told a press conference after the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels today.Mr Varadkar said there was no agreement on what clarifications or declarations or assurances that Mrs May might want, echoing a frustration with the British prime minister evident among other EU leaders over the two-day meeting which was, once again, dominated by Brexit. Mr Varadkar stressed the EU’s wish to help Mrs May, but added: “That is contingent on her understanding that there are limitations.” Earlier, Mrs May acknowledged it will not be possible to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to alter the backstop provisions which have sparked mass rebellion among Conservative MPs. She said Britain would have have talks with the EU over the coming days about how to obtain “further assurances” which might persuade MPs to back the deal.In a press conference at the end of the European Council summit in Brussels, Mrs May said she had a “robust” discussion with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.She insisted she had been “crystal clear” about the UK’s need for firmer assurances that the backstop cannot become permanent. Video footage of the conversation showed a clearly angry Mrs May apparently berating Mr Juncker for saying that her address to leaders of the 27 remaining states on Thursday evening had been “nebulous”. Mrs May welcomed the official conclusions issued by the EU27 which committed the EU to trying to get a post-Brexit trade deal agreed quickly enough to avoid the need for a backstop to keep the Irish border open.“The EU is clear, as I am, that if we are going to leave with a deal, this is it,” she said.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU27 were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over 18 months.Meanwhile, British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is dead in the water. “The Prime Minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal. Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the Prime Minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control,” Mr Corbyn said. - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The latest negotiations illustrate again, observers say, the political naivety that has characterised British Brexit diplomacy. Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergImagine if the summit had agreed to Theresa May’s request. If the leaders had signed up to a legal declaration on the backstop that made clear it was temporary, even time-limited.The British prime minister would have returned to the Commons waving a piece of paper declaring peace in our time, a deal done, sufficient reassurance . . . and MPs would have said thank you, we’ll bank that, but it’s not enough. And sent Mrs May back to get more.These are seasoned politicians, heads of government, well used to the cut and thrust of difficult negotiation, who understand parliamentary manoeuvres. That she thought they would sign up to anything without a copperfastened guarantee that her MPs would wear it, illustrates again, observers say, the political naivety that has characterised British Brexit diplomacy.“In both countries someone took responsibility to decide what do we do. In both Denmark and Ireland somebody took it upon themselves to say what can unite us in our country and what should we ask from Europe.”In the wake of a 2016 Dutch referendum defeat for an EU treaty on relations with Ukraine, prime minister Mark Rutte came to fellow leaders with proposals for a “clarification” of the treaty, but with a clear assurance that his parliament would endorse the treaty if they agreed to the clarification.The EU leaders accommodated him, as did his parliament.Mrs May can offer no such assurances. And EU leaders, who read newspapers, are only too well of that reality. They will not buy a pig in a poke.The deletion of a reference in the draft conclusions to a suggestion that leaders were “ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided” was agreed without any opposition, diplomats say. But president of the European Council Donald Tusk was saying on Friday night that although he has “no mandate to reopen any new negotiations”, and that the withdrawal agreement could not be touched, “I am always at Mrs May’s disposal.”The expectation now is that she will try both to make her request for clarification more specific and, with no doubt some difficulty, provide in return some assurances to the EU that this will fly with the Commons. It is also expected that she will come back to another special summit in January. And may well fail again.Ireland, though Irish diplomats were careful not to claim credit for it, was also successful in removing a reference to a “short” duration for the life of the backstop – any time limit is anathema. And for adding an explicit requirement that any replacement would have to “ensure that a hard border is avoided”, an understood but unstated qualification.\u0026nbspAlthough Mrs May left with a confident insistence that she was in a better place to get the deal past, leaders’ prognoses were somewhat grimmer, and perhaps more realistic. There was much talk of stepping up no-deal planning.Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, on his way out,\u0026nbspechoed the common view that a no-deal scenario was now “a realistic prospect”. “Very objectively,” he said, “the signs that we were given yesterday were not especially reassuring as to the ability of the parliament to be able to honour the commitment that was given.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesBritish foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Saturday that the British parliament could back prime minister Theresa May’s deal if lawmakers received assurances from the European Union, but warned that a no deal Brexit was still on the table.Mrs May pulled a vote on her deal this week after acknowledging it would be heavily defeated over concerns about the orce agreement’s “backstop”, an insurance policy designed to avoid any hard land border for Ireland but which critics say could bind Britain to EU rules indefinitely.“When the dust has settled, the only way we’re going to get this through the House of Commons ... is to have a version of the deal that the government has negotiated,” Mr Hunt told BBC radio.Following a summit in Brussels on Friday, Mrs May said it was possible that the EU could give further guarantees that the backstop would be temporary although the bloc’s other 27 leaders told her they would not renegotiate the treaty.Mr Hunt said the EU was likely to make concessions to avoid Britain leaving without any deal, a scenario that both sides say would be highly damaging for business and their economies.“The EU cannot be sure that if they choose not to be helpful and flexible ... that we would not end up with no deal,” Mr Hunt said. “We cannot in these negotiations take no deal off the table. I don’t think the EU could be remotely sure that if we don’t find a way through this we wouldn’t end up with no deal.”The Times newspaper reported on Saturday that most of Mrs May’s senior ministerial team thought her deal was dead and were discussing a range of options including a second referendum.“Brexit is in danger of getting stuck - and that is something that should worry us all,” pensions minister Amber Rudd wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper.“If MPs (lawmakers) dig in against the Prime Minister’s deal and then hunker down in their different corners, none with a majority, the country will face serious trouble.”–Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

She said the official conclusions of a meeting of the other 27 leaders, which had been amended to remove a promise of further reassurances on the Northern Ireland backstop, represented progress.\u0026nbsp“Those take us forward. Those are welcome. This is the clearest statement we have had yet from the European Union that it is their intention for the backstop never to be necessary, that it is their intention to ensure that if it were necessary it was only temporary and that it’s their intention to work quickly with us once we’ve seen the deal being agreed in parliamentary terms, that they will work quickly with us to ensure that we start those negotiations about a future partnership,” she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister postponed a vote in parliament on the Brexit deal this week after it became clear it would be defeated heavily. But she said she was confident she could win further reassurances from the EU on the backstop before bringing the vote back to parliament next month.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMrs May was seen admonishing Mr Juncker before the start of Friday’s session at the summit, after he had described her presentation to the leaders the previous evening as “nebulous”. She said afterwards that she had been “crystal clear” in her presentation and that Mr Juncker had explained his remark.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGerman chancellor Angela Merkel said\u0026nbspit was essential that there would be no renegotiating or amendment of the withdrawal agreement, the single market is guaranteed and the Belfast Agreement is preserved.She said the statement in the official conclusions about the backstop were what the EU 27 had to offer in terms of reassurance but she did not rule out making further clarifications.\u0026nbsp“These are the assurances we have given to the British prime minister. Now we await her response,” she said.\u0026nbsp”We want to be helpful, but within the framework I have been describing. We don’t want to amend the withdrawal agreement and we will have to continue to work on the future relationship anyway.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Staff were said to be astonished when Lineker was allowed to appear on stage at a rally last month calling for a second referendum.“Never mind the small print on the editorial guidelines - they state that whatever we say or write can have an influence. Gary is extremely influential, with seven million Twitter followers. He’s running a political campaign and it’s not right,” said one presenter.Another said: “The rest of us couldn’t possibly go and tweet about Brexit without being hauled over the coals. But there’s this feeling that it’s Gary, and therefore he can do it.”Earlier this year, members of the BBC Women group were prevented from discussing equal pay on air because they had publicly expressed solidarity with Carrie Gracie, the former China editor who was found to be paid less than male colleagues.They included Jane Garvey, presenter of Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, who tweeted yesterday: “As I understand it, Gary does sport so he can talk politics. I talk about women and I can’t talk about politics but I can talk about #women and even #EqualPay as long as I don’t talk on the BBC about #EqualPay (or the lack of it) at the BBC. Couldn’t be clearer.”BBC insiders said that Lineker’s status as a freelancer meant the corporation has little control over what he says on his personal Twitter account.The issue came to the fore after Jonathan Agnew, the cricket correspondent and Test Match Special veteran, wrote online: “Gary. You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your politial views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I’d be sacked if I followed your example.”After the BBC published a lengthy piece yesterday explaining why Lineker was not breaching guidelines, the presenter tweeted: “Oh dear, looks like I don’t need to stick to football. My deepest apologies in advance.”Please review our commenting policyObamacare ruled unconstitutional by US federal judgeBritish sailor Susie Goodall back on dry land after boat capsized in Pacific Ocean UK weather: Storm Deidre to bring freezing rain and black ice this weekend, Met Office warns Comment: Theresa May is rightly ridiculed over Brexit, but she’s not the only leader to be having problemsHarvey Weinstein bragged about sleeping with Jennifer Lawrence, lawsuit claimsSunday  writers look back at milestones for the paper from 1961 to present day Paris braces itself for fifth weekend of \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protestsHow the first editor of The Sunday  once risked death at the hands of Churchill\u0026#39s sonComment: \u0026#39President of the rich\u0026#39 Macron shows that he\u0026#39s a man with a gilt complex Comment: British politics is now so farcical, it’s like watching The ApprenticeComment: Hardline Remainers might just be the Brexiteers\u0026#39 new best friends – they\u0026#39re the route to a no-deal BrexitChristmas Agatha Christie will reflect parallels between fascism and Brexit Britain, show\u0026#39s writer saysAustralia recognises west Jerusalem as Israel’s capitalWoman who \u0026#39went to extreme lengths\u0026#39 in fake cancer fraud jailedAt least 10 die after eating at Indian temple ceremonyDonald Trump names Mick Mulvaney as next chief of staffLondon Underground bans dating app ad featuring topless man, 58, for \u0026#39 sexual objectification\u0026#39Comment: Brexiteers chasing a will-o’-the-wisp perfect deal need to re-evaluateComment: My view as a psychologist: Theresa May has shown resilience, but has too strong a sense that she is rightDeadly rose virus which could wipe out British flowers is likely to come to UK, RHS says as it backs project to sequence DNA We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/15/TELEMMGLPICT000183727089_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNadeZm0KzkFwpSYJhHDpPbQMI5hkDcUBB5qZKQzbZSY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"australia recognises west jerusalem israels capital","story":"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announces that Australia will recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of IsraelAustralia has decided to formally recognise west Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but won’t move its embassy until there’s a peace settlement between Israel and Palestinians, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Saturday.He said in a speech that Australia will recognise east Jerusalem as Palestine’s capital only after a settlement has been reached on a two-state solution. The Australian Embassy won’t be moved from Tel Aviv until such a time, he said.While the embassy move is delayed, Mr Morrison said his government will establish a defense and trade office in Jerusalem and will also start looking for an appropriate site for the embassy.The Australian government has decided that Australia now recognizes west Jerusalem, as the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel, Mr Morrison said. He said the decision respects both a commitment to a two-state solution and longstanding respect for relevant UN Security Council resolutions.Mr Morrison had earlier floated the idea that Australia may follow the contentious US move of relocating its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, but it was seen by many Australians as a political stunt. Critics called it a cynical attempt to win votes in a by-election in October for a Sydney seat with a high Jewish population.The consideration had sparked backlash from Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia, threatening a free trade deal which has now been delayed.Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Saturday that the decision to recognize west Jerusalem as Israel’s capital but not move the embassy there was a humiliating backdown from the October by-election campaign.What I’m worried is that Mr. Morrison put his political interest ahead of our national interest, Shorten told

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That Mike Ashley. Has the FT taken leave of its senses? The same title that exposed the scandal of the macho bad behaviour surrounding the Presidents Club dinner now praising the business boss who vomited into a fireplace after consuming 12 pints in a pub during a management meeting?Actually, the FT is right. The source of the applause was the memo Ashley sent to the Debenhams board, expressing anger at their refusal of a £40m interest-free loan and equity injection from his Sports Direct chain, the department store group’s biggest shareholder. In no uncertain terms, Ashley maps out the lie of the land for the Debenhams directors. It’s not pretty: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory the market is saying Debenhams has no credit insurance advisers and banks are telling suppliers they should not trade with the firm at a level above which they can afford to lose suppliers are managing themselves out of stores product is being discounted to try and realise some cash.” And, says Ashley, with a final flourish: “Additionally, it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Sports Direct boss issues warning to Debenhams in leaked letterCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisPhew. That’s telling them. And that’s the point. Because too few senior business people tell it how it is, for fear of provoking upset and spoiling relationships. Too many of their advisers seek to please, not help. The result is that they carry on existing in a bubble. Decisions that should be taken aren’t, boards do not confront reality, and instead, carry on their sweet way. Opportunities to act, to do something, are lost, with the result that when the C-suite does decide to move it’s often too late. For injecting a dose of reality into proceedings, and, hopefully, making the Debenhams top brass sit up and see sense, Ashley deserves much credit. At the very least, they cannot maintain they were not made aware. His straight-talking is commendable and authoritative – Ashley, don’t forget, is immersed in retail, and is grappling on a daily basis with the same landscape that is confronting Debenhams.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursuedIt’s Ashley as well, as the head of an empire that along with Sports Direct includes lingerie firm Agent Provocateur, Evans Cycles, luxury fashion chain Flannels, the House of Fraser department stores, and major holdings in Debenhams and French Connection, who is warning loudly about the dire future facing the high street. Rising rents and growing popularity of online shopping paint a bleak prospect, one that he says could be improved by a tax on firms who generate 20 per cent of their revenues from the internet.As with Debenhams, Ashley does not pull his punches, telling MPs, the high street is heading for extinction\u0026nbspunless radical action was taken and warning them: “I’m not Father Christmas.”I never imagined I’d write this: we need more Mike Ashleys. Not the bad boy Ashley, but the one who is prepared to speak out, to stand up and to be counted.What’s striking is just how few major retailers are prepared to voice their fears and frustrations. We’re entering a season of renewed woe in the industry, of yet more dismal sets of results and closures – but the silence, the sense of inertia, will be resounding.In private, they’re all complaining and moaning like mad. But, hidebound by conservatism, afraid of rocking the boat, of drawing attention to themselves and somehow being seen as in trouble, they’re saying very little in public.The result is that it’s not just the directors of Debenhams who are able to kid themselves, but trade associations, industry organisations, MPs, media, councils, landlords, trade unions. They, along with the retailers, should all be campaigning to save our high streets, highlighting the imbalance between digital and bricks and mortar, pointing up the ridiculous nature of the business rates system, stating categorically that thousands of jobs are going to perish – not to mention the knock-on effects to communities.There’s a bit of noise, but it’s scattergun, and nowhere near concerted or loud enough. The fact it’s fallen to Ashley to say something, speaks volumes.All credit to him, though. Of course he’s got a vested interest, as he has in Debenhams. But if he does not protest, who will? Hopefully, the directors of Debenhams will wake up, along with the MPs he was addressing.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursued. The time for retreating into the bunker, and hoping the danger will pass, has gone. The Debenhams board must act, and act now. Likewise, where the broader state of the high street is concerned, we need action and we need it now. Mike Ashley, a saviour. Who would have thought it?

HoF knocked nearly £32m off the top.\u0026nbspThe, um, ‘Harrods of the High Street’, as Ashley has sought to brand his new toy, is proving every bit as pricey as the famous Knightsbridge department store to its new owner.Other Ashley bets, notably Debenhams, caused more pain in the form write downs totalling nearly £77m. He also has substantial stakes in Findel, French Connection, Game Digital, Goals Soccer Centres and the Iconix Brand Group. And he\u0026nbspbought Evans Cycles from its administrators too.\u0026nbspAll this at a time when the core Sports Direct business has held up remarkably well. Yes UK sales fell a little bit (0.2 per cent), but given the current retail climate that counts as a pretty good result.\u0026nbspIt often seems as if Ashley enjoys the practice of putting a pistol to his feet and emptying the clip into them. Yet there is a counter argument.Despite the money lavished on top business executives, they’re as inclined to groupthink as anyone else.\u0026nbspThe current consensus holds that department stores are doomed, the high street needs radical surgery, and there will be more retailers beating a path to administrators\u0027 doors\u0026nbspover the\u0026nbspcoming year. Ashley has repeatedly pushed back against that. HoF would be gone were it not for him. So would Evans, and others.\u0026nbspHe’s not above loudly calling\u0026nbspfor help (see his recent sparring\u0026nbspwith MPs). But he probably knows he’s not going to get it.\u0026nbspYet he’s still ploughing on at a time when no one else seems to want\u0026nbspto.\u0026nbspIt’s incredibly difficult to see him pulling it off.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale.

PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

There would never be a Drake without a Kanye, West wrote.Origins of the beef between West and the Canadian rapper appear to have emerged a decade ago, when the two started sharing managers – setting them on the path of in-person meetings, mutual praise across blog posts and interviews, and, eventually, their drawn-out fall-out.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHere is how history remembers the Kanye West vs Drake beef so far:Kanye West reignites, then appears to squash, beef with Drake2008, as\u0026nbspComplex\u0026nbspnotes, was the year Drake secured Cortez Bryant as his manager.Who is Bryant\u0027s business partner, you ask? None other than Gee Roberson, who counted West among his clients at the time.This appears to be the moment West and Drake\u0027s paths started to cross – the inciting incident, perhaps, of the soap opera of their lives.It might be hard to believe today, but there was once a time when Drake and West heaped praise on each other publicly.That was the year West said Drake had one of the best lines of the year on his song\u0026nbspEvery Girl.Drake, meanwhile, called West the most influential musician in his life in an interview with\u0026nbspMTV.2009 was also the year West and Drake met in Hawaii, and the year they were both featured on a remix of Jamie Foxx\u0027s\u0026nbspDigital Girl.2010: Trouble in paradiseFind Your Love,\u0026nbspa Drake song co-written and co-produced by West, was released in May 2010. A good sign, surely?Well, not exactly – West said in 2013 that he was fine working on the track until Drake got too big.In September of that year, Drake was spotted with Amber Rose – then West\u0027s recent ex, which many believe contributed to their discord.2011 will go down in beef history as the year Drake told\u0026nbspThe Source\u0026nbspabout West:\u0026nbsp“My goal is to surpass everything he’s accomplished. I don’t want to be as good as Kanye, I want to be better.”In December of that year, Drizzy appeared to confirm he was coming for West\u0027s crown\u0026nbspby rapping on DJ Khaled\u0027s\u0026nbspI\u0027m On One: I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking  Watch me take it.2013: Drake acknowledges the elephant in the roomMe and Ye just fell into this thing where we hadn’t actually talked to each other in so long that all this stuff got built up, Drake told\u0026nbspBillboard\u0026nbspthat year.Sometimes you just have to find the opportunity to tell someone that you really like and respect them. After that, everything can move forward.Rolling Stone\u0026nbspreaders gasped when Drake was quoted as dissing\u0026nbspWest\u0027s album\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin these terms: There were some real questionable bars on thereLike that ‘Swaghili’ line? Come on, man. Even Fabolous wouldn’t say some s*** like that.Drake promptly said on Twitter he never commented on\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin the interview.West was later quoted as supporting Drake during his tours, saying magazines were trying to pit n***** against each other.\u0026nbspBig Sean\u0027s\u0026nbspBlessings, on which West and Drake both feature, came out in January 2015, inaugurating what is remembered as one of the more positive years of the West  Drake timeline.In February 2015, West teased the possibility of doing an album with Drake in the future.That same month, Drake brought West onstage during one of his shows.Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

In it, he responds to Pusha T, with whom Drake is involved in a separate feud.\u0026nbspPusha T had accused Drake of resorting to ghostwriters. In turn, Drake implied in the lyrics of\u0026nbspDuppy Freestyle\u0026nbsphe had ghostwritten for West, the founder of Pusha\u0026nbspT\u0027s label GOOD Music.Things escalated until September, when Drake appeared to diss\u0026nbspWest\u0027s Yeezy 350 sneakers in a collaboration with French Montana, writing: Keeping it G, I told her don’t wear no 350s around me.Instead of fighting back, West addressed Drake in a series of tweets apologising for various things, writing at one point: There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you.All of this brings us to December 2018 and West\u0027s most recent tweetstorm, which appeared to have been triggered by a clearance request from Drake regarding his own song\u0026nbspSay What\u0027s Real, which features a sample by West.West tweeted a screenshot of a request before firing off many tweets about Drake, at one point claiming Drake had threatened him during a phone call.His wife Kim Kardashian chimed in, writing:\u0026nbsp@drake Never threaten my husband or our family. He paved the way for their to be a Drake.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.I personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

They had hoped to land somewhere plain, but found it even more free of rocks and safe than they had been expecting.The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it\u0027ll be extremely safe for our instruments, said InSight\u0027s Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Anyone who’s anyone will be there: the former contestants will dance again (with the possible exception of stroppy Danny John Jules), Michael Buble will sing and who knows who they’ll drag off the street to read the terms and conditions. I’m guessing either Danny Dyer or Alexander the Meerkat from the car insurance ads.But really it’s all about the four finalists. They’ll each be performing three times: reprising their favourite dance from the series, repeating a routine the judges would like to see again (usually one that had room for improvement) and introducing their dazzling showdances.To the uninitiated, the showdances are the only routines in the show that don’t have any rules: they can include any style of dance, as many lifts as you like and are tailored to the celebrity’s strengths. The final has been won and lost on these bad boys – Tom Chambers and Ore Oduba were shock winners after magical showdances and Colin Jackson had the glitterball snatched away from him after a weird routine involving life-size puppets.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

It’s possible enough will be – but they might not.“We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus.That requires politicians to be more prepared to work with anyone who – like me – is willing to accept you can’t always get what you want.

Instead, she promised to secure further assurances from the EU on the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop, which Brexiteers fear could trap the UK in a customs union permanently.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0027s\u0026nbsppleas were rebuffed by Brussels on Thursday, however, with EU leaders united in their insistence that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened.Ms May\u0026nbspis likely to face fresh\u0026nbspanger from MPs\u0026nbspon Monday when she will have to admit to the Commons that she has failed to secure any new guarantees on the backstop.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The bloc has ruled this out, said it would effectively render\u0026nbspthe backstop ineffective,\u0026nbspand that it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement.That backstop policy ties the UK to the EU’s customs area and ramps up checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in order to prevent a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.“As I have always said, the guaranteed way of avoiding the backstop is to have the future partnership in place by the time the implementation period is over. The EU is very firmly committed to this course,” Ms May said.British tourists will pay €7 to visit Europe post-Brexit, EU revealsEU holds back plan to rescue Theresa May’s Brexit deal until new yearCrunch vote on May’s deal Brexit definitely not before ChristmasLeo Varadkar warns Theresa May not to renege on backstop vow“There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK\u0026nbspparliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.”Mr Tusk and his European Commission counterpart Jean-Claude Juncker sought to downplay accusations that the prime minister\u0026nbsphad been treated poorly by the EU.“We have treated Prime Minister May with the greatest respect, all of us, and we really appreciate the effort by the prime minister to ratify our common agreement,” Mr Tusk said.\u0026nbsp“My impression is that in fact we have treated Prime Minister May\u0026nbspwith a much greater empathy and respect than some British MPs, for sure.”Juncker had an icy conversation on Friday morningMr Juncker\u0026nbspdismissed silent footage of an argument between him and Ms May on Friday morning. The prime minister appeared to confront him after taking offence over\u0026nbsphis\u0026nbspuse of the term “nebulous” to describe\u0026nbspthe debate in the UK. But he said the two leaders had worked it out, and that “in the course of the morning after having checked what I said yesterday night she was kissing me”.Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is chairing the European Council, added: “Not all rumours in the media really go in line with how the meeting was. The problem is just that we had two different positions.”Accounts of last night’s meeting suggest the prime minister’s speech, in which she called for help to get the agreement “over the line”, was repeatedly interrupted by Angela Merkel asking her what she actually wanted from the EU leaders.Senior UK government officials admitted that the prime minister did not bring any documented proposals with her to the meeting.\u0026nbspThe approach puzzled EU diplomats, who for days before the conference had said they needed to see what proposals Ms May had come up with before they could respond to her request for aid.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said at a midnight press conference after the discussion: “I do find it uncomfortable that there’s an impression perhaps in the UK that it is for the EU to propose solutions.\u0026nbsp“It is for the UK leaving the EU and I would have thought that it was rather more for the British government.”In the margins of the summit the meeting is already being called “Salzburg 2.0” – a reference to a previous summit in September where the prime minister’s dinner speech also ended up accidentally hardening the EU position.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The largest diamond ever found in North America has been unearthed in Canada.\u0026nbspThe 552-carat yellow diamond was found at Diavik Diamond Mine, northeast of Yellowknife in October and measures about the size of a chicken-egg.“This incredible discovery showcases what is truly spectacular about Canadamark diamonds,” said Kyle Washington, Chairman of Dominion Diamond Mines.“The colour and texture of the diamond are a unique example of the journey that natural diamonds take from their formation until we unearth them.

time, heres what we know about the possibility of a second referendum - and how another Brexit vote would work.On December , Mrs Mays spokesman again made clear there will be no second referendum while she is PM.Mays position looks all the stronger for having seen off a vote of no confidence from her own party on December , coming away with a majority of  as preferred leader.This leadership challenge came after she cancelled the crunch Brexit vote in the Commons on December  as it was widely thought she would lose.Mays Cabinet allies have been asking MPsthey could back a second referendum.The Prime Ministers deputy David Lidington, and Justice Secretary David Gauke, have been in talks with Labour politicians to seethere was support for a second vote - or a Norway-style deal.Allies told the Sunday Times that most MPs are likely to get behind a second Brexit referendum, further iding Britain.Civil servants have reportedly been drawing up possible scenarios - including Leave and Remain, or a second option on whether to back Mays deal or leave on World Trade Organisation terms.But Mrs May is having ever less room to negotiate as she tries to broker a deal that is more palatable to her colleagues.That vote could now be delayed until January,it happens at all.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood has hinted he could support another referendum.He said: If parliament does not agree a Brexit deal soon, then we must recognise that the original mandate to leave, taken over two years ago, will begin to date and will, eventually, no longer represent a reflection of current intent.One Cabinet minister told The Observer that the PM was so committed to the deal that a second referendum could now be the only way of getting it.Science minister Sam Gyimah and Universities minister Jo Johnson have both quit the government in the last month and called for a second vote on Brexit.Several other ministers and whips are also said to be on the verge of walking out too.Gavin Williamsons parliamentary aide Will Quince quit on December  and Liam Foxs private secretary is also considering quitting too.Shortly after Jo Johnsons resignation, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for a second Brexit referendum accusing the UK government of “self absorption.”He told Politico: “If I was Theresa May, I would call a second referendum — no doubt.”Sanchez said that Britain leaving the European Union was “a great loss for both.”He added: “I hope it can be reconsidered in the future”.A number of EU leaders echoed their support for a second referendum at the end of September.Works and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd suggested there could be a second referendumMays Brexit plan is rejected by MPs in the Commons.While Downing Street has insisted there is no plan B, Rudd admitted anything could happen.Now that Mays leadership is being questioned, Labour have the chance to step up.The Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said they would start seeking a second referendum.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.In September , Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.Labours official position is that it would vote against any deal struck by Theresa May with the aim of pushing for a General Election.Speaking on BBCs Andrew Marr Show, Starmer said: “If there’s no deal brought back or the deal is voted down, then other options are on the table, one of which is a public vote.“And in that public vote no options are ruled out, including the option of remain.On November  former PM Tony Blair insisted Jeremy Corbyn is likely to start backing a second EU referendum in the near future.After May won her leadership battle on December , Corbyn tweeted: Tonights vote changes nothing.Theresa May has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and shes unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first.She must now bring her botched deal back to Parliament next week.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it would be inevitable another EU referendum would be calledLabour are not able to force a general election.He told the BBC forcing an election would be very dficult andthat was not possible, Labour would push for another referendum.In December, Bet was offering   that there would be another referendum by the end of , and   there would not.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed  per cent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while  per cent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview  was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.On November , , it was reported that the majority of voters in all seats held by Labour support a second referendum on Brexit.The findings were according to an analysis released by the People’s Vote campaign from a YouGov poll of , people.The Prime Minister was determined to persuade MPs to back the deal in a Parliamentary vote on December  .But when success seemed so unlikely that she pulled the vote, it is now unclear what will happen next.One potential course of events would involve the vote ing to the Commons by the end of January.If she then fails to secure the votes required then a second Brexit referendum could be on the table.The SNP have said they would back a so-called Peoples Vote and a number of Conservative MPs have also backed one.So there could be a majority in Parliament for it but a second referendum will not happen quickly and the first stage is for there to be an Act of Parliament.That will require the backing of a majority of MPs and it took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in .Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February , and the vote taking place on  June.But the Electoral Commission has said in future there should be at least a six-month gap to allow enough time to register campaigns and put counting officers in place.There is also the question of what to do about Article .Britain could vote to remain in the EU, but have already left by the time the vote was held.This could be avoidedthe EU agreed to extend the Article  deadline - but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions - for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU or leave with no deal - then just  per cent could decide the winning option.  The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in .In the summer of , Britain voted to leave the EU after .million people backed Leave compared to .million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on

In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I kept thinking ‘Ive won’ - things like this never happen to me.“The first thing I thought was – ‘I can be mortgage free. I could pay off the mortgage and give some money to my kids’.”But Angela’s dreams were shattered when she excitedly rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working.“Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadn’t scratchedoff properly.“If I had scratched off any more the card would have been wrecked.”Camelot told Angela one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E - not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up.It comes after dad-of-four Eric was also denied a £k payout on his card - after being accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.Unemployed Eric, who buys six scratchcards a day, believes there was a misprint on the scratchcard after he matched three symbols.He has now invited cops to his home to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated.Similarly, Angela believes Camelot is keeping her cash because it wants to avoid a mass pay out in case there is a widespread fault with the cards.The mum-of-two said: “When I spoke to Camelot they said this had never happened before.“I told them ‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’.“It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.”The game offers five top prizes of £, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols.Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and refuted claims of a faulty batch.A spokesperson said today: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims.We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket.If we believe that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery, then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.”Angela has refused to give up on her claim and wants others to be aware of the alleged “faulty cards in case they miss out on their own fortune.She said: At first I took Camelot’s word for it, but now I’ve seen its happened to someone .“I don’t think it’s right. My le could have been completely changed.“I feel like I’ve been cheated.  “When I scratched the card I didn’t think it was real. But you start to believe.“For Camelot to turn around and say no, it feels like they’ve ripped that dream away.“It’s a huge conglomerate against one person. What hope in hell do you have ”Both Angela and Eric now argue they should receive the £k bounty.She said: “It’s funny that now two faulty cards have come to light within a few days of each other.It can’t just be us two. But Lotto is still saying: No, the winning card hasn’t come to light yet.“I know I’ve won.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456121357.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"teething gels removed supermarkets","story":"Thats because theres a lack of evidence that teething gels relieve pain in teething babies, health experts have warned.Childrens teething products containing the drug lidocaine, including Bonjela and Anbesol, will only be available in pharmacies from  under new guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .There are very small risks associated with using the products but they should only be used when non-medical options havent provided pain relief, the health body advised.A review into the products found there was a lack of evidence theres any benefit to using the gels in place of non-medical options like teething toys.Instead a pharmacist of health care professional should provide guidance before the medicated gels are used.The products that will no longer be available in the supermarket, only in pharmacies, include:To help babies and children with teething, parents and caregivers should try non-medicine options such as rubbing or massaging the gums or a teething ring.We want to make sure you get the right information about teething.If your child continues to have problems with teething, talk to your pharmacist or healthcare professional about the best options.Ash Soni, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: It’s natural for parents to be concernedtheir baby is experiencing discomfort with sore gums when teething.Your local pharmacist can provide parents and caregivers of teething babies with expert advice and recommend the best course of treatment.Your pharmacist is always a good first port of call for any common condition your child develops.It’s advised that you give a teething baby something to chew on like a teething ring that’s been in the fridge but,that isn’t enough, then your pharmacist can give you expert advice about using a teething product containing lidocaine and how to use it safely.A spokesman for Bonjela said: Bonjela is aware that the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas stated that treatments for teething pain containing lidocaine hydrochlorideshould be available as pharmacy only and in packs of  grams or less.Bonjela Teething Gel, which contain lidocaine, have been widely used by parents to soothe the pain and discomfort their children experience when teething.As of September , Bonjela Teething Gel is no longer available as a result of a business decision to withdraw it.Bonjela Junior Gel continues to be available as a product for children over five months for the relief of pain from common mouth ulcers and denture irritation but will no longer be indicated as a treatment for teething pain in children.In line with the MHRA ruling, the packaging will be updated with the amended indication that the product can be used on children over five months for relief of pain from common mouth ulcers.

Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They sent the email saying remove them from shelves now and even sent someone from Camelot to enforce it.Im not sure whether people are doctoring them or not but its weird its the same scratchcard for all of them that had to be removed from sale as there was an issue with it.Camelot confirmed the scratchcard had been removed from a small percentage of shops because some players were told their tickets were not winners.A spokesperson said: Although some Scratchcards appeared to have won a prize, some players were advised that they had not won when attempting to claim their prizes in-store – this was down to an issue in our back-end system and only affected low-tier prizes of up to £.To be clear, no higher-tier prize payments were affected. We took immediate action to noty our retailers of the issue and stop further sales of this Scratchcard at the time.The system error was rectied shortly afterwards and, following a rigorous testing and approval process, the Scratchcard was put back on sale in early April  – so it has been on sale for more than eight months with no subsequent issues.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Simple form, like #ESTA to the US, but way cheaper.News that the ETIASpass, could be introduced from  came as:Travellers pay £ and consent to have their details checked to make sure they dont pose a security risk.The EU says: Since citizens of countries who do not need a visa for travel purposes of up to  days in the EU do not need to go through a long process of applying for the visa, the ETIAS will make sure that these people are not a security threat.The ETIAS, besides being used for business and tourist purposes, will also allow people to visit the Schengen countries for medical and transit reasons.Top Tories had previously insisted that the UK would be exempted from any new travel scheme.But the Commission is determined to introduce a US-style system for non-bloc visitors. Brits currently pay £ for an “ESTA” to enter the US.The charge would apply from the end of transition because we’ll be outside the EU and the passport-free Schengen Zone.  Campaigners said the scheme would cost UK tourists up to £million in its first year given the number who head for the sun.Trips are worth £.billion a year to Spain alone. And one in six businesses in Malta relies directly on UK tourists for their survival.Tory Rob Halfon said: “If the EU is going to behave like this we should be telling them they aren’t getting a penny of the £billion orce bill.”Downing Street warned the EU it could slap Europeans with similar charges. But it admitted there were no current plans to do so.Remainers seized on the revelations. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon branded the move a “sad, retrograde step”. And Labour’s Stephen Doughty said: “Now we are going to have to pay to travel to EU countries  Time for a People’s Vote.”A Government spokesman said: “We are considering options for the future border and immigration system in the UK, including proposals for an Electronic Travel Authorisation scheme.“The framework for the future relationship would see visa-free travel to the EU for both holidays and short-term business visits.“Both sides have leant on the need for such arrangements to be reciprocal.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added: “I was walking down the high street earlier and a bloke said ‘Tell her to kick him in the balls for me’.”Mr Juncker has been dogged for years by rumours of heavy boozing. Last year he was branded embarrassing after appearing “very visibly drunk” at a UN summit in Geneva.This latest spat came as Mrs May desperately tried to convince MPs she had made progress at the summit in persuading EU leaders to give Britain concessions on her PM deal.Tory chiefs pulled the deal from a Commons vote on Tuesday amid fears of a thumping defeat.EU leaders on Thursday scrapped promises to compromise on the post-Brexit backstop — which could tie the UK to EU customs rules indefinitely.Sources claimed EU leaders pulled the plug on concessions after the PM admitted they may not be enough to win the support of Parliament. But at her own press conference yesterday, a defiant Mrs May insisted it was still possible to get the assurances MPs need — such as time-limiting the backstop.She said: “There is work to be done. It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarication.”But legal experts yesterday said her claims the official conclusions had “legal status” were wrong.Labour said it was clear her deal was now “dead in the water”.It also opens the door to more talks on developing bilateral ties in the future.The move means the Swiss will “replicate in substance the vast majority of trade agreements” in force with the UK, even in a No Deal.It’s the first of FORTY trade deals Britain currently holds through the EU that it hopes to roll-over.Britain exports around £ billion a year to Switzerland – from jewellery to precious stones and pharmaceuticals.Exports have grown by  per cent over the past  years. Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox said: “This is the first of around  trade agreements that we will provide continuity for and many other agreements are also close to being agreed.“It is a vital part of our no deal planning and it means that businesses and consumers can continue to benefit from our close trading relationships with the world beyond the European Union.”Former Tory minister Nick Boles said it was now time for the PM to include Jeremy Corbyn and other parties in her Brexit plan.DUP leader Arlene Foster urged the PM to “stand up to” the EU and not “roll over” like before.And ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the EU would give ground only when the PM threatens to walk away.

We have tried to take up the concerns expressed by Great Britain.“What we have said aren’t just sheets of paper, they are conclusions by the Member States.”And Dutch PM Mark Rutte said he believes the PM now has “all the arguments necessary to get it through parliament”.He told The Sun: “This idea in the British Parliament that they’ll get stuck in the backstop for ,, years is absolutely not necessary.”But the assurances were a far cry from those mooted earlier this week by British and EU officials.They had stitched together a two-step strategy to throw Mrs May a political leline over the Irish border.It was meant to begin with a pledge from Brussels this week to “examine whether any further assurance can be provided” on the backstop.This would have been followed by an emergency Brexit summit in January at which new wording would have been provided to try and assuage rebellious MPs.But the plan, cooked up by Mrs May’s top negotiator Olly Robbins and Eurocrats from the Commission and Council, enraged Dublin and was ditched.According to sources the PM asked for a legal assurance that the EU would do its utmost to ensure the backstop could only be in place for a year at maximum.The document would take a similar form to one the EU granted the Belgian region of Wallonia after it threatened to veto a trade deal with Canada.But the plan, drawn up before the Wednesdays no confidence vote, was fatally undermined when Member States saw how many Conservative MPs went against her in the No Confidence vote.A diplomat told The Sun: “There’s an ever increasing frustration and maybe time is now running out.“That’s the change of mood now. The time’s done when we’re going to come up with solutions.“They say they want a Walloon-style clarication of best endeavours that the backstop will only last one year.“But are we going to do that now in the knowledge it’ll just get voted down by the UK parliament and we could have a new British leader ”EU leaders, who were not consulted as the plan was being stitched up, were said to be “frustrated” at Mrs May’s vagueness throughout this week’s summit.A second diplomat told The Sun: “Everybody understands the situation and everybody wants to help the UK but we don’t know how.”And a third source added: “Colleagues were so exasperated that she left with less than she could have got.”The furore came after some EU leaders taunted Mrs May for failing to have a proper Brexit plan.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė tweeted: “Brexit Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver.”Meanwhile Belgium’s PM Charles Michel warned the UK sounded like reneging on its commitments over Ireland and warned doing so would lead to no deal.He said: “The signals we heard yesterday were not particularly reassuring on Britain’s capacity to honour the commitments that were made.“So we will make sure to prepare for all scenarios and prepare also for a no deal scenario.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, hopefully, I can make you feel better about it, by letting you know that the people responsible for the merde-show are having an even more miserable time than you. Yes, I’ve got the inside track on last night’s Tory Party Christmas Concert, which by all accounts, saw more blood-stained scraps than a butcher’s dog. Celebrity supporters handed out gts to chosen charities. Jim Davidson presented a pregnant homeless woman with straw and told her “when Mary had no inn to kip in she found a stable, so get off’ve our streets”. Which drew much applause. When Kirstie Allsopp gave an iPad to a pair of Barnardo’s orphans then took it back and smashed it “for their own good” the cheers were even louder.

The German Chancellor briefly stunned reporters in Brussels when asked by a British journalist how she would react to the country staying in the European Union. To some surprise in the room, she said Germany would work to prevent that happening. We would of course take note of that, she told journalists. You know we are preparing for such an eventuality, but in terms of what is in my power and what we can take responsibility for, we will do everything to ensure that this does not happen, she replied, before coughing.  Merkel, who was suffering from a cold throughout a two-day EU summit in Brussels, appeared to think she had been asked what she would do in the event of a disruptive no-deal Brexit. Her spokesman promptly told her that she had misheard the question, and she rephrased her answer. Ah, right, she said. That is a totally speculative question, and I never answer those. It comes as Theresa May admitted she had a robust discussion with European Council President Jean-Claude Juncker at the disastrous Brexit summit. Mrs May was caught on camera furiously remonstrating with the euro chief. According to the Mirrors lip-reading experts, she was complaining about Juncker referring to her and her negotiating position as nebulous. And at a press conference this afternoon, she admitted she had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker.  She added: I think thats the sort of discussion youre able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together. And what came out of that was his clarity that actually hed been talking - when he used that particular phrase [nebulous] - hed been talking about a general level of debate. Mrs May said: The EU is clear, as I am, thatwe are going to leave with a deal, this is it. But my discussions with colleagues today have shown that further clarication and discussion following the councils conclusions is in fact possible. There is work still to do and we will be holding talks in coming days about how to obtain the further assurances that the UK Parliament needs in order to be able to approve the deal.  Following reports that European Commission president Mr Juncker had described her presentation to EU leaders on Thursday as nebulous, Mrs May said: I was crystal clear about the assurances that were needed on the backstop, having heard the views of MPs in the House of Commons. Mrs May said it was in the interests of the EU and UK to get this over the line, warning: A disorderly Brexit would be good for no-one. She said that the EU conclusions made clear that the EU is determined to work speedily on a future relationship - or alternative arrangements - to ensure by the end of  that there will be no hard border in Ireland, so that the backstop need not be triggered. The conclusions confirm that any backstop would be temporary and that,it was ever needed, the EU would negotiate expeditiously an agreement to put a replacement in place.  She said: As formal conclusions, these commitments have legal status and therefore should be welcomed. But she said she had discussed with EU leaders, including Mr Juncker and Council President Donald Tusk, the fact that MPs would require further assurances. She said: It is in the overwhelming interest of all our people in the EU and the UK to get this done and as quickly as possible.  Mrs May managed a smile when a reporter she looked like she had had a trying week, jokingly replying: Has something happened this week  When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it was our duty as a Government and as a Parliament to see Brexit through. She added: I never said it was going to be easy. Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.

The Prime Minister has not even got a scrap of paper to wave at MPs when she addresses them on Monday and as a result the Brexit process remains as deadlocked as ever. Having a rebellious party and a ided Cabinet has not helped, nor has having to deal with insolent Jean-Claude Juncker, clearly unsuited to be EU Commission President. But the Prime Minister is primarily responsible for this sorry state of affairs. It was she who triggered Article  without any clear negotiating objectives, she who set down red lines which she later had to erase.  And it was she who over-promised to her backbenchers by making a commitment on the Irish backstop she knew she was incapable of honouring. Unable to chart a way forward and too weak to impose her authority, her answer is to play for time and kick the can down the road again. If she cannot find a path through then the only solution is to hand the task to Parliament.

From putting foliage in our living rooms to pretending that sausages wrapped in bacon are a vegetable, we dont half have some strange traditions at this time of year. So to celebrate the hilariously dysal Dave family at Christmas, weve come up with the  weirdest of them all! Thats one for every day of Christmas, apart from the tenth, because who really has room for  lords, leaping or otherwise.  And dont forget, Christmas on Dave continues tonight at :pm with Alan Davies: Xmas Untitled.  Sending cards to people we live with  There are some very good reasons for sending Christmas cards to people you are not going to see at Christmas. For instance, whatyour Auntie Flo thinks that, unaccountably, you dont want her to have a Merry Christmas and or Happy New Year  You can put her mind at rest with regard to whether you wish her Seasons Greetings with a simple trip to the post box. But do we really need to give Christmas cards to people who use the same bar of soap as you  Do we really need to risk a paper cut on the tongue to wish close family members a cool Yule, when you could just shout it into their faces  Yes, apparently we do.  Putting foliage in your living room  - “What are you doing, Brian ” - “Ive just been out to cut down a tree.” - “What, for firewood ” - “No, I am going to bring it indoors.” - “What, an entire living tree ” - “Of course not!” - “Good!” - “Its dead now. Anyway, Im going to stand it up in a bucket and then cover its slowly drying and decaying branches with glittering scarves, shiny balls, and colourful lights.” - “But thats insane.” - “Yes, but its December.” - “Fair enough, carry on.”  Going to the work do  Ah, the office Christmas party! What are we thinking  Whose idea was it to say, “I know, lets gather together people we have to pay to spend time together normally, with all their resentments about the tea round, and put them in a big room with loud music and freely flowing alcohol. What could possibly go wrong ” Indeed, what could possibly go wrong with getting roaring drunk on a night out with your boss   Blackmailing children into behaving  We spend most of the year telling children to beware of strangers. And then, from the middle of November, we tell them that,they be good, a man with a big beard and a sack will break into their home in the dead of night and leave some presents behind. And all the children hear is “be good” and “presents”. And now we have introduced the element of a -hour snitch, the elf on a shelf, to keep our kids honest, in case they were a bit suspicious of Father Christmass ability to find out whos been naughty or nice. Of course, the clever kids keep it to themselves that theyve realised that they get Christmas presents from everybody they know except their parents. Hmm...  Getting an early start Alcohol plays a prominent part in the typical family Christmas. Indeed, it might even be essential, depending on which relatives are visiting. But the important thing is to pace yourself. Dont peak too soon. It would be mad, say, to start at breakfast time. Unless youre putting champagne in your orange juice. Straight off the bat, thats one of your five-a-day. Orange juice and grape juice  That might actually be two of your five-a-day. Its practically a health drink… right   Pretending that satsumas are a treat  Its , for heavens sake. Stop treating easily obtainable citrus fruit as an exotic jewel from the mystic east. Its a Christmas stocking, not your childrens lunch box.  Doing Christmas dinner “with a twist”  OK, OK. Christmas dinner is predictable. But guess what  Its supposed to be. You dont complain there isnt a surprising “-past Belgium” between five-past two and ten-past two on the clock, so dont grumble about the fact its turkey again. You remember what happened when you had goose that year  Exactly. Anyway,youre making Christmas dinner, you are allowed to have only one item “with a twist” or theres going to be mutiny. And, realistically, that means you get to do something fiddly with sprouts. In fact, its chestnuts. Its always chestnuts.  Pretending that sausages wrapped in bacon are a vegetable  Christmas is no time for a vegetarian. The centrepiece of the festive dinner is some meat stuffed with more meat. And then, to garnish this, we add some cylinders of meat wrapped in more meat. And somehow we can eat as many of these cylinders as we like, because its basically just like eating extra carrots or sprouts. Christmas dinner is the the only dinner where you can feel relatively virtuous by eating a roast potato.  Sabotaging pudding  Imagine youre eating a nice dessert, in a restaurant, say. Perhaps a lovely sticky toffee pudding. And youre tucking in happily. And then you bite down on a hard piece of metal. Would you call over the waiter and ask him to pass on your compliments to the chef  Or would you leave a very tart review on TripAdvisor  But at Christmas finding an actual coin in your pudding is considered lucky, rather than actionable. It isnt even an accident. Somebody, in fact, a supposed loved one, has intentionally put shrapnel in your dessert. All you can hope is that one of the crackers has instructions on the Heimlich manoeuvre inside.  Playing board games  It always seems like a good idea at the time. What could be nicer than getting the family around the table to play a game after the Christmas dinner has been cleared away  The family, they say, that plays together stays together. The problem is that the family that plays together, cant decide which game theyre going to play. Nor can they agree on the rules, even though theyre very clearly printed on the box. But there is only one game to which everybody knows the rules, and that is snakes and ladders, and it is impossible to cheat in snakes and ladders on behalf of your six-year-old child. Andyour overtired six-year-old child, who has been up since ., cant win, nobody wins.

Laura Kiseliova and Raimondas Titas imported dozens of breeds of designer dogs and cats from eastern Europe on illegal pet passports. The animals, who caught diseases in the squalid conditions, were then sold on to unsuspecting members of the public. Its thought the deceitful duo reaped more than pound, from their cruel enterprise, an illegal puppy farming website called Pets.   When customers arrived at their home in Salford, Greater Manchester they were sold incredibly ill puppies who hadnt been given important vaccinations. The pair were sentenced to years behind bars at Manchester Crown Court in their absence, as they fled abroad before Thursdays hearing. They had previously pleaded guilty to a total of  charges, including several animal welfare offences. RSPCA inspectors, police and trading standards found  dogs and eight cats when they searched their previous home in Prestwich on November , . Officers also found more than  pet passports which didnt match the dogs at the property, suggesting they were passing off trafficked dogs as those bred in the UK. The dogs who were found included French bulldogs and pugs, as well as pedigree cats, which were being sold for between pound and pound, each. The pair were charged with a number of offences, including failing to provide them with a suitable environment, and failing to provide veterinary care. But before Thursdays hearing, they are believed to have fled the country to hide in Eastern Europe.An European Arrest Warrant has been issued.   One of the RSPCA investigators leading the operation, who didnt want to be named, said: The front room of the property was being used to sell the animals to members of the public but it was when you entered the rest of the house the scale of this operation became apparent. “There were cages and pens containing dferent breeds of dogs in almost every room including a litter of puppies in a filthy ensuite bathroom upstairs. In a large garage at the back we found cages of animals stacked on top of each other. “It was clear there were some cats and puppies that needed immediate veterinary treatment and sadly two of the puppies that were rushed to the vets for treatment later died from parvovirus. “There was little sign of proper isolation pens for sick animals or biosecurity measures meaning any animal that passed through this place would be at risk of catching and spreading diseases and parasites. “This was a large money-making operation at the expense of the welfare of the animals and the unsuspecting members of public who thought they were buying healthy, happy puppies.”  RSPCA SOU Chief Insp Ian Briggs said: “It was obvious that this duo were dealing and trading in a large number of animals and that many of them were not receiving the appropriate care and veterinary attention they needed. “Some of the animals were suffering from problems such as conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis or had sore and infected wounds.” Most of the animals have been signed over into RSPCA care and have been rehomed. Chief Insp Briggs added: “We have seen a concerning increase in the number of calls we are receiving about large-scale traders dealing, predominantly, in puppies.  “We are regularly appalled by the conditions we find puppies living in and the stories we hear from owners who have, just days after bringing their puppy home, held their new dog as he died in their arms from preventable diseases and infections. “Unfortunately, a major factor in this trade is traffickers - such as this pair - bringing in poorly pups from abroad, without the right vaccinations and documents, and selling them to unsuspecting buyers here in England.” Kiseliova, , was sentenced to a total of four years in prison while Titas, , was jailed for three years and six months. The pair have also been banned from keeping pets for le.  Case vet David Martin said: “Many of the dogs and the cats that were removed from this address were suffering from serious infections which had the potential to make not only the puppies themselves ill but also were a signicant risk to both other animals within the purchaser’s home and to the purchasers and their families. “Great care needs to be taken when purchasing a puppy and any puppy that is off colour or unwell must receive urgent veterinary attention. It is imperative that the veterinary surgeon who examines the puppy is made fully aware of the potential for the puppy to have come from a puppy farm as many of the serious and fatal conditions that puppies from puppy farms commonly have start with very mild signs which can easily be mistaken as being related to the stress of a new home before the puppy rapidly declines, at which point it may be too late to save the puppy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ice cream parlour serving brussels","story":"NewsIce cream parlour serving BRUSSELS SPROUT flavour for the Christmas periodThe controversial concoction sprouted up on the menu an Aberdeen ice cream parlourShareCommentsByLuke KentonSarah Ward:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe controversial concoction is expected to ide opinion among ice cream lovers \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scottish eatery is serving up ice cream made with SPROUTS in the run up to Christmas.

The takeaway was also handed a zero food hygiene score meaning urgent improvements were necessary, or the owner, Mr Yousaf Khan, would be at risk of having to permanently close up shop. The takeaway was visited on October  and a number of issues were raised by the examiner.  In a report, the surveyor cited an extensive list of problems regarding cleanliness. From dirty refrigerators to collections of dead flies, the area was deemed unfit for use and a potential hazard for customer health. It said: “The premises were found to be generally filthy throughout. Food premises and equipment fixed to the structure must be kept clean and maintained in good repair and condition.” Concerns were also raised over food storage and contamination. The inspector said: “Although you advised that most of your raw meat is bought in pre-prepared, you did state that in some instances, you are preparing raw meat on site yourself, along with making the chicken kebabs. “Concerns were raised in connection to this as your cross contamination controls were not acceptable.” The inspector was also worried about the state of the cleaning equipment. She said: “Dirty tea towels and dirty scouring pads were found to be in use at the premises at the time of the inspection. “All types of cleaning cloths must be kept clean, disinfected and replaced regularly.”  A lack of labelling to ensure all food was in date was an additional issue, while there was no system in place to identy allergens.

The inspector said: “You carried out a full deep clean overnight, and when I revisited the following day I was satisfied that the level of cleaning that had taken place was enough to allow you to reopen for trade.”  Mr. Khan insists all the concerns have now been addressed and is confident customers should not be worried. He said: “The inspector told us to close to carry out a deep clean which we did. She came back the next day and seemed happy and allowed us to reopen. “I have been in this business  years and I don’t think we deserved a zero. “It was not mega work to get it up to scratch.

Miss Scolaro has a very active engagement with social media and in particular with an Instagram channel which she operates and manages. Shes been described in some quarters as influential in terms of fashion, in particular with young people. These articles are shown on her Instagram channel and were also offered for sale on a website she owned and operation called SS Python and though inidual sale trader outlets with which she formed an arrangement to sell the goods. There were  illegal snake-skin goods which included baseball caps, large hold-all bags and smaller bags. But she caught when German customs intercepted  caps and a large and small bag as they were air freighted from Indonesia to the UK. Mr McKinley said: These caps, one large and one small bag, were intercepted by the German customs police at Leipzig airport on November .  The German authorities informed the British authorities of the consignment and allowed it to continue into the UK. The consignment was directly addressed to Miss Scolaro at an address associated with her parents address in Curzon street. It was with the forwarding company DHL at the same time as the police were making enquiries. Scolaro tried to find out where her goods were but was told by DHL to contact the sender. Police then began an investigation in the Instagram stars affairs and found she was selling the snake-skin accessories on her website, Instagram account and with small traders in London. Mr McKinley said: One count refers to a small fashion outlet in Bexleyheath. One of those caps was on sale there and the owner of that shop said he paid Miss Scolaro pound for it but her suggested retail price was pound. As part of the police investigation, caps addressed to her were confiscated at Heathrow Airport while five were found in another shop on sale for hundreds of pounds. The prosecutor said: Three were on sale for pound and two were on sale for pound. Mr McKinley said Scolaro refused to cooperate in locating the goods and gave a no comment interview. He said: All of the investigation has been by the police from the website and the Instagram account and without any cooperation from the defendant for finding this items and where they have been on sale.  There are some  of these baseball caps. If we take the retail value as was suggested by the defendant herself, it amounts to about pound, the value of these hats comes to pound,. The large bags which were intercepted were advertised on the website for pound,. We dont have an estimated value for the small bags but the large bags and hats comes to pound,. When the goods came for Indonesia they had documents purporting to be export permits with them. But Mr McKinley said: Both of these documents have been checked and both are forgeries. The maximum penalties on the regulatory offences is five years on each of these offences. And the customs and excise management offence is a maximum of seven years. Judge Michael Gledhill said: I still take a very dim view of this. Were talking about the same category of offending that members of the public will be more readily aware of. Its includes ivory from elephants and Rhinos. Scolaro will be sentenced at the same court next month.

Half-sister Samantha, also a daughter of Thomas Markle Snr, said the Duchess of Sussex received presents fit for a princess as a child. Royal biographer Andrew Morton says that Samantha always thought Meghan was the favourite of Thomas three children. And because of that she would always get what she asked for at Christmas - no matter how expensive. In his book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, Andrew describes how Samantha often told the story of the time before Christmas when Meghan was looking at a jewellery catalogue and picking out a ring, which Tom Senior promised as a gt.  The book also claims that Meghan teased her much older sister by saying that whatever her father bought [her half-sister Samantha], Meghan would receive the most expensive gt as she was the most favoured child. Samantha Markles relationship with her half-sister rapidly broke down when Thomas Markle experienced bad health and had to miss Meghans Windsor wedding to Prince Harry in May. In the end Meghans mum, Doria Ragland, was the only member of her family who was invited to the stunning ceremony.  The biographers book also says that Thomas Markle Snr bought his youngest daughter two sets of dolls of dferent races to echo her mixed-race household. The biographer added: He bought one with black dolls, one with white and mixed them together to represent Meghans own family. Then he wrapped them in sparkly Christmas paper and placed the box under the tree.

Maybe they just want their own space . “Things are civil between the couples but they don’t spend much time together.” The news comes amid reports of a feud between the two families.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided to set up home in Windsor - away from Will and Kate - to raise a family in a quieter setting. One royal source suggested the move could be down to friction between Meghan and Kate which has driven wedge between the two brothers. Kate and Meghan are very dferent people. They dont really get on, an insider told the Daily Mail . It was also reported that Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland will not be at Sandringham despite being invited, according to the Sun.  Christmas at the royal stately home in Norfolk is a traditional, and sometimes stling, affair. Royal biographer Christopher Wilson said: “Sandringham Christmases can be an ordeal, even for those born royal — and generally those who’ve married into the family can’t wait to get away.

If you would rather not because you feel it could put you in a compromising position thats a valid reason and okay. Theres nothing wrong with saying no either.

The claims - which Jenner has publicly denied - emerged in a court document on Friday, with an unnamed woman claiming he forcibly performed oral sex on her in . According to the lawsuit, Weinstein pushed the unnamed actress to the ground during a meeting at his office and sexually assaulted her. When she rejected his advances, Weinstein is alleged to have asked, Do you even want to be an actress ” She claims He later added I slept with Jenner Lawrence and look where she is she has just won an Oscar.”  Since , more than  women have accused the -year-old of sexual misconduct or sexual assault. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Jenner Lawrence issued a statement on Friday rebutting any claims she had a sexual relationship with Weinstein. She said: My heart breaks for all the women who were victimised by Harvey Weinstein. I have never had anything but a professional relationship with him. This is yet another example of the predatory tactics and lies that he engaged in to lure countless women. The latest accuser, listed in legal documents as Jane Doe, is suing both Weinstein and The Weinstein Company, the film studio he founded with his brother Bob. She is filing the suit on the alleged grounds of sexual battery and discrimination.  A representative for Weinstein said the lawsuit was malicious and that the movie mogul is embarrassed that Lawrence has sadly been dragged into this ugly attempt at defamation. They said: This lawsuit was filed and updated strategically with no notice given or any attempt to reach out to Mr Weinsteins attorneys for one reason It was meant to embarrass Mr Weinstein and garner unchecked media attention. There is absolutely no truth to the malicious claims made in this lawsuit, and we are reviewing our options with an eye on filing for an immediate dismissal. Mr Weinstein is embarrassed for Ms Lawrence with whom he has only had a professional and respectful relationship, who has sadly been dragged into this ugly attempt at defamation. This filing further proves that anyone can say whatever they want in a lawsuit for maximum shock value, to defame and debase, without having to offer any facts or reality.

Those six words signalled the end of one of the most intense manhunts in history - Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had been caught.The tyrant had spent nine months on the run and evading US forces, but now his time was up. As he crawled out of the spider hole looking disheveled and unrecognisable with a salt and pepper beard, he shouted at the soldiers who found him: dont shoot, dont shoot. “I am Saddam Hussein, he added. I am the president of Iraq, and I am willing to negotiate.”To which one of them replied: “President Bush sends regards.”  This week marks  years since the extraordinary operation - named Red Dawn - came to jubilant end.

He would go on to replace it with an Iraqi flag, winding it round the dictator’s throat like a cravat, before the statue was pulled down to huge cheers.

It is never going to go.People say racism is taught.At a certain age it is taught.If you are three, four, five, six, seven, eight and you come out with something that you have obviously heard around the home and people you are around, I get that.That stuff withSterling and Scotty Sinclair, the stuff with me. You are not taught that.That one who did that against Sterling. He has chosen to say those things, to try to say the most hateful and hurtful things to somebody.The person in the Scott Sinclair video.That guy is taking a penalty against Aberdeen and he doesn’t want him to score against his team.But why would you ever bring up somebody’s race  I have arguments with loads of people and it doesn’t once cross my mind to bring in what colour I am looking at. Because when I am looking at someone I am looking at a human being.It doesn’t matter what colour they are. So to say something like that, it is your choice.When you are an adult and you get past  to  anything you then come out with or your actions, it’s all down to choice from you.Anything that comes out of your mouth no one can make you say that, unless you choose to say it.It is never going to be gone.I’m not going to say it might be the next game or the next game but there will be a time in a game when somebody feels they want to choose to say something like that.For me you can stand and say it in my face, it doesn’t bother me.I just highlight it because I just want people to know that people like that are still out there.Whether it is an Aberdeen fan saying it against a Celtic player, Rangers player, Hibs player or Dundee player. It is irrelevant who is saying it because I will never be on their side whether they are an Aberdeen fan or not.In this day, it is  and I just think it is despicable.You have to choose your words correctly.If you want to say it, say it – but you will be judged on it.This guy who did it against Sterling had a nice job but he chose to say a word against a player who is playing against his football team.Now he has lost it. Is it really worth it  No.No. It is not just in football, you get it in all forms of le. Football is a job. You are going to get it in a factory, get it in a swimming pool, a library.Racism happens all over and it is a choice. It is sad that it is still going on nowadays but poverty and unemployment are happening now. Things can be done to help prevent itand try to make it better but it is always going to be there.Bullying, poverty, racism you will never get a world when that isn’t there.For me personally I bring up my kiddies and I want them to respect everybody.I always say, show respect to anybody who shows you respect.Andthey don’t show respect walk away from them.You don’t have to be around people like that. If everyone had that idea, I don’t think everyone does, then it would be a better place. That sort of thing might not happen so much, but I guarantee it will happen again.Yes, loads of times.Even now people say about the Tonev thing, there was no proof. But there was proof.They didn’t see the video recordings of the game in the room that we were all in. So they don’t know what has gone on.I would never try to say anyone did anything to me racist to ruin anyone’s career.I am not that person.So when I go and get a ball and people are shouting at me I don’t report it. It is irrelevant to me.You can say whatever you like about me, I’m playing a game of football and you are trying to hurt me.We are probably winning the game and that is why you are upset.Becauseyour team are winning you are not going to say anything.It is only when the chips are down, you are frustrated, that those sort of things come out. Loads of times people have said things.And you know what  It hasn’t been the bigger games and it seems to be against the same sort of teams.I don’t ever bring it up.You can say it to my face and I walk away. It doesn’t bother me.That is what I put up with – it is water off a duck’s back.I am black, I get that.My kiddies are black. I have a white mum, my dad’s black.I have a white nan, I have a white brother.It doesn’t matter to me what colour you are.I love all sorts of people and I show anybody respect who shows me respect.Tonev did not show me respect so I showed him no respect in terms of I reported that. Because he is a professional footballer and at the time there were four or five black people on his team.So you have just said that to me.It was a lack of respect.It is what it is, you don’t cry about spilt milk and that stuff is in the past.I am sure there will be, maybe not towards me, but there will be racism in the game.You just have to deal with it.I think there are bigger issues as well such as the situation with Leigh Grfiths who is struggling with depression or habits.He needs help.Someone shouting things at me, I am of the mindset that it is not affecting my le or my career.Leigh is in a position where the stuff is affecting his le so the focus needs to go on that.Things where people feel in a position where they are really struggling with le.With just getting out of bed.People see him driving a flash car, playing football for a big club but they don’t see behind it when he is at home.When in his head he is thinking all these things.They are the sort of people who need help and I hope he can get all the help he needs."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen students make splash in photography competition","story":"Students at an Aberdeen college have taken part in a photography competition.The contest for North East Scotland Collegewas held in partnership with Aberdeen Harbour Board.Dons boss Derek McInnes and renowned photographer Colin Prior helped select this year’s winners from around  entries.They joined fellow judges Chris Bain, external relations director at Aberdeen Harbour, Claire Cormack, owner of Raven Red, and college lecturer Steve Smith.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of

We are looking to be trading from March next year.Love Sweets and Ices has been trading on the opposite side of the road from the former bank for six years.However, a sweet shop on the site dates back more than  years.Mr Love said that the shop would be based in the front of the former bank, with rooms such as the managerrsquos office used for storage.Philip Mellor, chairman of the Dunbar Tradesrsquo Association , was pleased to see the building being brought back into use.He said: ldquoThe redevelopment of the old RBS bank on the High Street further demonstrates the demand for retail space in Dunbar.ldquoWe wish the new owners every success with the refurbishment of this iconic building and welcome the plans that Love Sweets and Ices has for the space.A decision to close  RBS and  NatWest branches came at the end of last year, with RBS branches in North Berwick and Dunbar shutting.The move was widely criticised by local politicians, with ward councillor Paul McLennan among those unhappy at the decision.In January, he said: ldquoThe social and community impact on the North Berwick and Dunbar communities of these branch closures will be substantial.ldquoThe RBS in Dunbar is in the centre of the town and will impact on the sustainability of High Street."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-gray-why-we-must-remember-srebrenica","story":"THIS year I attended many events in East Lothian marking the end of the First World War  years ago, not least the moving drumhead service by the Moderator of the Church of Scotland in Haddington on November .The following day, I found myself standing in remembrance as anotherModerator, the Very Rev Lorna Hood, said a few words on the exact spot where that war began, rather than ended.I was in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on the street corner where in  Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Ferdinand, igniting the chain of events which engulfed the world in war for four long years.Our main purpose, though, was to learn about a much more recent conflict, the Balkans war of the s, on a delegation organised by the Remembering Srebrenica Scotland charity, which Lorna chairs.Just as the Second World War revealed that we had not learned from that first ldquowar to end all wars, so in  the Bosnian town of Srebrenica showed that we had not learned the lessons of the Holocaust, as genocide took place again on European soil while the world stood by and watched.Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims had lived together peacefully. However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Itrsquos time for Mrs May to resign. Letrsquos not vex ourselves with trles like an election. Mr Rees-Mogg had decided that the entire country now needed a new leader because, well ... this just wonrsquot do.Elsewhere at Westminster another Tory with multiple names and a baronial pile had a warning for his party and the country. Before Mrs Mayrsquos confidence vote Michael Heseltine had talked portentously of the prospect of no-deal and a Prime Minister now lacking all authority to govern. But there was no hint of arrogance in his words and none of the thwarted assumption that suffused the words of his fellow aristocrat. A few days earlier Lord Heseltine had called for a second referendum on Brexit and offered a similar warning to the Conservatives: Britainrsquos youth ldquowould never forgive usthey were denied the chance to reverse Brexit. He added: ldquoThose of a certain age who voted : to leave are rapidly being replaced by a younger generation who voted : to stay.Mr Rees-Mogg gives the impression that he has arrived at this juncture in his le never having understood the concept of youth or encountered any of the strange people who belong to this sect. Was there not a slightly jaded fascination to be had from observing the dferent approaches of these two men, who between them would seem to embody the values, fears and aspirations of the Tories and those who entrust their land and money to them  Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Heseltine had been kissed by privilege at birth their adult lives anointed by wealth and property. They had sprung from families who expected to rule or to maintain the influence of those who actually did. Each of them, having become a Conservative MP, had rebelled against their leaders.Lord Heseltinersquos revolt occurred in  when, as Defence Secretary, he faced down Margaret Thatcher in a cabinet dispute about the future of Westland helicopters, the UKrsquos last remaining manufacturer of helicopters. Mrs Thatcher favoured a merger with the US company, Sikorsky, while Mr Heseltine sought a deal with a European consortium that included British, Italian and French firms. He resigned because he felt that his boss had treated her cabinet with contempt over the deal and that it had raised questions over the integrity of senior politicians. His protest came from a seat of considerable influence within the UK Government and was driven by principle.Until three years ago Mr Rees-Mogg was little more than a curiosity within his own party who might once have featured in childrenrsquos tours of the House of Commons. His rebellion is at the head of a group of hard-right \"extremists\" in the words of Philip Hammond, the Chancellor. It was not sparked by any sense of ethics or integrity but by opportunism. It seeks to exploit an unstable moment in British history to bring about the top-down, class-driven society of their childhood storybooks and one free from any interference on frustrating issues like human rights or moral obligations to people fleeing death and torture.A chasm seems to be apparent in how each man views the world and the responsibilities that come with wealth and privilege. Never being slow to proclaim his Christian faith Mr Rees-Mogg may be familiar with Luke :. \"From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. Yet while Mr Rees-Mogg may have read this passage it would seem that Lord Heseltine might actually have understood them. It would be easy for those of a younger generation to be suspicious when an ageing Tory speaks with a degree of compassion. Isnrsquot this what all elderly and affluent men do as they begin to reflect on their mortality and the legendary dficulties encountered by people like these in attempting to access the Kingdom of Heaven Some may deride the concept of a high Tory with a sense of social justice and moral obligation but insofar as this can be imagined Lord Heseltine could be considered one example of such. It may seem dficult to comprehend now but once upon a time the concept of One Nation Toryism enjoyed considerable status within the Toriesrsquo philosophy. This was epitomised by Lord Heseltine when he became an authentic and hard-working advocate for the city of Liverpool as it began to be consumed by an economic apocalypse. He helped drive a visionary and sustainable regeneration in Liverpool and was awarded the honour of Freeman of the City for his endeavours. This was at a time when Mrs Thatcher was preaching her gospel of ldquosurvival of the richest and seeking to dismantle society and Englandrsquos northern working-class communities.Her latterday acolytes are maintaining those wretched values by attempting to create their ldquohostile environment for the Windrush generation and any communities they consider to be somehow less than authentically British. They can be observed in the imposition of universal credit and the nasty and vindictive little stunt pulled by the Department of Work and Pensions this week in depriving Universal Credit claimants their annual one-off pound bonus. If Jacob Rees-Mogg and his band of hard-right Thatcherites get their way another hostile environment for those they consider to be not quite British enough will emerge from their quest to thwart anything but the hardest of hard Brexits.Theresa May will probably fall and she will be replaced by someone like Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab or Michael Gove or Sajid Javid, a man whose incoherent ramblings on the floor of the Commons this week made you tremble that he could ever be thought of as Prime Minister. Once, this list would have included men like William Whitelaw, Sir Geoffrey Howe and later, perhaps Kenneth Clarke. Lord Heseltine would have been there, too, and he must have wept as Mr Javid mumbled and muttered last week while the rest of us

sexual misconduct from two women, which he strongly denies.His legal team insist the process was unfair, and argue the civil servant appointed to investigate the complaints was biased because she had prior knowledge of them.Judge Lord Pentland ruled a batch of emails and notes will now be handed to an external commissioner, Morag Ross QC, to decide whether their contents are relevant.They were previously substantially redacted by the Scottish Government, which argued the documents arecovered by a confidentiality agreement.Lord Pentland said: ldquoEssentially, Irsquom satisfied that it is in the interest of justice for this to be done.ldquoI have given careful consideration to the fact that the respondent gave qualied assurance of confidentiality to Ms A and Ms B.ldquoThe law is clear and

to the case.Further disclosures mdash including hand-written notes and text messages between one of the complainers and a civil servant mdash were released to Mr Salmondrsquos team at .pm on Thursday.Mr Clancy said the documents showed Scottish Government official Judith Mackinnon was appointed to investigate the complaints despite having prior knowledge of them.He said Ms Mackinnon had previously spoken to one of the complainers and met the other, and was identied as the ldquopoint of contact for one of the women.She was also sent an internal email about one of the complaints.This is despite HR rules stipulating the investigating officer should have no prior involvement in the matter, Mr Clancy said.He insisted the ldquofull extent of Ms Mackinnonrsquos prior knowledge needed to be made clear, adding: ldquoWe need to see the material for ourselves.The court heard one of the formal complaints against Mr Salmond was four pages long, but every paragraph except the first was

However, it is possible that people will not notice much change at that point, as the UK has negotiated a -month transition period ending on December   during which it will continue to operate largely under EU rules, but without representation in Brussels institutions. That period could itself be extended to December  . And after that there could be a ldquobackstop period of unlimited duration, during which the UK would remain in a customs union.ndash Why is March  Brexit day Under the Article  process, the EU treaties cease to have effect in a member state exactly two years after the country informs the European Council of its intention to leave. Britainrsquos EU ambassador Sir Tim Barrow handed over a letter from Theresa May to council president Donald Tusk on March  , setting the process in train. The UK actually leaves at midnight Brussels time, which is pm in Britain.ndash Can it be delayed Yes. The European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can revoke its Article  letter unilaterally and continue as a full EU member without seeking approval from Brussels. It is also possible to extend the Article  process, but this requires unanimous agreement from both the UK and the other  member states.ndash Is there an agreement on what happens after Brexit There is a Withdrawal Agreement agreed by the UK Government and European Commission and approved by leaders of the  remaining states in November. This covers issues such as the pound billion settlement of UK liabilities to EU budgets and the treatment of expat citizens, as well as arrangements to keep the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic open. Alongside this is a Political Declaration, setting out plans to forge a close future relationship in areas such as trade and security, with negotiations due to start once Brexit day has passed. However, the deal must be ratied by the House of Commons and the European Parliament before coming into effect.ndash Will Theresa May be able to get the deal through the House of Commons ndash What is the backstop anyway The backstop is effectively an insurance arrangement required by the EU. Once the UK is outside the EU customs area, it can strike its own trade deals with countries such as the US, China or Australia. Brussels is concerned that this could mean imports of goods produced under less rigorous standards in areas such as animal welfare, workplace rights and environmental protection. It insists that such goods ndash like genetically modied crops or chlorine-washed chicken from the US ndash must not be allowed freely to cross what will become the UKrsquos only land border with the EU, between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Neither side wants to erect checkpoints, for fear of reviving tensions from the era of the Troubles and disrupting daily le on both sides of the border. So until a broader trade agreement is sealed, the EU insists that Northern Ireland must remain within the European customs area. On her part, Mrs May insists that the backstop arrangement must cover the whole UK, to avoid creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. Brexit-backing MPs are furious because once the UK is in the backstop it can only leave with agreement from Brussels. They fear it will become a permanent arrangement, preventing Britain from striking lucrative new trade deals.ndash Whatthe PM canrsquot get her deal through Parliament If MPs reject Mrs Mayrsquos deal, she has  days to make a statement to Parliament setting out the next steps the Government will take. MPs will be able to amend her motion to require ministers to take a dferent approach, such as delaying Brexit, calling a second referendum to confirm the  decision to leave or negotiating a ldquosofter withdrawal involving Norway-style membership of the European Free Trade Area. However, the Government retains control over the legislation it puts before Parliament, meaning there are limits to the extent to which MPs can direct ministers on the course to take.ndash Whatwe get to March  with no deal ratied and no delay to the Brexit process The UK would leave the EU without a deal. Provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement on citizensrsquo rights and payments to the EU budget would not take effect and there would be no transition period. Businesses and public authorities would have to switch immediately to trade under World Trade Organisation rules, which require tarfs on a range of goods. The Government is making preparations to ensure that international agreements in areas such as aviation, food safety and data sharing continue to operate. Many experts believe there would be signicant disruption at ports and airports, shortages of food and medicines and queues on motorways, but Brexiteers dismiss these warnings as overblown. Mrs May has promised to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK, but there has been no such commitment from the EU.ndash And could there be a second referendum The letter from the Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru  the Green Party urging Jeremy Corbyn to join them in tabling a motion of no confidence in the PM ndash helping to pave the way for a #PeoplesVote.

union.ldquoI think it is possible to get this deal through with those guarantees that we need on the backstop.ldquoThe reason I think, in the end, the EU will want to help us as far as they possibly can is because it is not in their interest to provoke a further political crisis in the UK.ldquoBecause, although some people in the EU may say that Parliament would stop a no-deal scenario, they canrsquot be sure of that.Ms Rudd, who recently ed to the Cabinet as Work and Pensions Secretary, said it is possible Mrs May will ultimately be unable to persuade enough of her own MPs to back the

approach was needed for MPs to coalesce around a deal to avert the danger of Britain crashing out of the EU.Responding to the remarks, Mr Hunt said: ldquoAmber is absolutely right that we need all MPs to think about the national interest.ldquoBut, I think we also have to be cautious about the idea that we are going to get large amounts of support from the Labour Party.A combative EU summit left Mrs May insisting she was still on track to win assurances on the controversial Irish backstop proposals.Putting a positive gloss on the bruising EU summit, the Prime Minister said further talks would take place in the coming days on measures she hopes will persuade MPs to back the Brexit agreement in Parliament.EU leaders acknowledged the need to ldquobring down the temperature after appearing to rebuff her calls for assurances on the Northern Ireland backstop.EU tensions erupted into public view when a visibly angry Mrs May was seen berating European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker over remarks he had made during the press conference in the early hours of Friday.The Prime Minister was apparently infuriated after he described the British negotiating position as ldquonebulous and imprecise, and called on the Government to spell out exactly what it wanted from the talks.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage said he believes the UK may face a second referendum in the coming months and urged Brexit campaigners to ldquoget ready for every situation.Speaking at the Leave Means Leave rally on Friday, the former Ukip leader said: ldquoMy message, folks, tonight is, as much as I donrsquot want a second referendum, it would be wrong of us on a Leave Means Leave  not to get ready, not to be prepared for a worst-case

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The city’s renowned Festival and Fringe, Hogmanay celebration and other events have also proved to be a powerful attraction.Edinburgh now attracts nearly four million visitors a year and, collectively, they spend an impressive £. billion, supporting the jobs of some , people.However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing and many in the city have come to the conclusion that tourism has now reached that point to the dismay of Gordon Robertson, the chair of Marketing Edinburgh. He told how “everybody hates a tourist” seemed to have become the city’s strapline as people increasingly subscribe to the “tourism bad narrative”.And Robertson is right to raise the alarm over this trend. Scotland’s economy needs all the help it can get and catering for tourists is now an important part of this country’s financial well-being. The only way Scotland is going to tackle poverty, spend more on the NHS and create the kind of country that everyone wants to see is to grow the economy.: Stephen Jardine: Hoaching Edinburgh needs a tourist taxThat said, Robertson perhaps might agree that, in hindsight, his remark that he was “not so sure Disneyfication is a bad thing”, after his family went on a trip to the cartoon-inspired resort, might be a bit of a gt to his opponents.He may have meant Disney’s “well-trained staff” and “fantastic experience”, he may have said “none of us wants to live in a theme park”, but critics who already complain about the Disneyfication of Edinburgh will simply see this as further evidence of their claims.One reason tourists love Edinburgh is its stunning urban landscape: the castle on a hill, Arthur’s Seat, the tangible, living history of the Old and New Towns. There is a place for See-you-Jimmy hat shops, but too many would detract from that.So Edinburgh needs to strike a balance between pleasing tourists and remaining a city where people live and work.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     .."},{"url":null,"title":"college board supports college merger ","story":"Plans to merge tertiary education, research and training in the isles have been backed by the SIC#s college board.A full business case was put before councillors at a meeting this morning, with chairman Peter Campbell saying #this is a meeting that is clearly the most signicant meeting the college board has ever held#.Councillors backed a recommendation that brings together Shetland College, the NAFC Marine Centre and Train Shetland as a new college under the University of Highlands and Islands.It is being discussed at meeting throughout the week, going before the full council on Wednesday.The move, according to the business case would save about £. million over a five-year period “streamlining and maximising the efficiency of the college structure and curriculum, whilst improving outcomes delivered for students and staff”.However, Shetland South councillor George Smith had concerns about the curriculum in future, as well as how a reduction in staff and a push for more income in the plan would work. raquoAs an early Principal of NAFC, and also a Head of Department, Depute Principal and Principal of a Scottish Funding Council funded college offering fisheries and marine education, I would urge Board Members to be extremely cautious regarding the proposed merger.Unless it has changed considerably in the few years since I retired the SFC funding formula strongly mitigates against courses in maritime and engineering related subjects.The funding offered goes nowhere near meeting operational expenditure as it is based on head count with smaller classes being the norm due to the nature of the industry and health and safety considerations.We could only maintain our curriculum at Banff and Buchan due to industry contributions and offering a range of courses where we knew we could attract large numbers to balance the losses on maritime and engineering.The other factor is the large associated capital spend for marine simulation and engineering equipment.With news where of a bumper year for NAFC, be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater..."},{"url":null,"title":"norovirus forces two day closure of dunrossness primary ","story":"Dunrossness Primary School imposed a -hour closure on Thursday after an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug, Norovirus.School officials say the decision to remain shut until Monday follows unfortunate incidents in which both pupils and staff were struck ill by the virus.Director of the council#s children#s services, Helen Budge, said that the decision was made to keep the bug contained.Moves will also be made to clean the school and the time off will also give those affected time to recover.#The decision was taken, and I absolutely think it is the right decision,# she said.#It got to the stage that the number of staff being off meant it was going to make it very dficult to cover everything.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"admin assistant at cope ","story":"We are looking to recruit an enthusiastic person to join our dynamic social enterprise to work in our Finance and Admin team.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

A recent survey of RCGP NImembers found that % of GPs surveyed are concerned their increased workload during the winter months will negatively affect their ability to deliver patient care. The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Were all going to break our hearts over the decision to close, but unfortunately the shutters must come down.\"Club chairman Jim McLarenand trustee and committee member Ed Boyleboth agreed that it would be terribly sad to say a final farewell to the club and its members on December .\"Were hoping that it will be kept as a sports bar and then we will still use it,\" Jim said.\"Otherwise, well probably see other again at funerals and things like that,\" Ed added."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster calls on pm to stand up to eu over backstop as member states veto change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party believes the measure would create an economic border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Responding to the EUs refusal to countenance changes to the withdrawal deal and Mrs Mays failure to secure legal guarantees that the backstop would only ever be temporary, Mrs Foster said: \"The Prime Minister has promised to get legally binding changes. The reaction by the EU is unsurprising.

There will be no legally binding obligations imposed on the withdrawal treaty.\"Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs Mays plan was \"dead in the water\" and reiterated Labours call for a vote on it before Christmas.Last night DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson MP hammered home his partys message to the Prime Minister.Speaking at a rally for Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave, the MP said that the assurances Mrs May was seeking from the EU were worthless.\"From the point of view of Northern Ireland, were not going to accept a situation where we have to regard the rest of the UK as a third country: whether we find ourselves cut off from out main market where we cant take part in trade deals where we find that forever we will have our laws made in Brussels without any input or any ability to change them, regardless of how damaging they are.\"Thats not democracy, thats dictatorship, and well not have it.\"Northern Ireland-born Labour MP Kate Hoey also gave a speech where she said: \"How could any UK Prime Minister agree a deal that separates out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK  As someone who grew up in Northern Ireland, proud, very proud to be pro-Union, I feel very strongly about this.\"We didnt spend in Northern Ireland  years stopping IRA terrorists killing soldiers, police and civilians in order to get a united Ireland, to allow a few jumped-up EU bureaucrats and a complicit Prime Minister to try to do the same thing by the back door.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast mans first christmas with birth mum ruined by gangs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is one of our major fundraisers, so it’s very important. I’m just happy I’m well enough to be here.”She added: “I got clearance from the consultant yesterday he doesn’t need to see me again, so I’m firing on all cylinders and ready for the New Year and getting this million together before July.”Mary’s Race to a Million project, which has already raised two thirds of its target, was launched two years ago to invest enough money to ensure funding for our future sporting champions.The first lady of Northern Ireland sport over five decades said she was delighted with the money amassed so far and said she was touched by the letters and cards she received following her illness.“Everyone has been so helpful in getting me back on my feet again, with all their support,” she said, adding that she has been “given a -year extension” thanks to the surgery.Through her tireless work on her project to secure the future of the trust to aid future generations of young sportsmen and women, the -year-old is undeniably a role model — an accolade she accepts with grace.“I feel very privileged that I can help people realise their dreams, because I didn’t have that kind of support,” Dame Mary added.“AndI can make it easier for them to achieve their dreams then we can get so much joy out of seeing them travelling all over the world as our ambassadors.”Film and TV actor James Nesbitt, yesterday’s compere, said he attends the event every year in honour of his host, whom he described as “the most inspirational person I’ve ever met”.“She is an astonishing woman,” the Cold Feet star said, joking that “when Mary asks you to do something you can’t say no.”He added: “More than any other sporting legend, Mary has been the real beacon, the one person who transcended all sectarian barriers when Northern Ireland was at its worst.“And here she is on the eve of her th birthday, recovering from surgery, looking incredible and continuing to raise money and light a pathway for young and future sporting stars.”He added: “History will show that Mary Peters is the very living notion of why sport matters to everyone.”Former Ulster and Irish Rugby international Paddy Wallace, who was there with his partner Sarah Moore, said it was his third time at the fundraiser.“It’s always good to come and catch up with friends and team mates and to support Mary, who’s such a great ambassador for our wee country,” he said.“She epitomises everything that’s great about Belfast, Northern Ireland and sport. We’ve always punched above our weight and we must continue to ensure we do that.” Gymnast and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Rhys McClenaghan said he was there “to support Mary Peters because she has done so much for me”. He added: “She helped get me onto programmes and that has helped me get to where I am today.”Paralympic gold medallist Michael McKillop said he considered the Munich Olympics pentathlon gold medallist “a friend as much as a fellow athlete”.“I can’t describe how highly I think of her,” he said.“The Mary Peters Trust has supported me over the years, and not just with money. Mary has been a mentor and a friend. She was invited to my wedding in November, that’s how close we are.”Golfer Michael Hoey, who was attending the festive dinner for the first time yesterday, said he was “happy to be here”.“My dad Brian had open heart surgery around the same time as Mary and I’m pleased that they’re both doing so well now,” he added.Ireland hockey team World Cup silver medallists Shirley McCay, Lizzie Colvin and Zoe Wilson were there, as was Northern Ireland football manager Michael O’Neill. And North West  Superbike winner Glenn Irwin made sure he didn’t miss the event after his flight was cancelled from Southampton. He hopped in a taxi to Birmingham and caught another flight to the special occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"no date for postbrexit trade deal says leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Theresa May is well aware that there is zero respect among unionists for Karen Bradley. She is here because she is the Prime Ministers friend and will always be loyal to her.

Mrs Bradleys approach on legacy issues has made her enemies among right-wing backbench MPs. Mrs Bradley was appointed just  months ago amid hopes she would take a more proactive role in restoring devolution than her predecessor.However, the Secretary of State has drawn criticism from across the political ide for failing to take decisions.She was ridiculed for admitting in an interview with House magazine - a weekly Westminster publication - in the summer that she hadnt previously realised elections here were contested along sectarian lines. \"I freely admit that when I started this job, I didnt understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,\" she said.\"I didnt understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists dont vote for unionist parties and vice versa.\"So, the parties fight for election within their own community.\"Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.\"Thats a very dferent world from the world I came from,\" Mrs Bradley said."},{"url":null,"title":"we didnt spend 30 years stopping ira to allow pm and eu to give united ireland by back door says labour mp","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latest battery-only cars need just five minutes at the quickest chargepoints to add  miles to their range, compared with an hour for almost all plug-in hybrids to achieve the same benefit. Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both. Report author Harold Dermott, who has spent more than  years in the motor manufacturing industry, claimed confusion over how fast dferent electric vehicles can be topped up could undermine efforts to provide an adequate public charging network.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

also be imposed on how long people can leave their vehicles in the Upper Square area in a bid to deter all-day parkers.While it is free to park in Castlewellan and there are currently no time

She was told that Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council was considering a proposal to rationalise car parking in the town, and that the council had been renting a car park from Terrace Row Church for a number of years. Part of the rationalisation programme involved considering the termination of this lease.At a committee meeting which took place on  September  Councillor Duddy, a former mayor of Coleraine, declared his interest in respect of the item relating to the church. He then left the room, in compliance with the Code. However, immediately prior to the meeting and at the pre-group party meeting he had asked another councillor to raise issues and ask questions relating to the car park lease.The Commissioner found the action of asking another councillor to ask questions ‘on his behalf’ was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the rules on disclosure and declaration of interest and represented a serious breach of the Code.At a full council meeting on  September, Councillor Duddy did not declare an interest in the church, yet commented on the council’s plans and voted in favour of a proposal to try and extend the car park’s lease. This was in breach of paragraphs . and . of the Code. Although the motion was defeated, Ms Anderson noted that there would have been a signicant financial benefit to the churchit had been agreed.Having refused to attend a second interview with investigators, and not co-operated fully with the investigations into his actions, the Commissioner also found there had been a breach of rule . of the Code.With the Commissioner’s permission, the Deputy Commissioner withdrew allegations of Councillor Duddy’s failure to register his interest in the church.The Commissioner noted the previous good conduct of Councillor Duddy and exemplary public service record, as well as his willingness to learn from the events. However, she stated that these were outweighed by the deliberate nature of the breaches. Given the requirement to uphold public confidence in the conduct of local councillors, and the importance of discouraging similar conduct by others, she believed that a  month suspension was a proportionate sanction.It’s understood Cllr Duddy can appeal to the High Court against the Commissioner’s decision, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act.The News Letter contacted Cllr Duddy, but he said he wasn’t able to make any comment at this time.QC: Jonathan Bell sacriced political career over RHI and is now a social worker Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageN.I. to see snow before Christmas - gale-force winds and heavy rain arriving this weekendO compensation package revealedNI farmer killed by bull: Health and Safety Executive investigatingIN PICTURES: Funeral of murder victim Jim Donegan          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Thinking about the design, I wanted something that symbolised security and protection, and also represented something my neighbours and I had in common. “So I thought of my dear old Alsatian, Clint, who used to guard our house when I was a kid. “Our neighbours were very fond of him, and used to help feed him, so I thought guard dogs would be the perfect theme. “I drew the gates in a Celtic style, with the elongated, elegant dogs’ bodies and sinuous lines of the tails also reflecting some of the style of Art Nouveau.This sculpture is called Master McGrath falls into the frozen River AltJonny works as Arts Assistant for Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council, based at Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, in the beautul, historic location of Moneypenny’s Lock, on the Newry Canal outside Portadown. He reminisced: “When work had finished for the day, I would start work on my gates after hours. “Most of the gates are hand forged in the traditional manner, heating the steel in the forge then shaping it on the anvil, as it has been done for thousands of years. Mayor wishes all a very Merry Christmas Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“The decorative finials , drop bolts, and most of the dogs’ swirling, interlaced bodies are forged this way. For the heads and lower legs, I used more modern techniques such as plasma cutting and grinding to shape the steel. “Then I joined everything together with the MiG welder. To accentuate the eyes, and the dog collars, I added some brass. One of the last details I added was the traditional latch, which is decorated with two matching hand-forged Celtic trisceles representing the dogs’ hearts.”Jonny first started blacksmithing at Tannaghmore Gardens Animal Farm and then at Moneypenny’s since . “As a member of Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, I have had the great privilege of learning from two of the best artist-blacksmiths in the country, Steve Murphy and Aaron Leach. “You can see some of the workshop’s work at Tannaghmore Animal Farm, where we made the entrance gates. We also made the sculptures within the Master McGrath Maze at Tannaghmore. “My piece in the maze – ‘Master McGrath Falling into the Frozen River’ is in a similar style to the ‘Guard Dog Gates’.”Jonny has always had an interest in sculpture since his Art College days in the late s.“I started off carving wood, then, inspired by seeing the Brancusi Museum in Paris, started to carve in stone. In  -  I carved the ‘Human Sundial’ at Oxford Island. “My lelong love of Nature has always inspired my work. Long walks in the country supply both materials and subject matter for my work, which features owls, herons, bulls, cats, dogs etc. “The joy I find in Nature, and in immersing myself in materials from granite and marble to oak and ash, all the way to steel, copper and brass, I try to communicate to the viewer, and to students,” he said.“In recent years, as well as blacksmithing, I have also been teaching Stone Carving in local centres, particularly letter carving. “If you are interested in trying blacksmithing, you can contact Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop on Facebook, or call  .“If you would like to try letter carving in stone, look out for upcoming classes at community centres near you.”If you want to see the gates being made, you can see the whole process on YouTube just search for ‘Stomp Box Jonny guard dog gates’.try catch  TrendingDad leaves sickbed to deliver baby in laybyFatal car crash victim, , is namedRoad closed due to crashPolice angered as thieves target elderly woman in supermarketMumrsquos shock as schoolgirl knocked down in lsquohit and runrsquo incident          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
