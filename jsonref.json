With few exceptions the celebrities brightening our screens favour only the most familiar ingredients: ‘prime’ cuts of meat such as rack of lamb, duck breasts, sirloin steak and so on.Seafood consists invariably of salmon, tiger prawns and cod. How much more useful it would be to show viewers the economic, practical and healthy benefits of cheap cuts, offal and less familiar fish!However, with channels chasing ratings, terrified that the audience will switch off at the sight of a firm, perfectly cooked kidney or a deliciously spiced haggis, it is never going to happen. Cooking shows are entertainment, and no substitute for learning to cook from a parent.         Faggots are another genius ‘nose-to-tail’ solution. They are made from pork liver, heart and belly, wrapped in a lacy ‘caul’ of fat (pictured: Faggots with potato mash, peas and gravy)What’s more, we shop differently today from the way we did in the past. Not so long ago, High Street shopkeepers were essential in educating their customers. Traditional butchers chatted to the lady who had popped in for lamb chops but went out, after a bit of advice, with some cheaper and much more delicious lamb neck instead. This was an essential service — and it was free.New mothers, the elderly, a single person moving into their first home — all could learn from their friendly butcher, fishmonger or greengrocer.Instead, nowadays, we trudge silently with our trolley around the supermarket aisles.Largely as a result of the supermarkets’ influence, our high streets lack the variety they used to display. And hard-working supermarket staff don’t have the time to offer cooking advice.         New mothers, the elderly, a single person moving into their first home — all could learn from their friendly butcher, fishmonger or greengrocer (pictured: Jellied eels)Supermarkets are the culprit in another way. Their model is built on centralised supply: every branch, from Cumbria to Cornwall, sells the same food, often from the same warehouse. Typically, they have little or no local buying policy and put great emphasis on imported produce and novelty. By doing so they have done much to destroy Britain’s richly historical regional food culture.Many of the items on the bottom tier of the survey were specialities of particular areas. Jellied eels became one of the best-loved dishes of London’s East End because the Thames was full of them.Passion for cheap, nourishing jellied eels is embedded in the Cockney mindset, though it is disappearing fast.Haggis is a fine example of how canny cooks invented ways to use all of an animal, in this case the sheep. Chopped, seasoned and sealed inside the animal’s stomach as a homemade sausage — perfect for boiling! — it symbolises 500 years of croft farming and is justly beloved of the Scots.Faggots are another genius ‘nose-to-tail’ solution. They are made from pork liver, heart and belly, wrapped in a lacy ‘caul’ of fat, and were once a favourite supper wherever you found pigs: the South-West, the Midlands and Yorkshire.         Liver was sliced thinly, then flash-fried in butter. Tender and a little pink in the middle, it was beautifully complemented by crisp bacon and smooth, buttery mashed potato (pictured: Liver and onions)Enthusiasm for faggots — the name doesn’t help — has been dwindling for decades in spite of the meat industry’s best efforts. In the Seventies, a campaign ran with a slogan that would probably not be used today: ‘Surprise your husband with a faggot.’It might be idealistic to suggest that everyone can be persuaded to try food made with blood, guts and heaven knows what else.While travelling, I have wimped out of challenging delicacies. In the Faroe Islands, I was proudly served fermented mutton, a die-hard speciality if ever there was one. I could still taste it three days later — but the Faroese, who eat it as infants, love it.A parent who wants their child to enjoy everything can be forgiven for cheating: I fed our daughter black pudding from a very young age without telling her what it was. She loved its rich crumbliness, crisp edges and herby seasoning.When she was about 12, she asked me what it was made from. Her face fell for a moment when I told her, then swiftly recovered.Delicious won the battle — and if she one day feeds black pudding to her children, perhaps that food will start to rise again to its rightful place in the pantheon of great British dishes."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/06/13/16/4ACC9E9200000578-0-image-m-59_1560440406564.jpg","title":"Stop calling Jeremy C says Jeremy Hunt series air gaffes presenters","story":"Share this articleGrow up and stop calling me the c-word live on air, Jeremy Hunt tells broadcasters"},{"url":null,"title":"Four five Ofsted rated outstanding schools downgraded inspected year","story":"Share this article However, it proves parents should in future be suspicious of outstanding-rated schools which have not been inspected for a number of years.The reason why Ofsted does not routinely inspect outstanding-rated schools is a government-imposed exception aimed at letting them \u0027get on with their good work\u0027.

He then told me his story:I was not a soldier before I used to work for an international NGO de-mining company trying to rid the country of landmines. One day I was de-mining when one blew off my arms – a mine that had been planted by the Taliban. It was then that I decided to join up with the Northern Alliance and learned to shoot an AK-47 with my new arms so I could take revenge.For me photography has always been about having fun and there’s no better enjoyment then street photography. I have been going to Havana for many years now and it was and still is one of the best places in the world for street photography. The old-world charm of Cuba oozes through every crack and along every street corner. Also in public view are most people’s interiors. When you’re walking along the street you’re watching out for any moment outdoors but you are also drawn into the more private spaces as well. I saw this woman sitting just as she was from the street looking in. I stopped in my tracks and thought, should I? I walked to the door and through my very broken Spanish I asked if I could take her photograph. She said yes. The lighting was perfect, the setting incredible, everything was there for the taking. You don’t take photographs, you’re given them. Photography is a gift.Aside from Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea is the one country I have travelled in and photographed most. I had been inspired to go by the films by friend and colleague Bob Connolly and late-night stories from Mark Worth who sadly passed away some years ago. This photograph was taken on my first trip to PNG at an annual cultural festival in the Western Highlands capital Mount Hagen. I paid some locals to build me a makeshift grass hut studio and I invited sitters to be photographed.I was in Srinagar working on a story around war trauma. Kashmir is one of the world’s longest-running conflicts that dates back to the British partition of India and Pakistan. I wanted to look at the consequences of human suffering from the Indian side of Kashmir. I’d already been to the Pakistan side a year earlier. I covered the weekly protests, mainly young Muslim youths against Indian soldiers. Very similar to what I’d witnessed on many occasions in Israel and Palestine, a kind of David v Goliath scenario. I received a minor injury when an Indian soldier shot a stun grenade directly at me and it hit the top of my foot. I photographed them dragging off protestors into trucks. At some point I found myself inside the main psychiatric hospital. I had a really good fixer who got me in and I worked frantically knowing that my access was unique and that I would be tossed out or worse at any time. It was visually strong and many of the patients were in there because of the effects of war.For me a good war photograph must be an anti-war photograph. War is a nasty business and traumatises both the killers and the victims. While embedded with the US marines in Kunar province in 2005 I was out on a routine patrol with them as they searched for insurgents or weapons caches. I noticed that the marine in front of me stopped at the corner of a mud wall, trigger ready. As I framed my picture I could see an incredibly intense gaze from a young boy with other gazes and interesting compositions spilling the frame. For me this young boy summed up an entire nation’s feeling towards a foreign occupation. War also makes the youth fearless.Lately I have been digging through my archive looking for broken frames. These are photographs that have been unintentionally messed up, double exposed, light or emulsion leakage and x-ray damaged. This portrait I took of Tim Page is a personal favourite. Tim is a very close friend and I grew up wanting to be a photographer through his words and photographs. He was one of the inspirations for me to cover war. Tim is most famous for his coverage of the Vietnam war and I feel quite blessed not to just know the man but be invited right now to collaborate with him on a kind of retrospective book of his Nam pictures and contact sheets.In 2009 I had the fortune to be an artist in residence with the Sydney festival. A festival highlight was one of my all-time favourite bands Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds who would play Cockatoo Island. As I had an all-access pass, I found Nick Cave and Warren Ellis backstage before one of their gigs. I asked if I could take some portraits and Nick and Warren posed in a back room. After not even finishing a roll of 12 frames, Nick said “I think you got the shot” and they walked away. Happily I did get the shot, thank you Nick, you were right.I was covering the chaos and aftermath from the 1999 East Timorese referendum for independence. Pro-Indonesian militia were roaming streets killing people, soldiers were looting and burning down buildings as they prepared to depart by ships. I was among the first wave of journalists to arrive as the international community sent in foreign forces to bring stability and peace to the world’s newest nation. I flew in with the British on C130 Hercules and was met with total chaos throughout the city. Most folks had fled the city before we arrived and were still hiding in the nearby jungles. But slowly they returned as more and more foreign soldiers arrived, many from Australia. I took this photograph as a man was pushing a cart with a child inside of it and passed a former Indonesian military barracks that was on fire. I liked the caged symbolism of the child against the inferno-esque backdrop. I remember thinking it reminded me of scenes I had often seen from photographs taken in Cambodia during the genocide there.I can never forget this photograph because soon after I took the frame I was mugged. I was in Bucharest shooting a story around stray dogs (there were 300,000 in the city alone). Whenever I go to a new city I like to walk around and get a feel for the place and shoot street pictures. It was mid winter, snowing with that eastern European grey tinge to the place, when suddenly I was cornered by four men in trenchcoats. I had my Leica around my neck and my Hasselblad Xpan over my shoulder, maybe even a Rolleiflex as well. They asked for my wallet, took out all my cash and handed it back to me before moving on. All I could think about at that moment was what I was prepared to do if they went for my cameras. It was not even so much the cameras but the unexposed rolls of film I had inside them that I would have done pretty much any crazy thing to keep. I knew I had some great pictures and that is all my mind was focused on. I practically threw my wallet at them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e408beb31307f7062750642598e14884f4923f19/0_0_3540_2459/master/3540.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b63665bbe79c320f7ad1eedeeef260 480w","title":"observer new review summer book clinic send us your questions","story":"Heading on holiday but no idea what to read?

They will now be required to stay sober throughout the working day.LME members’ drink-fuelled lunches have been detailed by Farage, who worked at the exchange after leaving school and counted among his favourite City haunts the Lamb pub in Leadenhall Market.The move comes months after the LME issued its first ever code of conduct, after coming under fire for hosting a cocktail party at the Playboy Club in Mayfair. The code stresses that drinking at LME-branded or third party events should be in “moderation”, and that events should not be held at venues that make some members uncomfortable.Men make up the majority of the exchange’s floor traders.An LME spokeswoman said: “The LME has broad powers under its rulebook to ensure fit and proper behaviour on the ‘ring and ring’ dealing, and members have policies and procedures in place regarding the behaviour of their staff while conducting business on the ring.“The LME appreciates the high standards upheld by its members, and has formalised the general position that ring-based personnel should not consume any alcohol prior to conducting business.”The exchange has not given details details of how it will punish those who flout the rules.It is understood the ban has been introduced partly because of a recent surge in trading, which has raised concerns that investor cash could be put at risk by drink.The tougher rules on alcohol consumption are also part of a wider crackdown on unsavoury behaviour across the City, which is trying to shed its reputation as a boys’ club.The insurance market Lloyd’s of London made headlines in 2017 for similarly banning its 800 direct employees from drinking during working hours.This year the ban was extended people believed to be under the influence of drink or drugs are barred from entering the building. About 40,000 people have passes to Lloyd’s, which also pledged to turn its on-site bar into a coffee shop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe06368c47c4523c9ba344f47097d4e4d7a979eb/6_30_4644_2786/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c25191f414eeebab7ed3df80207cb863","title":"the us economic recovery is far from being a world record","story":"It uses different rules to other countries to measure business cycles and recessionsThis month marks the tenth full year of the US economic recovery that began in June 2009. Back then, a “trough” in business activity signified the end of the Great Recession that followed the 2007-8 global financial crisis. The current expansion has continued, uninterrupted, ever since.The best explanation for the length of this recovery is disappointingly simple: the Great Recession was the United States’ worst downturn since the 1930s. The deeper the hole, the longer it takes to climb out. Yet the prolonged US expansion also highlights some important issues regarding how countries measure business cycles and economic slumps.For starters, the 10-year milestone is especially noteworthy. Assuming that the US is not unknowingly already in a new recession, the current recovery is tied with the decade-long expansion from March 1991 to March 2001 for the longest on record. (Records of US troughs and peaks go back to 1854.)This US expansion, however, is far from being a world record. That honour goes to Australia, where the unbroken recovery that began in mid-1991 will soon complete its 28th year.Australia and most other countries date their economic expansions using the rule that defines a recession as two or more consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The US is almost alone in using a less mechanical process that includes employment and a variety of other economic indicators, in addition to the core criterion of GDP. (Japan’s government also departs from the automatic two-quarter rule and considers other indicators.)Troughs and peaks in the US economy are dated by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). (I am a member of this committee but I do not speak for it and I am writing here in a personal capacity.) The NBER’s dates are regarded as official: the US commerce department and other government agencies rely on them in their reporting and analysis of economic data.The choice of method for dating business cycles can make a significant difference. The Italian economy, for example, has experienced several separate recessions since 2008 according to the standard two-quarter rule, but one long recession if one applies a more common-sense approach.Clearly, the two-quarter rule has both pros and cons compared to the NBER committee’s less mechanical approach. One advantage is that it appears more objective. Another is that the public learns of a cyclical turning point with a lag of only a few months – that is, as quickly as the GDP statistics are compiled. The NBER, by contrast, typically waits a year or longer after the fact, until all the data are in, before announcing a turning point. Its announcements are then duly ridiculed for their long lag.One major disadvantage of the two-quarter rule, however, is that GDP statistics are usually revised subsequently, which may require a retroactive revision of the cyclical turning points. For example, a 2011-12 recession in the UK was subsequently erased from the record when the GDP numbers were revised in June 2013. The reason the NBER waits so long before dating a trough or peak is so that it can be reasonably sure it will not have to revise the call in the future. Likewise, the Japanese government waits for a year or so before making such announcements.There is another, more fundamental reason for abandoning the two-quarter rule. Some countries experience sharp slowdowns or periods of diminished economic activity and yet their long-term trend growth rates are either so high or so low that the negative-growth rule does not capture what is needed to describe the state of the economy.Now consider the opposite problem, when the two-quarter rule yields infrequent recessions. To be sure, much of Australia’s success can be attributed to its adoption of structural reforms since the 1980s, its openness to trade and a switch to a floating exchange rate. Still, one reason why Australia’s GDP shows no downturns in the past 28 years is that the country’s population and labour force are growing substantially faster than those in the US and other advanced economies, especially in Europe and East Asia.Assuming the current US expansion continues in July, it will break the record of 10 years set in 1991-2001. But if the dates of American business cycles were determined by the rule that most other countries apply, the US recession of March to November 2001 would be erased. (It did not include two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth but rather two negative quarters separated by a positive one.) Under that interpretation, the US record, it seems, would instead be the 17-year expansion from the first quarter of 1991 to the fourth quarter of 2007. And the current recovery would still have a long way to go to top that.• Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.

Business can have no absolute reassurance that an agreement will be reached, particularly given the commitment of some Conservative leadership candidates to leaving the EU in October, with or without a deal. It feels like the extension is at risk of being wasted.”The IoD said there had been very limited financial support from central government for small businesses to prepare, despite repeated calls from the employers’ group for Brexit planning vouchers to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receive professional help for complex trade and legal issues.Morgan said that getting a deal would be “by some distance” the better outcome, adding that it would prolong the uncertainty if Britain had to trade with the EU on the same World Trade Organization terms as countries such as China and the US.“If businesses can’t have faith in politicians that means they have to look out for themselves. With business costs rising in many quarters, and management time precious, it’s understandable that firms don’t want to put resources towards preparing for something we still hope won’t happen. But the risk of no deal is very real and so we’d urge all businesses, if they haven’t done so already, to carefully consider their exposure and draw up mitigation plans now.”Speaking on Thursday, Tesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, said it was harder for supermarkets to prepare for a no-deal exit from the EU in October than it was in March because they will be storing more products for Halloween and Christmas in their warehouses, leaving limited space for Brexit stockpiles. “October will be much more challenging than March was,” Lewis said. “We’ll be coming out of Halloween and building stock for the Christmas peak, so the capacity in the supply chain will be much more challenging. It’s about sheer physical capacity. It’s not just the availability – it’ll be the space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639de100e94f2b15df49dce3015e48959d4303a2/0_464_7846_4708/master/7846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=407e492cb1af1299f9f274a00240d5b6","title":"has tokyo reached peak city","story":"You could argue that the world’s biggest city has hit a sweet spot: a flatlining population, pervasive transit and little gentrification. But is ‘peak city’ even possible – and where does Tokyo go from here?Tokyo is often described as crowded, mushrooming, figuratively bursting at the seams. Except, in many ways, it’s not.Unlike many megacities, the world’s largest metropolitan area has largely stopped growing, either in land or population. Where Mumbai, Lagos or São Paulo continually sprout new informal neighbourhoods that are constantly outstripping the ability of the city to catch up, Tokyo’s urban planning and services more or less seamlessly encompass the central wards and the neighbouring cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Chiba and Saitama that form its unbroken metropolitan area.Despite Japan’s ageing population, Tokyo’s demographics are actually quite middle of the road. Far from being crammed with people, Tokyo is in fact averagely dense – more crowded than some cities, less so than others.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownUnemployment and crime are low. Traffic is comparatively well-managed, while the modal share of transit and cycling are high: Tokyo in particular has solved what many cities call the “last-mile” transit problem, by relying on an informal network of cheap bicycles. Gentrification, though a factor, feels less disruptive than in similarly prosperous cities such as London and New York, where entire neighbourhoods are being rewritten at great speed, or most Chinese cities, which are unrecognisable to themselves 15 years ago.Of course, Tokyo has many problems. Its real estate remains expensive, its sprawl makes for long commute times, it has less green space per capita than one might hope for, and worrying social problems remain. Nor has Tokyo stopped changing: because real estate value is tied so closely to land rather than property, new buildings rarely last longer than 30 years, leading to a constant shedding of the city’s skin.But is there an argument to be made that Tokyo, having now finished its postwar growth spurt, has reached a kind of maturity? Is this the most stable form of megacity that can exist at present – occupying an equilibrium where the population is stable, change is manageable, and the city’s residents and industries are in some sort of balance?While the cities of Kinshasa and Delhi continue to grow apace, and the Chinese government has actively restricted the growth of Shanghai and Beijing, Tokyo’s population has evened out – in part because it has more or less run out of new land to cover, and in part because of the ageing population of Japan.“Tokyo is the first megacity to see the end of growth,” says Andre Sorensen, chair of the department of human geography at the University of Toronto, whose 2002 book The Making of Urban Japan was widely praised as key to understanding Japanese urban planning. “It offers important lessons for cities around the world, as ‘peak urban’ will increasingly be seen elsewhere over the rest of this century as the world becomes fully urban and population growth slows and then starts to decline.”“The bell curve of the population age will be 50-60, and the city will contract and become more concentrated,” agrees Mark Dytham of Klein Dytham Architects. “The bulk will slowly evaporate leaving a stronger essence of the city and I think in the next 20 years in 2040 you are going to see the city stop contracting as birth rate levels out.”Although immigration is increasing, it remains a relative drop in the bucket.“Tokyo is clearly at or near its peak population, at the high point of the rollercoaster ride, the point when the distant horizon comes into view, just before the nose points down, gravity takes charge, and downward acceleration begins,” Sorensen says. “Although few demographers are willing to say so, it is hard to imagine the factors sufficient to end this decline.”One clear benefit of this “peak” is that housing prices have levelled out, more than two decades after the burst of the asset bubble in 1991. This allowed, says Sorensen, “an extraordinary burst of high-rise residential development in the core of the city over the last 15 years, in part because lower land prices made it economically viable to build new condominiums in central areas.”Unfortunately, Tokyo is also sucking up people and resources from the regions. “The construction of housing in the Tokyo core just means that many more vacant dwellings in the suburbs and the rest of Japan. And housing vacancy and abandonment is already an epidemic of vast proportions, particularly in declining regions, but already also in the Tokyo suburbs.”That’s a huge problem, agrees Tom Gill, professor of social anthropology at Meiji Gakuin University in Tokyo, who specialises in Japanese social issues, especially casual labour, poverty, homelessness and minority issues. For one thing, Gill says, it robs the regions of youth and hurts industries such as agriculture and fisheries. The government’s latest effort to increase immigration is in large part aimed at reviving those creaking industries, as  Cities reported earlier this week. “This is a gigantic socioeconomic problem, and one that successive governments have signally failed to address.” Unlike some countries where governments attempt to offset the centrality of a single dominant city by spreading services to smaller cities, in Japan most officialdom is centred in Tokyo. “There has been plenty of talk about devolution and decentralisation, but no action,” Gill says.The dominance of Tokyo hurts the regions in other ways. This week, the  reported on how the 2020 Olympics projects have sucked up construction labour and driven up the price of raw materials, hugely slowing the reconstruction of the lands that were destroyed by the 2011 tsunami.“The Tokyo Olympics have adversely impacted the ongoing struggles of local communities in the quake-tsunami-meltdown stricken north-east,” agrees Franz Prichard, assistant professor at the Department of East Asian Studies of Princeton University and author of Residual Futures, a book about Japanese cultural responses to urbanisation in the 1960s and 70s. He argues that this can “complicate the myth of recovery” from which Tokyo currently benefits. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is currently pushing the narrative that the nuclear disaster is “under control”, as Japan attempts to resume selling nuclear plants abroad.“The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster was symbolic,” agrees Gill. “The crippled reactors were located in rural Fukushima, but the electricity they generated went straight to Tokyo. This was a particularly striking example of the regions being sacrificed for the benefit of the metropolis.”But the availability of relatively affordable housing in the centre of the city does mean that there is less concern with a huge issue transforming other developed-world capitals, such as London and New York: gentrification.And it’s not just because of newbuild construction, says the architect and urban theorist Hiroshi Ota. Because Japanese real estate values land over property, it is often the case that the smallest houses are in fact the most valuable.From a rooftop in Aoyama, he points out the low clusters of single-family homes.“Those are probably richer people than the people living in the tower blocks,” he says. “And they won’t leave. They don’t sell.“It’s also hard for commercial property developers to buy them out and knock them down, because the lots are so small, and neighbours often refuse to sell in groups. And for many unused plots of land, nobody knows who the owner is at all – it’s some distant family relation who might not even know they’re the owner, or they’re all dead.” Major developments like Roppongi Hills required large parcels of land that were already in one set of hands, and that’s a rarity.Nevertheless, there has been gentrification in the sense that young families have been pushed out from the core by lack of services. Tom Gill notes that a short walk from Shibuya or Shinjuku, you will see little parks with no children playing on the swings and slides. “In fact, right in the centre of Tokyo, many of the primary schools closed down many years ago, as rising housing prices forced people out of the city centre, where residential districts were taken over by high-rise office buildings.”The suburbs have taken on a lot of the social problems the city centre no longer has to deal with. “As your own paper pointed out just yesterday, suburban housing projects have become ghettoes for the old,” he says. “Not much violence in the streets — but how about the solitary old people dying alone (kodokushi) in their apartments, their bodies often not discovered until they start decomposing and smelling? Is that what happens in a peak city?”The city’s transit system is the envy of the world: dozens of private metro and public rail lines run impeccable service across nearly the entirety of the metropolitan region. “Despite its size it has developed an articulated metropolitan governance system that responds to its specific economic, environmental and social challenges with one of the most sophisticated and efficient integrated public transport system in the world,” declared a report by the LSE Urban Age programme.Cycle-share systems haven’t made huge inroads into Tokyo, but only because so many people already have bikes of their own, which can be parked in large automated lots at most key stations, solving the vaunted “last-mile” problem between home and public transport that bedevils many cities. Commuting full distances on bikes, however, is not encouraged in Tokyo the network of blue arrows painted on the streets for bike routes ahead of the Olympics is frequently interrupted by delivery vehicles, and seems basically token in nature.Bicycles could be better integrated into the city, argues Astrid Klein of Klein Dytham. “But we just love the seamless integration of cars, bikes and people in the smaller streets – a fuzzy soft logic. It’s no good having beautiful streets – say, the Victorian terraces of Chelsea in London – if you then allow cars to be double parked in front of them. In Japan there is no on-road parking, which keeps the roads free of ugly cars and allows pavements to be free.”Sorensen points out that there is a danger of ascribing Japan’s much-vaunted social stability to something inherent in Japanese culture, as opposed to wealth. It could also mean ignoring the marginalised groups that aren’t easily heard in a consensus-driven society, says Prichard.“On the one hand, relative to other cities, Tokyo is in fact quite remarkable, the essential support networks of a liberal welfare state remain operative and have so far survived the neoliberal plunder seen in other cities in ‘advanced’ states. But without the tireless struggles of many people this would not have been the case,” he said.“Discovering the forces at play in sustaining the benefits of this stability would include telling the stories of those who worked to make the state accountable to the people, including the erse histories of the movements for gender equality, resident Korean rights movements, environmental movements, anti-hate speech movements, labour movements, and many more.”Despite the wonders of the transit system, Tokyo also remains a massive city with difficult commutes, and a demanding work culture. “There are plenty of people enduring four or five hours on a severely overcrowded train each day as they struggle to get between their workplace and their in one of the far-flung suburbs,” says Gill. “Flextime? Working from home? These practices have been around for half a century, but very few major Japanese employers make use of them. So the misery of the daily commute continues.”Regardless of whether it’s useful to speak of Tokyo as a “peak city”, everyone agrees on one thing: change is inevitable.“The dominant features of the version of Tokyo we have now are only a few decades old. So the stasis and stability we perceive is only legible from a narrowed time-frame,” says Prichard.Tokyo is, like all cities, subject to external forces: “While Tokyo is exceptional in many ways, it is also deeply connected to other cities (and non-cities) in Japan and worldwide. Despite the best efforts of planners and politicians, the forces at play in the conditions favourable to this narrowly framed stability are by no means under control. The flux of regional and global flows of ideas, goods, and people, as well as the uncalculated human and environmental costs of this fraught equilibrium, remain to be determined.”Sorensen, too, emphasises the importance of understanding 2019 Tokyo as a snapshot of a particular moment in time. “The basic problem of the suggestion that Tokyo’s current housing affordability (compared to comparable cities like New York, Mumbai, London, Shanghai and Paris) represents a sweet spot of ‘stability and equilibrium’ is that this is a snapshot view that is devoid of historical perspective,” he said.“Cities always exist in time, and temporal processes and future expectations rule in property markets. This equilibrium seems to me a temporary and passing moment. Use value triumphs over exchange value, but asset values evaporate. How this will play out is unknown, and it will be worth watching this space. But celebrating this moment as an enviable period of balance seems a bit myopic.”“I do not feel comfortable calling Tokyo a peak city,” agrees Gill. “It is a very complex situation, and there are some positive aspects, notably the fact that it is now relatively inexpensive to live in Tokyo, certainly less expensive than London, and there’s no denying the low crime rate and feeling of safety when walking through Tokyo at night.

Announcing his third defection in four months, Umunna last night posed alongside Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, whom he once astutely declared “can’t run away from his record as part of the Tory-led government or try to pretend Tory policies have nothing to do with the Lib Dems”. Just two years ago, he bitterly declared he “can’t forgive” what the Lib Dems have “done to my area” indeed that he “could never countenance suggesting voters support Liberal Democratic or Conservative candidates on account of their Remain credentials – this would require turning a blind eye to the cuts to our local schools, the NHS and other public services instigated by both parties in government from 2010 to 2015”.Everyone is entitled to shift their opinions: as John Maynard Keynes once put it, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” But what facts have changed about the Lib Dems since 2017? Both Cable and Jo Swinson, the frontrunner to replace him as leader, are unrepentant about the austerity they imposed on the country, and which Umunna all too recently passionately condemned them for. It gets better. At the end of April, a leaked document from Umunna’s Change UK revealed his then-party’s plans to wipe out the Lib Dems as an electoral force. Umunna has gone from seeking to politically extinguish a party to becoming its enthusiastic parliamentary representative in the course of seven weeks.When Umunna and his motley crew launched their burning skip of a political party, they relentlessly declared that “politics is broken”. Let me gently suggest that if this is indeed true, Umunna should cast his gaze at the nearest mirror (not something I imagine he is averse to doing anyway).I first came across Umunna in 2008 when I was working in the parliamentary office of a then little-known leftwing backbencher by the name of John McDonnell. His head of operations, Simeon Andrews, a lifelong socialist with a penchant for goth metal who sadly died last year, stood as the left candidate to be Labour’s representative in Streatham. Along with Andrew Fisher, now Labour’s head of policy, I helped run his campaign, sadly doomed in an era during which the Labour left was virtually extinct. The right’s candidate was Steve Reed, now a shadow minister, while Umunna stood as a “soft left” candidate, dedicated to opposing Trident and New Labour’s policies.But as soon as he was elected, he shifted rightwards, disassociating himself from the soft left Compass group he was once a figurehead for. Appointed shadow business secretary, he embraced comparisons with Blairite icon Peter Mandelson by 2013, his political trajectory led one senior left-leaning Labour figure to somewhat harshly tell me privately that “Ed Miliband has helped create a monster”.If politics is indeed broken, it’s because there are too many politicians who believe in little other than themselves: Boris Johnson is certainly a striking example of this tribe, but so too is Chuka Umunna. He claims that taking the risky leap out of one of the established parties absolves him of the charge of “careerism”. But in truth, it was driven by the arrogance of a man who once derided West End clubbers as “trash” a man whose ego, easily flattered by sympathetic journalists and parliamentarians, convinced him that he really was Britain’s Macron, that his charisma and popularity would propel a new political formation to dazzling success.Now his vanity has collided with political reality, and to survive he has leapt into the arms of a party he recently sought to destroy. But however comforting the Lib Dems’ recent surge may be, it is shallow: its brand of politics has no purchase outside of Brexit – walk around your town centre and you’ll find punters can’t name a single Lib Dem policy other than a second referendum. It will, in time, come crashing down to earth, and bring Umunna with it.In the meantime, enough of this farce. Umunna was elected to parliament wearing a Labour rosette, on the back of a Labour manifesto, just two years ago. When the Change UK European parliamentary candidate David Macdonald defected to the Lib Dems a month ago, Umunna said it was “disappointing that this candidate has chosen to pledge allegiance to another party – he has let down his fellow candidates and activists”. The same goes for a man who, in part, owes his parliamentary salary to the Labour activists who sacrificed their precious time pounding streets, knocking on doors, and delivering leaflets to get him elected. Umunna is now in his third party within four months and, rather than insulting the voters who opted for a Labour candidate, he should go back to the people and give them a final say. That he won’t is both cowardice and hypocrisy – and is exactly why Umunna is so emblematic of our broken politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21e5f2cdcac00c4bd5fe1db13d4646a75691b0fb/0_389_2214_1328/master/2214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db0ee6d718a96f3ed2eb3aeab95034c","title":"coffee finance experts","story":"I get notifications on my phone whenever I use my bank card and this week, while undertaking a mini-audit, I noted that I was doing something that apparently leads to financial ruin. The other morning, in a bakery on Broadway, I spent $8.70 on non-essential pastries. A few hours later, in spite of the loaf of bread in my house, I threw down $8.25 at Pick A Bagel. And scattered throughout the day, like small distress flares sent up from my current account, was a notification trail of $3.77 coffees.It’s not the first time a wealthy investment analyst has characterised coffee drinking as feckless spending. A few years ago, Shark Tank judge, billionaire wealth manager and nightmare human being Kevin O’Leary told CNBC: “Do I pay $2.50 for a coffee? Never, never, never do I do that. That is such a waste of money for something that costs 20 cents. I never buy a frappe-latte-blah-blah-blah-woof-woof-woof for $2.50.” Instead, he said, he drank coffee at home and invested the difference, as a way of “maintaining growth in my own personal investing”.Most of us understand this to be a narrow definition of personal investing. You definitely don’t need that coffee. Nor do you need brunch of any kind, ever. You don’t need to go to the movies when there’s TV at home, and why have kids when you could maintain growth in your personal investing by putting the money in a Roth IRA instead? The gimlet-eyed joylessness of an old age spent reliving all the wonderful ways in which you saved money is certainly one to look forward to. O, reason not the need.On the other hand, I’ve always liked Orman and quite admire her for doing the maths on this. In other circumstances, most of us would not, probably, reserve a whole lot of love for Starbucks and might even admit the chain is bleeding us dry. For all that Orman and O’Leary are advocating self-denial in the pursuit of making more money, the puritan in me quite likes their jabs at consumerist spending. Iced coffee season is upon us in New York and the sheer volume of people wandering around sucking on straws like pacifiers is a reminder of just how bananas many of us are, nursing an apparently constant need to be consuming all day. I went to a meeting on Tuesday and although I was running late, I swerved into a coffee shop on the way because for some atavistic reason that might once have been fixed by smoking, I wanted the security blanket of a large, sweating cup in my hand. It was a nervous tic, and not a particularly good one.It’s not the money I resent, although there is that. It’s the consumption as blind reflex and the equation of that reflex with comfort. No matter how unpalatable the source of the advice, it might be a good idea to take another look at the habit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8323aeaa2f6cf9bb8677f5c28fb9ba950eab4e/0_0_2342_1405/master/2342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ecd970b59be23786904c1bdcac6fd9a","title":"mainstream pride flag queer people paris is burning","story":"The mainstream loves to fly the Pride flag, but being subsumed by the dominant culture can leave LGBTQ+ people open to exploitation“In a ballroom, you can be anything you want – you’re not really an executive, but you’re looking like an executive, and therefore you are showing the straight world that I can be an executive. If I had the opportunity, I would be one. And that is like a fulfilment.”These words were spoken by the New York drag queen Dorian Corey, as documented in Jennie Livingston’s landmark Paris Is Burning (1990). The documentary – this week re-released in New York cinemas and now available on Netflix – charts the subcultural “ballroom” scene of mid-to-late 1980s Harlem, where LGBTQ+ black and Latinx people competed in runway battles and Voguing dance-offs. The thriving community is also the subject of Ryan Murphy’s acclaimed FX-series Pose, currently available on BBC iPlayer.Corey’s quote relates to an aspect of ballroom history I’ve long been fascinated with: that of “realness”. As part of their pageantry, ballgoers would compete at imitating the most conventional images of white America categories ranged from “corporate executive” and “military general” to “high-fashion winter sportswear” and “going to college realness”. In this counter-cultural space designed exclusively for LGBTQ+ people of colour – most from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds – was an intent to wear the costumes of the country that denounced them. Debate still rages today about the way mainstream institutions appropriate LGBTQ+ culture – you’ll be hard pressed to find a brand that doesn’t flash a rainbow logo this Pride month – but what happens when LGBTQ+ communities instead steal from the mainstream? And what does this tell us about the relationships LGBTQ+ people have with the dominant culture?For decades, queer artists have manipulated the language and imagery of heteronormative society. Drag’s rich history of lip-syncing is a vivid example. Many LGBTQ+ people can recall that first spine-tingling moment in a nightclub when they became hypnotised by a drag queen mouthing the words to their favourite song – and in doing so giving it a whole new meaning. For me it was a queen in New York, who transformed Whitney Houston’s club banger I Wanna Dance With Somebody into a gut-punching cry for intimacy after lifelong familial rejection.There’s something immediately galvanising in seeing a queer person steal a product from dominant culture, only to empty it out and replace its original connotations with ones that resonate with their community. In a way, drag performers are to pop culture what Robin Hood is to the financial elite. And even if a performance isn’t explicitly political, the mere act of watching a queenking lip-sync to a song originally designed for the masses can inspire hope. As LGBTQ+ people, systemic prejudices mean we implicitly feel unwelcome inside mainstream culture there’s a sense of triumph in watching ourselves assume the culture that discounted us, and on our own terms.This cold war between mainstream and counter-culture was at the heart of Andy Warhol’s work: he had to adopt survival strategies as a gay artist in the US of the 1950s and 60s. His ambition was to create spaces within an institutionally homophobic mainstream in which queer people could feel represented. Take the infamous Marilyn screen prints, where Warhol borrows the newspaper photograph of a female celebrity designed for straight male pleasure, only to colourfully distort it so she’s less a screen siren and more a drag icon. Warhol recycles a widely popular image, smuggling something back into mass culture with which LGBTQ+ people across the US might have a greater affinity.But when does this strategy shift from political subversion to assimilation? For this is the inevitable tragedy running through Paris Is Burning. Although “realness” is by nature irreverent with heteronormative norms, it’s also undeniable that many who practise it are desperate for mainstream America’s stamp of approval. Within the balls, the more “realistically” gender-nonconforming bodies of colour can pass as corporate executives, the more trophies they win (literally). It’s a bit like that bittersweet thrill many gay people confess to when someone says, “Oh, I thought you were straight!” The sad paradox is that LGBTQ+ people have suffered so much exclusion – whether by family, faith, or society – that we’re often willing to accept any form of validation from the very institution that excluded us. By the end of the documentary, this tension plays out when a black trans woman admits that despite finding refuge in ballroom culture, all she really wants is “to live a normal, happy life. Whether it’s being married and adopting children. Whether it’s being famous and rich … I want so much more.”As a queer person who has suffered a great deal of familial rejection, I know how seductive any kind of inclusion can feel. When you’ve not had much, even crumbs of acceptance feel like a lot. It’s partly why our community is so susceptible to being co-opted and commodified. So a message to all institutions pouncing on us this Pride – just because we’re vulnerable, it doesn’t mean we can’t see what you’re doing. To the Home Office: stop flying our flag while you deport LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. To the NSPCC: don’t boast our colours while you give in to transphobia. To Topshop: don’t parade our filter while you remove trans people from changing rooms. If you’re all going to steal our rainbow, we deserve more than your crumbs.• Amrou Al-Kadhi is a British-Iraqi writer, drag performer and filmmaker.

Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9519285b5a563bb373699a7b2ba296f5a0cafa6/0_0_2830_1699/master/2830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70d264b3c32eef42169dc5fd02a9508d","title":"power to the people how spanish cities took control of energy","story":"The ‘sunshine tax’ is dead, and Barcelona and Cádiz are mounting a renewables revivalAfter a close fight, Barcelona’s radical mayor, Ada Colau, is expected to take office for a second term on Saturday, vindicating her often-criticised policies, which have included making sure all the city’s municipal buildings and services run on renewable energy.On the other side of the country in Andalucía, José María González was re-elected as mayor of Cádiz last month having swept to power in 2015 on the same tide that brought Colau to office, with energy as a central issue in his campaign.Cádiz and Barcelona have set themselves up as distributors, cutting out the middle man, and have begun installing solar panels on public buildings with the aim of becoming self-sufficient.“Energy policy should be in the hands of the people,” González said. “In Cádiz we set up two permanent citizens’ energy forums and the people have been the driving force behind the improvements we have carried out. The people of Cádiz are the motor of energy transition.”Cádiz is an ancient city but its elegant squares obscure the fact that it is the poorest province in Andalucía, Spain’s poorest region, and one of the most impoverished in the European Union. A quarter of the city’s population are unemployed.Under González, €500,000 (£445,000) of the profits generated by Eléctrica de Cádiz is used to prevent “energy poverty” among the city’s most disadvantaged, whereas other companies simply cut off the supply to those who cannot afford to pay.“The profits are invested in Cádiz, they don’t go to Qatar or a tax haven,” he said.González believes the city’s sustainable policies were a factor in attracting the electric vehicle producer Torrot to establish its factory in Cádiz, with the creation of 200 jobs. In a city where shipbuilding dates back to Phoenician times, the shipyards have also ersified into building offshore wind platforms.In wealthy Catalonia, Barcelona has also taken energy matters into its hands. When the power company that supplied the city failed to bid to renew its €33m contract last year, the council decided to set up Barcelona Energia (BE), to buy certified renewable energy direct from source.“Our aims as a public company are to promote renewables and an ecological transition,” said Eloi Badia, responsible for the city’s energy policy. “We’re not looking to make a profit, and as a public service we can’t subsidise electricity because that would be unfair competition, but we can offer people a range of tariffs and, in the case of the most vulnerable, we can help directly and bypass welfare benefits and the like.”However, as most people in the city live in apartment blocks, the issue is more complicated than installing solar panels on the roof of a house. Most blocks house a mix of owner-occupiers and tenants and Badia said there was as yet no legal framework for people living in apartments to share energy generated from communal solar panels.“We’re doing it in phases, learning as we go along,” he said. “We’re not in a hurry, we’ve only been going since last July and only supplying homes since January.”Spain was on the way to becoming a world leader in renewables until the big power companies, alarmed that self-generation would cost them clients, persuaded the conservative government to introduce the so-called “sunshine tax” in 2013. Homeowners, far from being encouraged to install solar panels through the possibility of selling surplus energy to the grid, were instead treated as suppliers and taxed accordingly. As a result, Spain’s solar business went into a steep decline.In contrast, Germany offers financial incentives to install solar panels, with the result that – with around half the sunshine hours – it generates 10 times more solar energy than Spain. The sunshine tax was scrapped after the socialists came to power in June 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e5908691bf52344a104b6e4762c3cabc4dd528/636_1495_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9c9e1079bc377fc6f15703504bdc3e8","title":"how to wear portrait neckline jess cartner morley","story":"Without being too frisky for work, this just low enough neckline will see you through to dinnerThe neckline of what you wear sets the mood for the whole outfit. I’m not being judgy about cleavage, by the way, this applies to men, too. (Think of Fleabag’s hot priest in his dog collar, or the difference two or three buttons unfastened makes to a man wearing a shirt.) Sometimes a no-frills crewneck or a crisp button-down collar are exactly what you need, but when the sun shines, I feel the pull of a low neckline. Not in a frisky way, just because it is nice to feel the sun on your skin. And if you are not a short skirt person, which I’m not, then that means a lower-than-crew neckline.But I can’t say I’m sorry that the off-the-shoulder milkmaid shape of the last couple of summers is on the wane. Nice as it is to ring the seasonal changes when summer finally arrives, we have not, as far as I am aware, time travelled into the 17th century. Lovely to be able to eat your sandwich in the park at lunchtime unnecessary to dress in full pre-industrial-era peasant cosplay, bare shoulders rising from a froth of broderie anglaise. Also, those necklines are rarely comfortable worn underneath a jacket and, really, you have to carry a straw basket rather than a normal bag, which is an odd look in an office. I make no apologies for overthinking the details of this look because that is what I’m here for, in case you haven’t noticed.There have been field reports of the deep V-shaped neckline showing signs of a comeback, but for now this does still give off a vibe of being imminently off to All Bar One to get hammered on white wine, which isn’t always the mood music we are after. So I turn with interest to the portrait neckline, as seen here.A portrait neckline is just-on-the-shoulder rather than off-the-shoulder, and plunges just enough to be vaguely dressy. It is perfect tabletop wear – as in, it’s what to wear when you will be seen across a table. (If you are at a dinner party, even the snazziest skirt will struggle to make an impact.) Tabletop wear means a detailed head-and-shoulders look, with your entrance elevated by the kind of shoes that are a treat to wear as long as you don’t have to stand up for too long. (These Jimmy Choo sandals of mine are a decade old but, since I have never walked more than a block in them, they are in mint condition.) A portrait neckline sets the right mood. By which I mean, it’s making me happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96be7f9ca6b406c01695c80709b773a5d1322cc8/0_791_1635_981/master/1635.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c2d9924b5d545a171e35149f1345110 660w","title":"michael caine best films ranked","story":"There’s much to find risible about this Hollywooded-up footballers-against-the Nazis yarn, but Caine’s avuncular presence keeps it watchable, bridging the gap between Sylvester Stallone’s sub-Rocky histrionics and the sheepish line readings of the real-life footballers involved. Not nearly as awful as it could have been.Probably the best – or least bad – of Caine’s late-70s-into-the-80s do-anything-for-money period, which included Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and Ashanti. The Swarm is actually pretty nifty: an insect-based carve-up from disaster-master Irwin Allen, featuring killer bees cutting a swathe through Texas. Caine is the prof who works out how to destroy them.A pretty straightforward rip-off of The French Connection, but entertainingly paying homage to the great French gangster movie tradition. Caine and co-star Anthony Quinn are namechecking leads Deray and Ventura, a killer-for-cash and American agent out to take down James Mason’s drug baron.Christopher Nolan’s ancestor worship has given Caine a late-career fillip. His role, as the boffin running a super-secret space agency in Nolan’s ambitious attempt to emulate Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, is a sort of autopilot-gravitas.Caine didn’t think much of Mike Hodges’ follow-up to Get Carter it’s very much not the lean, mean neo-noir that they managed for Carter. Pulp regained some critical credibility in the 90s (not least because of its title similarity to Pulp Fiction) and its labyrinthine literary musings look more interesting now.It was perhaps inevitable that Caine would show up in Mike Myers’ 60s-spy spoof: he plays Nigel, Austin and Evil’s dad, who is still the bum-pinching dinosaur of yore. Broad comedy mugging isn’t really Caine’s strength, but he gets through it fine.Caine issued a public call to be cast in a movie about the Hatton Garden job, and the result was pretty classy, compared with most of the geezer-gangster landfill of the past two decades. Caine skilfully brings out the inner desolation of his character even if the surrounding film’s attempt to humanise the robbers never quite hits high gear.Long considered a disaster – not least by Caine himself, who said he was forced into making it for legal reasons – this now comes across as the nuttiest of psychedelic period pieces, alternately baffling and flabbergasting. On some level Caine seems totally out of place, but that actually suits the bonkers material.Brian De Palma accumulated mucho trash points with this Psycho homage, even if its roll-up of dissociative identity disorder and trans-baiting, suspect back then, looks much worse now. But it was a real out-there choice for Caine, showing he was willing to break the boundaries of what was considered a safe role. Trigger warnings very much required nowadays.One of Caine’s better attempts to resuscitate his Harry Palmer persona: a cold-war thriller adapted from a Frederick Forsyth novel that managed to beat the Berlin wall coming down by a mere two years.Caine played third fiddle to Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan’s fifth feature, as another avuncular mentor figure who is given the all-important clip-worthy montage that explains how magic tricks work. He gets the required feels, even if he is a bit overshadowed by Nolan’s directorial fireworks.This should have been a stone cold classic: Caine in his early-70s pomp, Don Siegel directing, more gritty Harry Palmerisms. Caine holds the screen effortlessly (despite those ugly aviator specs he liked), but there’s something laborious about the spy-game thriller he’s been inserted into.Surprisingly impressive entry in the feral-council-estate-kids cycle of the mid-2000s, mostly due to Caine’s fervent commitment to the role as he transforms from realist-misery pensioner to creaky-limbed killing machine. It’s still bit of a Kipper’s revenge fantasy, though.Caine won his second Oscar (for best supporting actor) for this Lasse Hallström adaptation of John Irving’s novel he plays the ether-addicted orphanage director (and secret abortionist) Wilbur Larch. Caine is very good (despite his customary wobbly accent), but the social politics of the movie have dated horribly.Caine at bay is always an impressive sight, and here he gives it up in spades as an on-the-run wartime collaborator, protected by secretive church organisations from assassins who are out to get revenge. A well-made, if fundamentally old-fashioned drama, the interesting historical background underpins good work from Caine.Greenlighting a sequel to The Ipcress File was as easy as winking, and hiring Goldfinger’s director, Guy Hamilton, showed which way the producers wanted to go. Perhaps that explains why this Berlin-set spy game is a touch stodgier than its predecessor: Harry Palmer should be lighter on his feet than 007.Caine wouldn’t work with just anybody, you know: Nolan already had three features under his belt, and had directed Al Pacino. But Caine coming on board this Batman origins film was a real coup for the director, as well as re-engaging interest of a new generation of filmgoers for the actor. The butler role – another kindly tough-nut – didn’t take the actor to new areas, but it is probably the one that will define his late-phase career.Who can honestly see Caine – or Hollywood – making something like this again? A cast-of-thousands epic set during the thirty years’ war, with Caine as the captain of a band of ruthless mercenaries who take over an untouched rural backwater in 17th-century Germany. Worth it if only for the sight of Caine in a spiked war helmet.Caine wasn’t too keen on this third instalment in the Harry Palmer series, calling his suggestion to hire Ken Russell “a mistake”. Even if Russell never got around to outlining the actual plot too clearly, Caine is on good form, with all that trademark insolence present and correct.By the mid-80s Caine was firmly established as a top-notch ensemble player. Alan Alda’s slightly supercilious Hollywood comedy – in which Caine played a lothario film star – is a fine example of how Caine’s perfectly pitched charm could quietly dominate, even with high-grade performers such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Bob Hoskins on hand.Caine proved a good sport as Sandra Bullock’s beauty-pageant instructor in this cop thriller with radioactive levels of Bullock-patented perkiness. To his credit, Caine dials back the campness levels (lesser actors, no doubt, would have detonated the scale) it remains his most unlikely mentor-type role.Caine’s career was at a low-ish ebb in the mid-90s, but this ensemble noir from Bob “Five Easy Pieces” Rafelson stands out. Sporting another dodgy tache, Caine is excellent in a small-but-key role as Jack Nicholson’s safe-cracking partner in crime, as they go after a diamond necklace. A fine showcase for Caine’s amoral-ruthless qualities.An interesting step away from the sardonic thrillers and swinging-60s material that had made Caine a star. A sweaty, deep-south melodrama for Hollywood heavyweight director Otto Preminger, Caine played a racist speculator trying to diddle sharecroppers out of their land. One of the first signs that Caine was aiming for something bigger.By the mid-70s Caine was looking past lead roles: in this Sting-inspired period comedy he is well down the bill but still highly memorable, with more recent stars James Caan and Elliot Gould in the marquee roles. Caan and Gould are con artists aiming to beat Caine’s lordly bankrobber to a heist fun stuff.If one film shows that Caine really knew how to handle military grade weaponry, it’s this: a re-run by Robert Aldrich of his own hit movie The Dirty Dozen, about a British unit cut down fighting the Japanese in the Pacific islands. As the only survivor of a risky jungle mission (reflecting the current war in Vietnam), Caine channelled his own combat experience in Korea he looks pretty convincing.In an attempt to reinvigorate his Hollywood career after its late 70s downturn, Caine tried a bit of horror – then a modish option for actors on the slide. Caine chose wisely: this creepy little number about a comic book illustrator whose severed hand becomes an unstoppable killing machine was Oliver Stone’s first Hollywood film as director.Caine had already appeared in the cameo-stuffed The Wrong Box for director Bryan Forbes two years later he was a bona fide leading man, and took the main role in Forbes’ arty caper thriller. Its sexual politics look a little crass today, but Caine’s heavy-lidded charm holds it together.A somewhat forgotten entry in Joseph Losey’s canon, very much in the Antonioni style – lush, chilly interiors, moody set pieces and quizzical meditations on sex and the creative process. Caine brings conviction to his role as a novelist and husband to Glenda Jackson, who is contemplating having it away with a drug dealer in a Baden Baden spa hotel.No doubt feeling the pace of keeping a leading-man career going into its second decade, Caine’s participation in this Neil Simon ensemble piece was one of his first attempts to ersify. It allowed him to stretch and play against type. Here he is a gay antique dealer, in a marriage of convenience to Maggie Smith’s Oscar nominee, but unwilling to conceal his sexuality.Caine had a small but vivid role in Alfonso Cuarón’s ambitious dystopian satire again, very much against type as an ageing hippy and dope farmer. Caine apparently based his scruffy long-haired character on John Lennon and – almost unrecognisable – happily farts and sparks up a fat one.A war movie of quite extraordinary cynicism , in which the British higher-ups betray their own men to the Germans for strategic purposes an anti-establishment broadside that suited Caine’s late-60s mood perfectly. He plays posh: an oil executive attached to a unit of irregulars operating behind enemy lines in the north African desert. A real gut punch of a movie.If you can get past the male-gaze sleaziness of parts of Paolo Sorrentino’s melancholy fable, there’s a fine, wintry performance from Caine as an elderly composer spending time at a health spa for a check-up. As the title ironically indicates, this is all about the dying of the light, facing up to the end – and ruminating on the missed possibilities along the way.Like many of Caine’s 60s and 70s films, there’s a barrel-load of obsolescent cultural baggage to avert your eyes from – largely, in this case, stemming from the casting of Shirley MacLaine as a biracial showgirl called Nicole Chang. That said, this is otherwise a properly charming caper movie, with perceptible chemistry between him and MacLaine.Caine largely swerved the Brit-cinema revival of the mid- and late-90s, but he did do this adaptation of Jim Cartwright’s stage hit about a painfully shy homebody with a fantastic singing voice. Caine, as her raddled manager Ray Say, is fine – until, that is, he is elevated to magnificence with Ray’s astounding onstage meltdown, belting out It’s Over and shouting obscenities at an unimpressed talent scout. Genuinely extraordinary.Caine’s credentials as a heavyweight dramatic actor began to emerge in the early 80s this, along with Educating Rita, helped him make the transition. Caine is magnificent as Graham Greene’s alcoholic British diplomat, venal but remorseful as he grapples with his own failings.Caine’s casting in this, his first substantial film role, is the stuff of legend: called in to read for a working-class trooper, he emerged with the plum role of the officer-class Gonville Bromhead. Very much a passion project for the star, Stanley Baker, this heroic rendering of the battle of Rorke’s Drift has passed into Sunday teatime territory, even if many of its cultural assumptions look pretty shaky now. Caine made the most of the opportunity, though, in full damn-your-eyes mode.Of Caine’s vast back catalogue of second world war movies, this is probably the one that will endure. Adapted from a Jack Higgins novel, bearing a certain resemblance to Went the Day Well?, this has Caine as a sort-of good German leading a mission to infiltrate an English village and assassinate Churchill. It’s absorbing, well-crafted stuff, directed by John “The Great Escape” Sturges Caine, as ever, finds a way to dominate the film, and manifest an unlikely power of performance.A real hit in the UK, this adaptation of Willy Russell’s stage play made a star of its female lead, Julie Walters, but also confirmed Caine’s transition to a dramatic actor of substance. As a character – a middle-aged, jaded alcoholic – Caine’s Open University prof is not all that different from the one in The Honorary Consul, released the same year the narrative arc here is, however, rather more obviously redemptive and uplifting.A con artist movie in all but name, this saw Caine very much hold his own opposite Laurence Olivier – both were nominated for the best actor Oscar – as a cocky hairdresser duelling with Olivier’s jealous crime writer over who can freak out the other most successfully. Caine clearly liked the two-hander format, chalking up a string of impressive examples over the years, but this is the first, and one of the best.An unlikely subject for a film: a carload of grumpy old men taking the ashes of their dead friend to be scattered in Margate. From this, as explored in Graham Swift’s Booker prize-winning novel, writer-director Fred Schepisi wove an inexpressibly moving tapestry of memory and good fellowship, loyalty and thwarted hopes. Caine is the dead friend, seen (obviously) in flashback his ability to lead even the strongest ensemble cast (which included Tom Courtenay, Helen Mirren, Ray Winstone and Bob Hoskins) was never bettered.Another leftfield choice that showed Caine wasn’t afraid to take a chance: big stars didn’t do movies with puppets. This could easily have been a disaster, but Caine absolutely nails it as Scrooge his customary total commitment to a role undeterred by the presence of Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest. It’s the seriousness with which he takes it that’s the key: Caine said he would play it like Shakespeare, and he did.Of all the roles Caine played, you get the feeling he felt most personal kinship – at least in the early years as an actor – with Charlie Croker, the upstart bank robber whose overseas multimillion-pound heist is reconfigured by the film-makers as a reassertion of national pride and the revenge of the Little Englander in the age of vanishing empire. In some ways even more of a Kipper fantasy than Harry Brown, the compensation here is a tremendous sugar rush of entertainment.Caine made one of his rare 80s forays back home to play third fiddle to Bob Hoskins and Cathy Tyson in Neil Jordan’s undeniably haunting thriller. Even if he isn’t the main man, the role he plays – icily sleazy pimp Mortwell – is thoroughly memorable in its sheer nastiness.With The Honorary Consul, Caine had proved he could do Graham Greene, and the mood of compromise and self-reproach that it entailed. He is even better in this one, an adaptation of Greene’s excoriation of American exceptionalism in south-east Asia (a theme that proved unpopular in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks, when the film was originally supposed to be released). Caine’s attention to detail as he summons up the mood of conflicted melancholy secured an Oscar nomination.Caine played a fair few charming upper-class rogues in his time – mostly for Hollywood, it has to be said – and this is arguably the best: a Riviera-based swindler who latches on to rich women and relieves them of their cash. The presence of Steve Martin as his partnerrival elevates this comedy to classic status and, if the twist ending with Glenne Headly isn’t exactly a surprise, it’s all beautifully managed.This, more than Alfie, was the film that made Caine a star, and it is still absolutely terrific. Audiences got their first look at Caine’s deadpan, lizard-like charm, leavened with his then-modish street accent, which positioned him as a key player in the 60s culture wars. It also helps, of course, that it’s just a fantastically exciting thriller, with director Sidney J Furie going into overdrive as well as being a stylistic counterpoint to the flashier Bond films, it’s also much less bloated.If Ipcress got Caine front and centre, Alfie was the film that came to define his onscreen persona, at least at first. As the blazer-wearing, permacheating roué of the title, Caine perfectly encapsulated the boundary-pushing moral mood of the time – though in truth, this is a film about the failures and bleakness of the permissive lifestyle. Caine might not have been an absolute natural in the role – Terence Stamp, who turned down the film after playing the part on stage, would possibly have been a little more so – but Caine’s slight awkwardness arguably makes for more interesting drama. And it’s hard to see how Caine’s confidence in the direct-address bits could have been better.As the 70s dawned, Caine was incontrovertibly a big international star. His “coming home” to do a small-scale Brit gangster film was as much an event as Jack Carter heading back to Newcastle to sort out his brother’s killers. Conceived as a quantum leap forward in the way British organised crime was represented on screen – violent, nasty and businesslike – Get Carter emerged as a modern classic, with Caine a towering figure with a laser-like focus on getting the job done, both as a character and an actor.In retrospect, this looks like the first of a stream of pass-agg breakup notes Woody Allen was sending to Mia Farrow: Caine’s role, of a man so disgusted by Farrow’s niceness he has to go off and have an affair with someone in the immediate family, is a cleverly disguised Allen surrogate (given Allen is also in the film, playing a discontented TV writer). Notwithstanding the tsunami of bile that has swept over Allen since, this remains a richly observed drama, Chekhovian in its sweep and a testament to why Allen was (and still should be) regarded as a great film-maker. As ever making only the most perfunctory attempts to do the relevant accent, Caine’s ability to dredge vulnerability out of himself resulted in a quite extraordinary, even revelatory performance for once, an Oscar no one could argue with.Characteristically for Caine, collaboration brings out his absolute best. His double act with Sean Connery, in roles originally intended for Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart, is electrifying in absolutely the best way this is arguably Connery’s career high, too. Who knows how the American actors would have played it, but with Caine on board it became another upstart fable, the put-upon worker drones managing – at first, at least – to outsmart the boss class to grab a little loot for themselves. Of course, The Man Who Would Be King is a near textbook example of be careful what you wish for like The Italian Job, cliffs and gold play their part. There’s an extra resonance for contemporary audiences: this imperial-era study of the north-west frontier provides a lot of context for the current unrest in Afghanistan and Pakistan. (The naked racism on display, which undergoes a Kiplingesque modulation as the story progresses, is a similar eye-opener.) For Caine specifically, his screen charisma was never deployed better: crafty, resolute and empathetic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3caa50505c88d84738fc07a30bae7177469b0eeb/0_217_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baed98681e884c25b6c8a9bae4a8c526","title":"west coast california us wines less than 20 pounds fiona beckett","story":"Finding West Coast wines with character for less than £20 is tricky, but there are gems for UK drinkers among the chardonnay, cabernet, pinot noir and zinfandelSince the 1970s, Californian food has had the reputation for being ahead of the pack – fresh, local and plant-based long before the rest of the world went green – yet Californian wine is a quite different beast.Like many Californian wines (including two I hadn’t realised), Apothic is owned by the near-ubiquitous Gallo, which has 15 wineries across California and Washington state, including Barefoot.

The Tottenham manager is waiting to see whether the chairman, Daniel Levy, and the club’s recruitment staff can deliver on any of his transfer targets, who include Tanguy Ndombélé, Donny van de Beek, Nicolò Zaniolo and Ryan Sessesgnon.Pochettino has made it plain he wants to refresh at Spurs and a part of that means introducing new players for the first time since January 2018. There has even been the subtext that he would consider his position if Levy were to disappoint him.The Argentinian does not intend to return to England until the beginning of pre-season training – the players will report in the week of 8 July – and the wait could be a testing one. Yet, as things stand, Pochettino appears to have accepted a fundamental point, which is that the club’s outlook will not change radically.Levy will continue to balance incoming and departing player business as he meets the bank repayment deadlines on the stadium project, and that means Pochettino being denied the chance to attack the market with the gusto he might like.It is not easy for Pochettino. He has maintained the impression of progress at the club despite a clutch of problems, some of which were linked to the lack of signings last season. The squad came to look stretched and it was unusual to note that each of the 25 players who began the campaign last August started at least two games in the Premier League, including the back-up goalkeepers Paulo Gazzaniga and Michel Vorm.In the end, though, Pochettino is a company employee and the good news for Spurs fans is he and his staff are continuing to act like diligent staff. They are planning for next season with optimism, despite knowing they cannot compete in financial terms with their domestic top-six rivals – particularly the Manchester clubs and Liverpool. In short, Pochettino is digging in at Spurs for the next phase. He has the resources he has and it is about making the best of them.Pochettino and his inner circle have reflected on every detail of the past season, which ended with the 2-0 defeat by Liverpool in the Champions League final on 1 June. To them, a particular low came in the 2-1 win over Watford on 30 January, when only 29,000 came to watch them at Wembley. Pochettino would sometimes think when the club’s temporary home was full it was only because neutrals and tourists were able to buy tickets. The feel of Wembley was all wrong and Spurs’ exile from Tottenham could not end soon enough.Pochettino has never hidden his view that the league represents the true measure of a team’s level and it worries him that Spurs’ trends are negative. Yes, they finished in the top four again to make it four Champions League qualifications in a row but their points tally of 71 compared unfavourably with the 77 in 2017-18 and the 86 in 2016-17.The low return could be explained in part by the run to the Champions League final but that merely heightens the sense the squad is not deep enough or equipped to fight on multiple fronts. And that, once again, shines an unforgiving light on Levy’s recruitment policy.One of the main conversations to have taken place involves the team’s minimum level and how it may be raised. Pochettino and his staff believe the key to success over a long season is being able to get results on the bad days. To their minds Liverpool were very poor in the Champions League final whereas Spurs were about average and yet Jürgen Klopp’s team won with a measure of comfort.The thinking is that if a team’s minimum level is relatively high, it does not take much for them to jump to their very best. But if it is low, there is always the danger of non-performances and unacceptable defeats – such as the ones that Spurs suffered at Watford, Burnley and Southampton last season. Pochettino’s team can hammer Chelsea at home, for example, and they feel on their day they can beat anyone. But while there is a huge disparity between their top and bottom levels, there will be problems.Pochettino’s mission to find out why his players can sometimes plumb the depths is ongoing. To him, mentality is everything and he relished the work he oversaw on the psychological side with his squad in the three-week countdown to the Champions League final. He felt they were perfectly focused for the game, even though it would get away from them after the blow of an early penalty concession. The challenge for them is to maintain that focus over a 10-month period.Pochettino knows he cannot highlight, say, three weaknesses in his squad and simply go out to get three new players to solve them, and he is mindful his signings have tended to need six months to settle. He must adapt to what he has and that can mean tweaking his tactics. For example, he has come to realise Lucas Moura performs to his best as a second striker rather than a pure winger. Hence the move to incorporate a 4-4-2 diamond system.Pochettino is obsessed with driving improvement in every player, even if it is only small details, and that will remain his focus this summer. The approach extends to his support staff, who number 25 and include the medics and analysts. What worked in the various areas last season and what did not? How can they be more productive? Every year, Pochettino changes the organisation, the dynamics.It will be transfers that dominate the news agenda in the coming weeks and it is noticeable how Spurs have targeted young talent with the potential to grow. It is the trend across the board in the Premier League and, moreover, Pochettino might like to admit that his squad is not such a young one any more.There is an acceptance at the club that unwanted players may be difficult to shift. They have contracts, after all, and where could they go that would be an upgrade? What is more difficult to digest is how expensive the incoming targets may prove. Lyon, for example, want €75m (£67m) for Ndombélé, a hugely gifted midfielder.Christian Eriksen could hold the key to Spurs’ summer business. There was no surprise at the club when he announced he wanted to leave and the money his sale would generate could power the recruitment drive.And so back to the waiting. It can feel a little edgy, at times, with Pochettino, and everybody knows how quickly things can change in football. One thing is clear. Pochettino is counting on Levy to deliver something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56ecf5cfb5967a56a0e4be98bebd680a283b6a1e/0_121_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd95af84101e71f6257248eb98943624","title":"japan v scotland womens world cup 2019 live","story":"32 mins: From the corner, Iwabuchi fires into the side netting.

Anyway, time for the anthems. Japan’s is a subtle, sombre affair while ‘Flower of Scotland’ comes complete with the obligatory drums and pipes. There’s an estimated 5,000 Scotland fans in the house today.Scotland are one of four World Cup debutants in France, alongside Jamaica, Chile and South Africa. None have picked up a point yet, but they’ve shown they deserve a place – more on that, and further talking points, here:Shelley Kerr on picking Jane Ross: “Jane’s a top goalscorer. We need that threat today, you can’t sit behind the ball for 90 minutes. She provides an attacking threat, and we hope she can link up well with Erin Cuthbert.”Here’s an intriguing deep e into the unusual history of women’s football in Japan. As this quote shows, it was quite a journey to become world champions in 2011:“In the early 1980s, women’s tournaments even had different rules. The pitch was smaller they played with a special “girls’ ball” the halves were only 25 minutes long and hands were permitted if they were used to protect chests.”Shelley Kerr has rung the changes, with full-backs Sophie Howard and Nicola Docherty replaced by Kirsty Smith and Hayley Lauder, who wins her 100th cap. Jane Ross and Lizzie Arnot also come in, with the injured Christie Murray and Claire Emslie, the goalscorer against England, missing out.Japan coach Asako Takakura calls on experience in attack, with Mana Iwabuchi replacing Kumi Yokoyama. Nana Ichise and Jun Endo also come in, replacing Moeka Minami and Yui Hagesawa.Get to know both teams a little better with our expert guides:Scotland’s senior sides, as if you needed reminding, have never reached the knockout stages at a major tournament. The men have tried and failed 10 times, while the women’s team came up agonisingly short at Euro 2017.Shelley Kerr’s side may have lost their opening game here, but there are reasons to believe. They gave England a late scare in Nice, and face a Japan side who haven’t won in five matches and were held to a surprise 0-0 draw by Argentina.That said, Japan have been to the last two finals, and will be eager to show they are still contenders today. A point for Scotland here would set up a final showdown with Argentina, with a likely place in the last 16 for the winners.History informs us that with Scotland, things are rarely that straightforward. Kick-off is at 2pm, BST 3pm in Rennes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2aa091cf84cf6bd3c1a78f25678dcf29b4f3270/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0619985022b50eea1cfe47628d5fcb78","title":"progress on ending child labour stall in countries supplying goods to west","story":"China, India and Bangladesh among otherwise thriving countries failing to make headway on issue affecting 152 million minors Progress towards ending child labour has stalled in the countries most likely to be supplying goods to the west, a study has found.Despite high economic growth and big improvements in education and development, countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia have made little progress in tackling child labour.“The economic momentum of many countries is yet to trickle down to the poorest in society and any meaningful headway on labour rights issues, including child labour, remains elusive,” said Oscar Larsson, a human rights data analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, the risk analytics company that produced the analysis.Child labour victims number an estimated 152 million, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 73 million of whom work in hazardous conditions.Researchers ranked 198 countries based on their laws and adoption of international treaties, the ability and will to enforce them, and the frequency and severity of violations.The five highest-risk countries were North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Eritrea, and Central African Republic.The researchers also highlighted a rapidly escalating risk of child labour in Venezuela as a result of the country’s economic and political crisis. Venezuela has fallen 80 places in the index since 2016, and now ranks seventh.Globally, 27 countries – with a total collective population of 900 million people – were ranked as having an “extreme risk” of child labour. A further 82 countries were categorised as “high risk” in the index, including China (ranked 98th) and India (47th).If the frequency and severity of violations are looked at in isolation, both countries are considered to be at “extreme risk”.Violations refer to incidents where international treaties on child labour have been broken – for example, a child under 15 is found to be working in conditions that damage their development. Due to the hidden nature of such cases, the researchers estimated frequency by surveying a range of UN, ILO and NGO sources.Agriculture, manufacturing, apparel, construction, mining and hospitality all pose high levels of risk in both India and China, according to the study. Researchers also raised concern over the trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation of children.East Africa has five of the 10 highest risk countries globally, making it the region where children are most vulnerable, while 16 of the 27 “extreme risk” countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report.Cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a child labour magnet, according to Sam Haynes, head of risk indices at Maplecroft. He also identified coffee farming in Ghana as a high-risk sector.“In sub-Saharan Africa there’s a real mix of effectiveness of governments,” he said. “Some are trying to do good things but are failing because of the lack of effectiveness of the state.”Ben Smith, ILO’s senior specialist for child labour, said that, in absolute numbers, child labour in sub-Saharan Africa had overtaken child labour rates in Asia and the Pacific combined.The UN aims to end child labour of all forms by 2025 and has introduced measures such as cash transfer schemes for children who have to work due to their families falling on hard times.“At the current rate of decline we won’t get there.

I remember my first as if it were yesterday. I prepared weeks in advance, gathering intel from the wristband-flaunting older kids, and trawling internet noticeboards. I followed closely the advice to pack clothes you didn’t mind getting ruined, and plenty of socks (for trench foot). I even surveyed the Cool Parent contingent – the ones who take their children to Glastonbury and say things like: “I won’t say, ‘Don’t take drugs’, but I will say, ‘Stay hydrated’,” while winking.And my first festival delivered everything I imagined: music, adventure and friendship, with a background note of possible death. It would be the first of many, and the beginning of a lifelong love.But some years later, I detected a shift. Ticket prices shot up, headline acts smacked of nostalgia, and new music was forced on to smaller stages. People arrived in glamorous clothes, carrying coolbags filled with fancy wines. “Stupid 30-year-olds,” I’d rage. “Transforming the festival, while pricing us out.” I felt I was suddenly too young for these new festivals.And although my feelings changed (not least because I became that 30-year-old), I am reminded of this now, because the season is in full swing yet our usual gaggle is smaller than ever. “I’m too old,” came the RSVPs from friends.I’m told that at around my age, the feelings of being “too young for this” and “too old for that” overlap, before giving way to the latter.

By  Ronald PurserMindfulness has gone mainstream, with celebrity endorsement from Oprah Winfrey and Goldie Hawn. Meditation coaches, monks and neuroscientists went to Davos to impart the finer points to CEOs attending the World Economic Forum. The founders of the mindfulness movement have grown evangelical. Prophesying that its hybrid of science and meditative discipline “has the potential to ignite a universal or global renaissance”, the inventor of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Jon Kabat-Zinn, has bigger ambitions than conquering stress. Mindfulness, he proclaims, “may actually be the only promise the species and the planet have for making it through the next couple of hundred years”.So, what exactly is this magic panacea? In 2014, Time magazine put a youthful blonde woman on its cover, blissing out above the words: “The Mindful Revolution.” The accompanying feature described a signature scene from the standardised course teaching MBSR: eating a raisin very slowly. “The ability to focus for a few minutes on a single raisin isn’t silly if the skills it requires are the keys to surviving and succeeding in the 21st century,” the author explained.But anything that offers success in our unjust society without trying to change it is not revolutionary – it just helps people cope. In fact, it could also be making things worse. Instead of encouraging radical action, mindfulness says the causes of suffering are disproportionately inside us, not in the political and economic frameworks that shape how we live. And yet mindfulness zealots believe that paying closer attention to the present moment without passing judgment has the revolutionary power to transform the whole world. It’s magical thinking on steroids.There are certainly worthy dimensions to mindfulness practice. Tuning out mental rumination does help reduce stress, as well as chronic anxiety and many other maladies. Becoming more aware of automatic reactions can make people calmer and potentially kinder. Most of the promoters of mindfulness are nice, and having personally met many of them, including the leaders of the movement, I have no doubt that their hearts are in the right place. But that isn’t the issue here. The problem is the product they’re selling, and how it’s been packaged. Mindfulness is nothing more than basic concentration training. Although derived from Buddhism, it’s been stripped of the teachings on ethics that accompanied it, as well as the liberating aim of dissolving attachment to a false sense of self while enacting compassion for all other beings.What remains is a tool of self-discipline, disguised as self-help. Instead of setting practitioners free, it helps them adjust to the very conditions that caused their problems. A truly revolutionary movement would seek to overturn this dysfunctional system, but mindfulness only serves to reinforce its destructive logic. The neoliberal order has imposed itself by stealth in the past few decades, widening inequality in pursuit of corporate wealth. People are expected to adapt to what this model demands of them. Stress has been pathologised and privatised, and the burden of managing it outsourced to iniduals. Hence the pedlars of mindfulness step in to save the day.But none of this means that mindfulness ought to be banned, or that anyone who finds it useful is deluded. Reducing suffering is a noble aim and it should be encouraged. But to do this effectively, teachers of mindfulness need to acknowledge that personal stress also has societal causes. By failing to address collective suffering, and systemic change that might remove it, they rob mindfulness of its real revolutionary potential, reducing it to something banal that keeps people focused on themselves.The fundamental message of the mindfulness movement is that the underlying cause of dissatisfaction and distress is in our heads. By failing to pay attention to what actually happens in each moment, we get lost in regrets about the past and fears for the future, which make us unhappy. Kabat-Zinn, who is often labelled the father of modern mindfulness, calls this a “thinking disease”. Learning to focus turns down the volume on circular thought, so Kabat-Zinn’s diagnosis is that our “entire society is suffering from attention deficit disorder – big time”. Other sources of cultural malaise are not discussed. The only mention of the word “capitalist” in Kabat-Zinn’s book Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness occurs in an anecdote about a stressed investor who says: “We all suffer a kind of ADD.”Mindfulness advocates, perhaps unwittingly, are providing support for the status quo. Rather than discussing how attention is monetised and manipulated by corporations such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple, they locate the crisis in our minds. It is not the nature of the capitalist system that is inherently problematic rather, it is the failure of iniduals to be mindful and resilient in a precarious and uncertain economy. Then they sell us solutions that make us contented, mindful capitalists.By practising mindfulness, inidual freedom is supposedly found within “pure awareness”, undistracted by external corrupting influences. All we need to do is close our eyes and watch our breath. And that’s the crux of the supposed revolution: the world is slowly changed, one mindful inidual at a time. This political philosophy is oddly reminiscent of George W Bush’s “compassionate conservatism”. With the retreat to the private sphere, mindfulness becomes a religion of the self. The idea of a public sphere is being eroded, and any trickledown effect of compassion is by chance. As a result, notes the political theorist Wendy Brown, “the body politic ceases to be a body, but is, rather, a group of inidual entrepreneurs and consumers”.Mindfulness, like positive psychology and the broader happiness industry, has depoliticised stress. If we are unhappy about being unemployed, losing our health insurance, and seeing our children incur massive debt through college loans, it is our responsibility to learn to be more mindful. Kabat-Zinn assures us that “happiness is an inside job” that simply requires us to attend to the present moment mindfully and purposely without judgment. Another vocal promoter of meditative practice, the neuroscientist Richard Davidson, contends that “wellbeing is a skill” that can be trained, like working out one’s biceps at the gym. The so-called mindfulness revolution meekly accepts the dictates of the marketplace. Guided by a therapeutic ethos aimed at enhancing the mental and emotional resilience of iniduals, it endorses neoliberal assumptions that everyone is free to choose their responses, manage negative emotions, and “flourish” through various modes of self-care. Framing what they offer in this way, most teachers of mindfulness rule out a curriculum that critically engages with causes of suffering in the structures of power and economic systems of capitalist society.The term “McMindfulness” was coined by Miles Neale, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist, who described “a feeding frenzy of spiritual practices that provide immediate nutrition but no long-term sustenance”. The contemporary mindfulness fad is the entrepreneurial equal of McDonald’s. The founder of McDonald’s, Ray Kroc, created the fast food industry. Very early on, when he was selling milkshakes, Kroc spotted the franchising potential of a restaurant chain in San Bernadino, California. He made a deal to serve as the franchising agent for the McDonald brothers. Soon afterwards, he bought them out, and grew the chain into a global empire. Kabat-Zinn, a dedicated meditator, had a vision in the midst of a retreat: he could adapt Buddhist teachings and practices to help hospital patients deal with physical pain, stress and anxiety. His masterstroke was the branding of mindfulness as a secular spirituality.Kroc saw his chance to provide busy Americans with instant access to food that would be delivered consistently through automation, standardisation and discipline. Kabat-Zinn perceived the opportunity to give stressed-out Americans easy access to MBSR through an eight-week mindfulness course for stress reduction that would be taught consistently using a standardised curriculum. MBSR teachers would gain certification by attending programmes at Kabat-Zinn’s Center for Mindfulness in Worcester, Massachusetts. He continued to expand the reach of MBSR by identifying new markets such as corporations, schools, government and the military, and endorsing other forms of “mindfulness-based interventions” (MBIs).Both men took measures to ensure that their products would not vary in quality or content across franchises. Burgers and fries at McDonald’s are the same whether one is eating them in Dubai or in Dubuque. Similarly, there is little variation in the content, structuring and curriculum of MBSR courses around the world.Mindfulness has been oversold and commodified, reduced to a technique for just about any instrumental purpose. It can give inner-city kids a calming time-out, or hedge-fund traders a mental edge, or reduce the stress of military drone pilots. Void of a moral compass or ethical commitments, unmoored from a vision of the social good, the commodification of mindfulness keeps it anchored in the ethos of the market.This has come about partly because proponents of mindfulness believe that the practice is apolitical, and so the avoidance of moral inquiry and the reluctance to consider a vision of the social good are intertwined. It is simply assumed that ethical behaviour will arise “naturally” from practice and the teacher’s “embodiment” of soft-spoken niceness, or through the happenstance of self-discovery. However, the claim that major ethical changes will follow from “paying attention to the present moment, non-judgmentally” is patently flawed. The emphasis on “non-judgmental awareness” can just as easily disable one’s moral intelligence.In Selling Spirituality: The Silent Takeover of Religion, Jeremy Carrette and Richard King argue that traditions of Asian wisdom have been subject to colonisation and commodification since the 18th century, producing a highly inidualistic spirituality, perfectly accommodated to dominant cultural values and requiring no substantive change in lifestyle. Such an inidualistic spirituality is clearly linked with the neoliberal agenda of privatisation, especially when masked by the ambiguous language used in mindfulness. Market forces are already exploiting the momentum of the mindfulness movement, reorienting its goals to a highly circumscribed inidual realm.Mindfulness is easily co-opted and reduced to merely “pacifying feelings of anxiety and disquiet at the inidual level, rather than seeking to challenge the social, political and economic inequalities that cause such distress”, write Carrette and King. But a commitment to this kind of privatised and psychologised mindfulness is political – therapeutically optimising iniduals to make them “mentally fit”, attentive and resilient, so they may keep functioning within the system. Such capitulation seems like the farthest thing from a revolution – more like a quietist surrender.Mindfulness is positioned as a force that can help us cope with the noxious influences of capitalism. But because what it offers is so easily assimilated by the market, its potential for social and political transformation is neutered. Leaders in the mindfulness movement believe that capitalism and spirituality can be reconciled they want to relieve the stress of iniduals without having to look deeper and more broadly at its causes.A truly revolutionary mindfulness would challenge the western sense of entitlement to happiness irrespective of ethical conduct. However, mindfulness programmes do not ask executives to examine how their managerial decisions and corporate policies have institutionalised greed, ill will and delusion. Instead, the practice is being sold to executives as a way to de-stress, improve productivity and focus, and bounce back from working 80-hour weeks. They may well be “meditating”, but it works like taking an aspirin for a headache. Once the pain goes away, it is business as usual. Even if iniduals become nicer people, the corporate agenda of maximising profits does not change.If mindfulness just helps people cope with the toxic conditions that make them stressed in the first place, then perhaps we could aim a bit higher. Should we celebrate the fact that this perversion is helping people to “auto-exploit” themselves? This is the core of the problem. The internalisation of focus for mindfulness practice also leads to other things being internalised, from corporate requirements to structures of dominance in society. Perhaps worst of all, this submissive position is framed as freedom. Indeed, mindfulness thrives on doublespeak about freedom, celebrating self-centered “freedoms” while paying no attention to civic responsibility, or the cultivation of a collective mindfulness that finds genuine freedom within a co-operative and just society.Of course, reductions in stress and increases in personal happiness and wellbeing are much easier to sell than serious questions about injustice, inequity and environmental devastation. The latter involve a challenge to the social order, while the former play directly to mindfulness’s priorities – sharpening people’s focus, improving their performance at work and in exams, and even promising better sex lives. Not only has mindfulness been repackaged as a novel technique of psychotherapy, but its utility is commercially marketed as self-help. This branding reinforces the notion that spiritual practices are indeed an inidual’s private concern. And once privatised, these practices are easily co-opted for social, economic and political control.Rather than being used as a means to awaken iniduals and organisations to the unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion, mindfulness is more often refashioned into a banal, therapeutic, self-help technique that can actually reinforce those roots.Mindfulness is said to be a $4bn industry. More than 60,000 books for sale on Amazon have a variant of “mindfulness” in their title, touting the benefits of Mindful Parenting, Mindful Eating, Mindful Teaching, Mindful Therapy, Mindful Leadership, Mindful Finance, a Mindful Nation, and Mindful Dog Owners, to name just a few. There is also The Mindfulness Colouring Book, part of a bestselling subgenre in itself. Besides books, there are workshops, online courses, glossy magazines, documentary films, smartphone apps, bells, cushions, bracelets, beauty products and other paraphernalia, as well as a lucrative and burgeoning conference circuit. Mindfulness programmes have made their way into schools, Wall Street and Silicon Valley corporations, law firms, and government agencies, including the US military.The presentation of mindfulness as a market-friendly palliative explains its warm reception in popular culture. It slots so neatly into the mindset of the workplace that its only real threat to the status quo is to offer people ways to become more skilful at the rat race. Modern society’s neoliberal consensus argues that those who enjoy power and wealth should be given free rein to accumulate more. It’s perhaps no surprise that those mindfulness merchants who accept market logic are a hit with the CEOs in Davos, where Kabat-Zinn has no qualms about preaching the gospel of competitive advantage from meditative practice.Over the past few decades, neoliberalism has outgrown its conservative roots. It has hijacked public discourse to the extent that even self-professed progressives, such as Kabat-Zinn, think in neoliberal terms. Market values have invaded every corner of human life, defining how most of us are forced to interpret and live in the world.Perhaps the most straightforward definition of neoliberalism comes from the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who calls it “a programme for destroying collective structures that may impede the pure market logic”. We are generally conditioned to think that a market-based society provides us with ample (if not equal) opportunities for increasing the value of our “human capital” and self-worth. And in order to fully actualise personal freedom and potential, we need to maximise our own welfare, freedom, and happiness by deftly managing internal resources.Since competition is so central, neoliberal ideology holds that all decisions about how society is run should be left to the workings of the marketplace, the most efficient mechanism for allowing competitors to maximise their own good. Other social actors – including the state, voluntary associations, and the like – are just obstacles to the smooth operation of market logic.For an actor in neoliberal society, mindfulness is a skill to be cultivated, or a resource to be put to use. When mastered, it helps you to navigate the capitalist ocean’s tricky currents, keeping your attention “present-centred and non-judgmental” to deal with the inevitable stress and anxiety from competition. Mindfulness helps you to maximise your personal wellbeing.All of this may help you to sleep better at night. But the consequences for society are potentially dire. The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has analysed this trend. As he sees it, mindfulness is “establishing itself as the hegemonic ideology of global capitalism”, by helping people “to fully participate in the capitalist dynamic while retaining the appearance of mental sanity”.By deflecting attention from the social structures and material conditions in a capitalist culture, mindfulness is easily co-opted. Celebrity role models bless and endorse it, while Californian companies including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Zynga have embraced it as an adjunct to their brand. Google’s former in-house mindfulness tsar Chade-Meng Tan had the actual job title Jolly Good Fellow. “Search inside yourself,” he counselled colleagues and readers – for there, not in corporate culture – lies the source of your problems.The rhetoric of “self-mastery”, “resilience” and “happiness” assumes wellbeing is simply a matter of developing a skill. Mindfulness cheerleaders are particularly fond of this trope, saying we can train our brains to be happy, like exercising muscles. Happiness, freedom and wellbeing become the products of inidual effort. Such so-called “skills” can be developed without reliance on external factors, relationships or social conditions. Underneath its therapeutic discourse, mindfulness subtly reframes problems as the outcomes of choices. Personal troubles are never attributed to political or socioeconomic conditions, but are always psychological in nature and diagnosed as pathologies. Society therefore needs therapy, not radical change. This is perhaps why mindfulness initiatives have become so attractive to government policymakers. Societal problems rooted in inequality, racism, poverty, addiction and deteriorating mental health can be reframed in terms of inidual psychology, requiring therapeutic help. Vulnerable subjects can even be told to provide this themselves.Neoliberalism ides the world into winners and losers. It accomplishes this task through its ideological linchpin: the inidualisation of all social phenomena. Since the autonomous (and free) inidual is the primary focal point for society, social change is achieved not through political protest, organising and collective action, but via the free market and atomised actions of iniduals. Any effort to change this through collective structures is generally troublesome to the neoliberal order. It is therefore discouraged.An illustrative example is the practice of recycling. The real problem is the mass production of plastics by corporations, and their overuse in retail. However, consumers are led to believe that being personally wasteful is the underlying issue, which can be fixed if they change their habits. As a recent essay in Scientific American scoffs: “Recycling plastic is to saving the Earth what hammering a nail is to halting a falling skyscraper.” Yet the neoliberal doctrine of inidual responsibility has performed its sleight-of-hand, distracting us from the real culprit. This is far from new. In the 1950s, the “Keep America Beautiful” campaign urged iniduals to pick up their trash. The project was bankrolled by corporations such as Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and Phillip Morris, in partnership with the public service announcement Ad Council, which coined the term “litterbug” to shame miscreants. Two decades later, a famous TV ad featured a Native American man weeping at the sight of a motorist dumping garbage. “People Start Pollution. People Can Stop It,” was the slogan. The essay in Scientific American, by Matt Wilkins, sees through such charades.At face value, these efforts seem benevolent, but they obscure the real problem, which is the role that corporate polluters play in the plastic problem. This clever misdirection has led journalist and author Heather Rogers to describe Keep America Beautiful as the first corporate greenwashing front, as it has helped shift the public focus to consumer recycling behaviour and thwarted legislation that would increase extended producer responsibility for waste management.We are repeatedly sold the same message: that inidual action is the only real way to solve social problems, so we should take responsibility. We are trapped in a neoliberal trance by what the education scholar Henry Giroux calls a “disimagination machine”, because it stifles critical and radical thinking. We are admonished to look inward, and to manage ourselves. Disimagination impels us to abandon creative ideas about new possibilities. Instead of seeking to dismantle capitalism, or rein in its excesses, we should accept its demands and use self-discipline to be more effective in the market. To change the world, we are told to work on ourselves — to change our minds by being more mindful, nonjudgmental, and accepting of circumstances.It is a fundamental tenet of neoliberal mindfulness, that the source of people’s problems is found in their heads. This has been accentuated by the pathologising and medicalisation of stress, which then requires a remedy and expert treatment – in the form of mindfulness interventions. The ideological message is that if you cannot alter the circumstances causing distress, you can change your reactions to your circumstances. In some ways, this can be helpful, since many things are not in our control. But to abandon all efforts to fix them seems excessive. Mindfulness practices do not permit critique or debate of what might be unjust, culturally toxic or environmentally destructive. Rather, the mindful imperative to “accept things as they are” while practising “nonjudgmental, present moment awareness” acts as a social anesthesia, preserving the status quo.The mindfulness movement’s promise of “human flourishing” (which is also the rallying cry of positive psychology) is the closest it comes to defining a vision of social change. However, this vision remains inidualised and depends on the personal choice to be more mindful. Mindfulness practitioners may of course have a very different political agenda to that of neoliberalism, but the risk is that they start to retreat into their own private worlds and particular identities — which is just where the neoliberal power structures want them.Mindfulness practice is embedded in what Jennifer Silva calls the “mood economy”. In Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty, Silva explains that, like the privatisation of risk, a mood economy makes “iniduals solely responsible for their emotional fates”. In such a political economy of affect, emotions are regulated as a means to enhance one’s “emotional capital”. At Google’s Search Inside Yourself mindfulness programme, emotional intelligence (EI) figures prominently in the curriculum. The programme is marketed to Google engineers as instrumental to their career success — by engaging in mindfulness practice, managing emotions generates surplus economic value, equivalent to the acquisition of capital. The mood economy also demands the ability to bounce back from setbacks to stay productive in a precarious economic context. Like positive psychology, the mindfulness movement has merged with the “science of happiness”. Once packaged in this way, it can be sold as a technique for personal life-hacking optimisation, disembedding iniduals from social worlds.All the promises of mindfulness resonate with what the University of Chicago cultural theorist Lauren Berlant calls “cruel optimism”, a defining neoliberal characteristic. It is cruel in that one makes affective investments in what amount to fantasies. We are told that if we practice mindfulness, and get our inidual lives in order, we can be happy and secure. It is therefore implied that stable employment, home ownership, social mobility, career success and equality will naturally follow. We are also promised that we can gain self-mastery, controlling our minds and emotions so we can thrive and flourish amid the vagaries of capitalism.As Joshua Eisen, the author of Mindful Calculations, puts it: “Like kale, acai berries, gym memberships, vitamin water, and other new year’s resolutions, mindfulness indexes a profound desire to change, but one premised on a fundamental reassertion of neoliberal fantasies of self-control and unfettered agency.” We just have to sit in silence, watching our breath, and wait. It is doubly cruel because these normative fantasies of the “good life” are already crumbling under neoliberalism, and we make it worse if we focus inidually on our feelings. Neglecting shared vulnerabilities and interdependence, we disimagine the collective ways we might protect ourselves. And despite the emptiness of nurturing fantasies, we continue to cling to them.Mindfulness isn’t cruel in and of itself. It’s only cruel when fetishised and attached to inflated promises. It is then, as Berlant points out, that “the object that draws your attachment actively impedes the aim that brought you to it initially”. The cruelty lies in supporting the status quo while using the language of transformation. This is how neoliberal mindfulness promotes an inidualistic vision of human flourishing, enticing us to accept things as they are, mindfully enduring the ravages of capitalism.Adapted from McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality by Ronald Purser, published by Repeater Books on 9 July and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76c21232272d63584badb26c9e191804f706f100/1225_17_4315_2589/master/4315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69c2130f06bea38867fc3ed90a0e5a39","title":"uk first 100 vegan hotel saorsa 1875 opens in the highlands","story":"Family firm hopes to attract people keen to try plant-based alternatives to meatIn the kitchen of Saorsa 1875, Luca Sordi is decorating a scoop of zesty almond butter with a sprinkling of fermented spruce tips.“It’s possible to make a meringue using the cooking water of chickpeas, or a panna cotta with a kind of seaweed,” says Sordi, who re-trained as a chef after becoming a vegetarian, and has seldom cooked meat. “But it’s not about recreating something we are missing. This is getting the best from what is in nature.”“Scotland has an amazing vegan scene in Glasgow, and in Edinburgh,” said Jack McLaren-Stewart, who has launched this family project in Pitlochry, Perthshire, with his business partner and mother, Sandra. Both are long-term vegetarians who became vegan about five years ago. He said: “But as you start to come into the Highlands it becomes progressively hard to be vegan. At best you get one vegetarian option on a menu. This is about giving people the opportunity to come to a beautiful place and not feel like they have to compromise at all.”This has demanded an investigative approach to food and furnishing. Wines might appear vegan but many are filtered using isinglass, from the swim bladder of fish. Plenty of duvets are made without feathers nowadays, but their microfibres may have added wool and sourcing vegan slug repellant remains a challenge.What is most evident from a visit to the premises is how unobtrusive these changes are. Upstairs in the 11 guest bedrooms, where Sandra McLaren-Stewart’s interior design training has come to the fore, there is the same statement wallpaper, voluminous bedding and extravagant throws one might expect in any stylish boutique hotel, except that here the wools, silks and leather have been replaced with linen, cotton, velvet and manmade fibres.She said: “People see our lifestyle choice as abstinent. We’re not partaking fully in life because we’re having to leave all these things off the menu, all these things you can’t enjoy. We wanted to create some place to say ‘you can’. Even with clothes, you can buy non-leather shoes, or Fairtrade cotton, there’s a huge push.”While growing awareness of how animal agriculture might effect the climate emergency is prompting more and more of us to consider plant-based alternatives, it’s fair to say that veganism continues to attract some residual sneering . Witness William Sitwell, who quit as the editor of Waitrose Food magazine after an email exchange in which he joked about“killing vegans”. “I think it forces people to question their own choices and sometimes that makes them uncomfortable,” said Sandra diplomatically.Interest in veganism from the hospitality and tourism sector has only really kicked off in the UK in the past two years, said Dominika Piasecka, a spokesperson for the Vegan Society. “We are getting a lot of queries from restaurants. They need to see that vegan options are selling, and often they don’t know how to cook a decent vegan dish. So far, it’s mainly in the cities and large towns but other places are slowly catching up.“Knowing that no animal had to suffer for the hotel equipment or cosmetics gives vegans peace of mind, and supporting ethical businesses makes their holiday that much more enjoyable.”The potatoes in the hotel vegetable patch are thriving, and a selection of apple and cherry saplings are taking root. Most fruit and vegetables are sourced locally, said Jack – “although Perthshire is not exactly known for its lemons” – with coffee from Aberfeldy and bread from a bakery in Crieff.He said he was keen to attract the “plant-curious” as well as committed vegans and vegetarians. “When you become vegan and throw yourself into the movement you discover it is really vibrant and there are so many people doing these amazing innovative things. “We really wanted to have a place that showcased that, and that other people can come to. We don’t have a doorman checking if you’re vegan or you’re not coming in. But maybe coming with your partner who is not vegan, or a couple who think we’ve heard so much about it let’s give it a try.”The family are both delighted and a little overwhelmed by the initial reception to their all-vegan venture, with the first weekend fully booked. “The feedback has been amazing,” said Jack. “We’ve been bombarded with messages of support from all over the world.

It was also confirmed that no senior Channel 4 executives would move to the city as part of the broadcaster’s relocation.In Leeds the responses have included astonishment, some sympathy, a little disappointment and even offers of free kebabs to tempt Channel 4 staff.Field, previously from Streatham in south London, is the head of production at Daisybeck Studios, an independent television production company. She said she was living her dream life in a canal-side converted warehouse apartment in Leeds, and was shocked at fellow Londoners’ reticence to give the north a chance.“The standard of living and lifestyle here is so wonderful. You can find really good accommodation for not very much money, you still get decent salaries and it is a vibrant, energised city – there is such a buzz,” she said.“I was born in London and I love London and that’s where my family live, but the change in lifestyle and the way I am able to work up here is radically different, better than the way I was working before. There needs to be a cultural shift in the way people think in London as it is no longer affordable.”When Channel 4 finishes its redistribution of staff, a relatively small number of the 300 are expected to move from its London HQ in Horseferry Road, Westminster.The award-winning journalist and film-maker Andrew Sheldon, who is the creative director of the production company True North, helped in the bid to bring Channel 4 to Leeds. He said it was important to shift the industry’s epicentre away from London.“We always knew that if Channel 4 came to Leeds it would be absolutely transformative. We feel it already, tangibly in the city,” he said.The 57-year-old, who briefly lived in Tooting Bec in south London in his 20s, said although he was disappointed he sympathised with Channel 4’s employees.“What Channel 4 set out to do is something very strategic and in the long term it will have a really positive effect. The very real downside of that is it is hard to make a change like this without there being a real human impact,” he said.“The industry is quite well used to change but that doesn’t devalue the fact that you are saying to people with friends and families and lifestyles that we now want you to move 200 miles away. What’s disappointing is that there is a great deal to offer in this part of the world both professionally and in terms of lifestyle. It’s a shame that more people haven’t taken a look at what is possible.”Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP for Leeds West, said she was “astonished”.She said: “Channel 4 chose our fantastic city over places like Birmingham and Manchester for lots of reasons. There are loads of talented people in Leeds and across Yorkshire who would jump at the chance to work with Channel 4. It will be a great chance to help build a new skills base in our region and draw in further investment and jobs.“And, to those people working for Channel 4 in London at the moment who are wondering whether to relocate, I’d encourage them to give Leeds a go. It’s a brilliant place to live and work.”For Sheldon, who began his career on the Yorkshire Post, the opportunities that the broadcaster’s relocation will bring outweigh any negativity. “Why should you – if you are a working-class kid from Hartlepool, Hull, Grimsby and Barnsley – have to go to London?“When I was a kid there was opportunities and I could get a job at a local paper, but nowadays kids on this side of the Pennines haven’t had that door to knock on and Channel 4 won’t just give them one door to knock on but it’ll give them a lot of doors to knock on. It is an incredibly exciting time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0d4c06e1c45d407b959d8acffa238626bd8985/0_220_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=822c8222219d5616fef777def488fc44","title":"julian assange to face us extradition hearing in uk next year","story":"WikiLeaks founder, indicted on 18 counts in US, will have a five-day hearing in FebruaryJulian Assange will face a five-day US extradition hearing in February next year, a judge has ruled.The WikiLeaks founder faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act.At Westminster magistrates court on Friday, the chief magistrate, Emma Arbuthnot, ordered that a full extradition hearing should begin on 25 February.Ben Brandon, representing the US, formally opened the case, a day after an extradition request was signed off by the home secretary, Sajid Javid.“This is related to one of the largest compromises of confidential information in the history of the United States,” Brandon told the court.As Brandon ran through a summary of the accusations against Assange, including that he had cracked a US defence network password, Assange, appearing by video link, protested: “I didn’t break any password whatsoever.”Assange, 47, who was dressed in a grey T-shirt, had a white beard and was wearing black-framed glasses, said 175 years of his life was at stake and defended his website against hacking claims, saying: “WikiLeaks is nothing but a publisher.”His lawyer, Mark Summers QC, described the case as “an outrageous and full-frontal assault on journalistic rights”.WikiLeaks releases about 470,000 classified military documents concerning American diplomacy and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It later releases a further tranche of more than 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables.A Swedish prosecutor issues a European arrest warrant for Assange over sexual assault allegations involving two Swedish women. Assange denies the claims.He turns himself in to police in London and is placed in custody. He is later released on bail and calls the Swedish allegations a smear campaign.A British judge rules that Assange can be extradited to Sweden.

He requests, and is later granted, political asylum.Assange\u0026nbspis questioned\u0026nbspin a two-day interview over the allegations at the Ecuadorian embassy by Swedish authorities.WikiLeaks says Assange could travel to the United States to face investigation if his rights are \u0027guaranteed\u0027. It comes after one of the site\u0027s main sources of leaked documents, Chelsea Manning, is given clemency.Swedish prosecutors say they have closed their seven-year sex assault investigation into Assange. British police say they would still arrest him if he leaves the embassy as he breached the terms of his bail in 2012.Britain refuses Ecuador\u0027s request to accord Assange diplomatic status, which would allow him to leave the embassy without being arrested.He loses a bid to have his British arrest warrant cancelled on health grounds.Ecuador cuts off Assange\u0027s internet access alleging he broke an agreement on interfering in other countries\u0027 affairs.US prosecutors inadvertently disclose the existence of a sealed indictment against Assange.Ecuador\u0027s President Lenin Moreno says Assange has \u0027repeatedly violated\u0027 the conditions of his asylum at the embassy.Police arrest Assange at the embassy\u0026nbspon behalf of the US after his asylum was withdrawn. He is charged by the US with \u0027a federal charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer.\u0027He is jailed for 50 weeks\u0026nbspin the UK for breaching his bail conditions back in 2012. An apology letter from Assange is read out in court, but the judge rules that he had engaged in a \u0027deliberate attempt to evade justice\u0027. On the following day the US extradition proceedings were formally started.\u0026nbspSwedish prosecutors announce they are reopening an investigation into a rape allegation against Julian Assange.Home secretary Sajid Javid reveals he has signed the US extradition order for Assange paving the way for it to be heard in court.His legal team also said he was challenging the 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail he is serving after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden.Assange is accused in the US of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer.Outside the court, his supporters protested against the UK’s treatment of him. A crowd of around a dozen people held banners, with some chanting “Justice for Julian Assange” and “Defend freedom and democracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f4201d62a7e5ec38e35c1781be05602e946859/0_0_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efba8ec5b8da6736acc48b65efe87c4a","title":"how lisa left eye lopes rb trio blaque wrestled their album from matthew knowles","story":"Blaque had the world at their feet but a double tragedy left them struggling to release their musicThere was a moment, around the turn of the millennium, where everything went Blaque. Discovered by Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, the teen three-piece perfected the slinky stutters of that era’s R\u0026ampB pop, with imagery that repacked Missy Elliott’s third-eye Afrofuturism for a gel pen-loving generation. As a kid-friendly TLC, Shamari DeVoe (née Fears), Brandi Williams and Natina Reed shared their predecessors’ intolerance for scrubs. If men featured in their videos, they were eyeballed like pick’n’mix and then discarded, unworthy of being in their orbit.Blaque’s boldness – down to their homemade bubblewrap look – turned out to be their special sauce. With 1.5m debut album sales and tour dates with ‘NSync and TLC, they were poised to become 00s pop’s next mammoth girl group. Second album, Blaque Out!, however, was scrapped (it showed up on iTunes a decade later), while its feisty lead single Can’t Get It Back flopped and became a hit for Mis-Teeq instead. Then, following the death of Left Eye in 2002, Blaque lost their biggest cheerleader. “I definitely felt let down by the industry,” says DeVoe, also a cast member on Real Housewives of Atlanta. “There was a point where I lost my passion to ever want to sing again.”After Reed’s tragic death in a road accident in 2012, fan clamour for another unreleased Blaque album, 2003’s Torch, began to grow. Encouraged by a petition, the group won back the rights to their recordings from one-time manager Matthew Knowles, and the album finally came out last month. “It feels really good to finally release it,” says Williams. “And with us able to own these songs now, and our fans still wanting to hear them, I actually think this is perfect timing.”Despite its of-the-time production, Torch is a way more fun and inventive R\u0026ampB album than recent releases from Blaque’s millennium-era peers such as Ciara or Usher. Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins and Linda Perry contribute, and Missy Elliott brings an out-of-the-box spirit to five tracks. The album closes with Her Name Is, a tribute to Left Eye. “Lisa was so much to us,” says Williams. “She was a true friend, a big sister, a mother figure. For us to lose her at such an early time in our career was just a devastating blow.”Blaque are now planning a string of US shows as a two-piece, as well as brand new music soon. “Twenty years ago, you had to have a major label behind you,” says Williams. “Now, artists are able to put their careers in their own hands. Shamari and I are really interested in taking the independent route.” In a career marked by label disputes and personal tragedy, Blaque have weathered the knocks and are ready to thrive again. “I wanna make sure that we continue to keep Natina’s legacy alive,” says DeVoe. “We’re doing this for Natina and Lisa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc7e03b68490df6acc8422afad6249dd1969201/50_554_4280_2569/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785922addb24b9493cc05c267ea3c567","title":"private armies secret deals russia putin drive into africa","story":"A cache of leaked documents appear to show how a close Putin ally is leading a push to turn Africa into a strategic hub with echoes of Soviet-era zones of influence.

Michael Gove’s team had also been making overtures to Hancock, believing their candidate could take on Johnson most effectively. Javid’s team argue he is a more convincing “change candidate”.Hancock was a longtime adviser to George Osborne when the Conservatives were in opposition. He served as the culture secretary – famously promoting himself through an eponymous app – before becoming the health secretary.Hancock picked up 20 votes in the first ballot of Tory MPs – enough to pass the threshold of 17 for continuing into the next round on Tuesday, but well short of the 33 needed to continue beyond that. His prominent backers included the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington.Hancock’s pitch to his colleagues had been that he was best-placed to appeal to voters in the centre ground of British politics, but that meant appealing to a similar group of MPs to Rory Stewart.Stewart received 19 votes but has said he is determined to continue with his quixotic #RoryWalks campaign, insisting he is the best person to take on fellow old Etonian Johnson.Hancock told the  on Wednesday: “Of course we’ve got to deliver Brexit but then we’ve got to win a majority by appealing to aspirational people in the centre ground of British politics, where there’s a gaping hole.”He added: “There are some candidates who won’t be able to bring the Conservative party with them, and there are others who will find it more difficult to reach into the centre ground. I think I’m best placed to be able to do both.”Johnson’s progress to 10 Downing Street appears unstoppable, after he won 114 votes in the first round of the contest. But he is facing accusations of hiding from public scrutiny, having so far failed to confirm that he will take part in Sunday’s televised debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57af62abd60cfe4974f44d748f4a9bc41c1bdba8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d9a8b3a1102280e292121059f041ab","title":"change uk how not to set up a political party podcast","story":"With six of its 11 MPs having quit, Heather Stewart, the ’s political editor, charts what went wrong.

With 9.6 seconds left and the Raptors up by one point, 111-110, the Raptors committed a costly turnover after Danny Green threw an errant pass to Pascal Siakam. The Warriors had a chance to win when Stephen Curry shot a three-pointer over two defenders with eight seconds left, but the ball rolled out of the rim.In a mad scramble for possession near center court, Draymond Green attempted to call a timeout with 0.9 seconds left, but the Warriors didn’t have any left and were assessed a technical foul. The Raptors went on to make the free throw they were awarded, and two more after Kawhi Leonard was fouled just before the buzzer.The victory wasn’t just historic. It was highly impressive given the raucous crowd in Oakland that was both trying to keep their team’s dynasty alive and honoring the Warriors’ final game ever at Oracle Arena.“They really played together,” Raptors’ coach Nick Nurse said. “I thought they really fought hard. They were tough-minded. They didn’t seem like this was wearing on them at all. Two months of playoff basketball, they never seemed tired to me.”The scene in the locker room after the game was one of pure joy, with goggle-clad players spraying champagne in every direction and corks littered all over plastic-covered carpet.The game had its fair share of drama, too, including 18 lead changes. It also had its share of heartbreak. The Warriors, who were playing without Kevin Durant after he sustained a ruptured achilles tendon in Game 5, also went on to lose Klay Thompson to an injury later confirmed by his agent as a torn left anterior cruciate ligament.It happened with 2:22 left in the third quarter, after Thompson was fouled hard on a dunk and fell to the floor writhing in pain, clutching his left leg. He was walked to the locker room by teammates Jordan Bell and Jonas Jerebko. A breathless few seconds later, Thompson limped back onto the court as a shocked Oracle Arena roared at his show of heart.Thompson went on to make two free throws. (If he hadn’t taken those free throws, he wouldn’t have been eligible to return.) Shortly thereafter, he was ruled out for the rest of the game. He finished with a game-high 30 points on 8-for-12 shooting, including making four of his six three-point shots in 32 minutes.It was a complete team effort for the Raptors. Leonard, who carried the Raptors on his back throughout the playoffs, was named NBA finals MVP for the second time (after 2014 with the Spurs), finishing with 22 points on 7-for-16 shooting, six rebounds and three assists.He said afterward it was extra special to him considering what he went through last season in San Antonio, when Leonard said some people thought he was “either faking an injury or didn’t want to play for a team” when he only appeared in nine games due to tendinopathy.“Just being able to win this championship this year is just something special for me because you know how last year everybody was looking at me, and I stayed true to myself, and I had a great support system,” Leonard said. “And once I got here to Toronto, they understood everything and kept moving from there.”Kyle Lowry opened the game with a flurry, pouring in 11 early points on 4-for-4 from the floor, including makes on all three of his three-pointers. In the first two minutes of the game, he scored more than he did in Game 5 (10 points on three-for-12 shooting). He finished with a 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists.Pascal Siakam continued his season-long emergence into a star with a 26-point performance on 10-for-17 shooting and 10 rebounds on the biggest of stages, making it hard to believe that he burst from obscurity just a short time ago. Fred Vanvleet added 22 points, scoring 12 of them in the fourth quarter.The Raptors opened the game strong, taking a quick 8-0 lead. Curry, who finished with 21 points, didn’t attempt a field goal until there was 1:25 left in the first quarter. Naturally, when he finally did it ignited the 47-year-old arena as he swished a highly contested three-pointer.Draymond Green logged a triple-double with 11 points, 19 rebounds and 13 assists. Two of those assists came off of dunks by the 35-year-old Andre Iguodala, who finished with 22 points on 9-for-15 shooting.Thursday marked the Warriors’ final game at Oracle Arena before they move to a sparkling new $1bn arena in San Francisco. The crowd was loud, fevered and very vocal. When Thompson shot free throws, they chanted “Game 6, Klay!” After a video tribute to Durant, they chanted “K-D, K-D.” When Curry shot free throws, they yelled “M-V-P! M-V-P!” And when Curry signaled for them to make noise, they roared.But none of it mattered. It was the Raptors’ night, and they earned it every second of the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one.

A bottle shortage swept the country due to the rate at which beer was being consumed to quench the overheated nation’s thirst.But it wasn’t the demand for their classic range of beers that surprised the brewery bosses most, rather the rate at which its alcohol-free varieties were being drunk.Founded in 1827, Störtebeker, which is in the northern port city of Stralsund on Germany’s Baltic coast and built its reputation as a purveyor to holidaying royals, boasts no fewer than three non-alcoholic varieties among its considerable range of beers. Bernstein, a wheat beer, came out in 2007, then followed Frei, an isotonic pils, and the most recent, Atlantic Ale, last August. Its brewers are working on a fourth in their subterranean testing lab, but the details of that are secret.According to the German Association of Brewers (DBB), now as many as one in 15 beers of the estimated annual 6.2 million hectolitres consumed in Germany contains no alcohol. This is being put down to an increase in health awareness as well as an improvement in the quality of a beverage with a reputation for being flat and tasteless, typically drunk only out of necessity.“It’s no longer considered shameful to ask for an alcohol-free beer,” says Marc Oliver Huhnholz of the DBB. “On the contrary, it seems it’s even becoming something of an accepted lifestyle drink and the stigma is more or less gone.”Germany’s 1,500 breweries, he says, now produce between 400 to 500 alcohol-free varieties of beer, with new ones emerging all the time as the brands compete to improve taste, head and consistency.The growth in their popularity has even gone some way to stem a year-on-year fall in standard beer sales.Improvements in both taste and variety and the fact that most bars in Germany will stock at least one type, says Huhnholz, “means that people are increasing enjoying alcohol-free beers out of choice”.In the second, which applies to the Frei and Atlantic, after the completed fermentation process, the beer flows through a closed system and evaporates, with vacuum enabling the ethanol to boil off at a lower temperature. The flavour from the alcohol vapour is added back into the beer to retain its hoppy flavour.Christopher Puttnies, chief brewer at Störtebeker, proudly shows off his gleaming Entalkoholisierungsanlage or de-alcoholisation facility, a 500-metre sea of twisting stainless steel pipes. It’s part of the brewery’s recent multimillion-euro investment programme and, says Puttnies, a reflection of its long-term commitment to alcohol-free varieties, which now make up one in 10 of the brewery’s sales.“We evaporate it as slowly as possible so as to retain the taste as best we can – there’s a lot of technical fine-tuning involved,” he says. This way just 10 hectolitres of beer can be produced an hour, compared to 100 hectolitres for conventional beer. The factory turns out 50,000 half litre bottles of alcohol-free beer a day in addition to 450,000 bottles of its other beers.Factory workers are allowed to drink the non-alcoholic beers as a refreshment during working hours. Increasingly, says Puttnies, the younger ones in particular even drink it off-duty at home. “It’s a far cry from the days when you wouldn’t be seen dead drinking a non-alcoholic beer,” he adds, recalling the first of its kind which was invented in communist East Germany in the early 1970s by a Berlin brewer. It was called AuBi (Auto Bier). “It was like dish water,” Puttnies says.The number of German bars that are increasingly stocking one or more types of alcohol-free beer is on the rise. Only in Spain is the interest in it as high as in Germany. Though not everyone is convinced.His wife, Ellen, wonders what the point is. “You might as well drink water if you’re not going to drink the real thing,” she says.But Rachel Hundt, sitting outside Cafe am Markt drawing on a non-alcoholic pils from a Bavarian brewery, says: “It’s just what I want in this heat. I like the slightly bitter taste and it might be psychological, but I get a buzz. I suppose it’s from the hops.”Bianca Kison, a waiter, says: “I’d estimate that every fourth beer I sell these days is non-alcoholic. That’s a big change even from two, three years ago. Men, women, young, old, even kids like to sip it. There’s no typical customer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c02e4669101d9c2c16b09d02cf9f09422f1cfa/0_14_6099_3659/master/6099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3842caf53e74a98489a69412b5700e48","title":"swiss women strike demand equal pay","story":"Hundreds of thousands protest against ‘culture of sexism in everday life’Hundreds of thousands of women across Switzerland have taken to the streets to demand higher pay, greater equality and more respect, protesting that one of the world’s wealthiest countries continues to treat half its population unfairly.Nearly 30 years after the first nationwide equal rights demonstration by Swiss women, a “purple wave” of pram marches, whistle concerts, extended lunch breaks, giant picnics and city-centre rallies took place on Friday.“In 2019, we are still looking for equality,” Clara Almeida Lozar, one of the committee women organising the Grève des Femmes or Frauenstreik at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, told Swissinfo.“We realise there has to be a lot more than this – the culture of sexism is part of everyday life in Switzerland, it’s invisible, and we are so used to just getting along that we hardly even notice it’s there.”Switzerland lags behind many of its European neighbours in gender equality. Swiss women only got the vote in 1971, decades after most of the western world, and until 1985 needed their husbands’ approval to work or open a bank account.Along with broader anger over sexism and workplace inequality, many demonstrators demanded higher pay specifically for cleaners, teachers, care workers and other jobs more often performed by women.More were expected to join the protest after 3.24pm, the hour at which organisers calculate that women taking home the average monthly wage in Switzerland should stop working in order to earn proportionately as much as men for the day.The first national women’s strike, in 1991, was the biggest industrial action in Swiss history, with more 500,000 women walking out of their jobs to protest against discrimination a decade after sexual equality became law.Many women feel little real progress has been made since. “I think a lot of us thought change would just happen automatically after 1991,” said Marie-Laure Fabre, a temp agency manager. “But it hasn’t and it won’t. This goes very deep it’s structural. We’re going to have to fight for what we deserve.”Events kicked off overnight, with women in Lausanne ringing the bells of the cathedral, which was lit up in purple, lighting a “bonfire of joy” on to which they threw ties and bras, and gathering early on Friday for a breakfast celebration.In Zurich, marchers pulled a giant pink clitoris through the city on a float, while in Basel they projected the clenched-fist feminist symbol on to the headquarters of pharmaceutical firm Roche. In Bern, parliament marked the moment with a 15-minute pause in proceedings.For many, fair wages were a key concern. “Wage equality has not been achieved. That is a good reason to go on strike,” said Ruth Dreyfuss, who became Switzerland’s first female president in 1998. But the global #MeToo movement has encouraged others to attack a wider culture of discrimination and disrespect.“To succeed, any movement needs an emotional energy to it,” the historian Elisabeth Joris told local media. “This energy has now accumulated. There is a huge generation of young women in their 20s and 30s that now favours feminism.”Organisers called upon women to snub housework and to boycott shops and restaurants for the day to help raise awareness about the vital social and economic contribution they make.While some employers said they would not penalise women who took time off work to join the protests, and others actively supported them – including Le Temps newspaper, which left blank spaces where articles written and edited by female journalists would normally appear – many were opposed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3925717.1560513209!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of 40 000 year old ice age wolf found perfectly preserved in russia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA handout picture taken  shows the head of an ancient wolf, discovered in Russia.

Yutaka Katada, the company president, said reports of a mine attack were false.Both vessels suffered explosions, forcing crews to abandon ship and leave them adrift in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran. All crew members were safely evacuated.Navy Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, said the Revolutionary Guard vessel was observed at 4.10pm local time approaching the Kokuka Courageous.He said: It was observed and recorded removing the unexploded limpet mine from the Kokuka Courageous.He added: The United States has no interest in engaging in a new conflict in the Middle East. However, we will defend our interests. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: Taken as a whole these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.Mr Pompeo said American assessment of Iran\u0027s responsibility was based on intelligence sources, the weapons used and the level of expertise, saying no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.In a statement the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Tehran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.It accused the United States and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, of warmongering.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the UK believed the US assessment that Iran was responsible but repeated his warning there was a serious danger of the US and Iran stumbling into an unwanted war. “We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it because they are our closest ally, Mr Hunt told the Today programme. “We are very worried about the situation in Iran because at the moment both sides in this dispute think the other side doesn’t want war and the risk you have is that then they doing something provocative that leads to catastrophic consequences that weren’t intended.” The explosions, which left one of the oil tankers burning outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway, marked the most serious incident since the White House warned in early May that Iran was plotting attacks in the region.    The incident came one month after Iranian forces allegedly used naval mines to blow holes in two oil tankers and two smaller ships off the Emirati port of Fujairah. The US publicly said Iran was behind that attack, while Tehran denied responsibility. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said “suspicious doesn’t begin to describe” the incident in Gulf of Oman. He previously suggested without evidence that Israel was staging the attacks to undermine Iran.   Responding to Mr Zarif\u0027s comments, Mr Pompeo said:  Foreign Minister Zarif may think this is funny but no one else in the world does.The explosions at sea came hours before Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, met with Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on a diplomatic mission intended to try to ease tensions between Iran and the US.But the Japanese leader’s efforts appeared to bear little fruit. Ayatollah Khamenei refused to hear any messages from Donald Trump delivered by Mr Abe, the Iranian government said. The ayatollah also said Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons but “America could not do anything” to stop Tehran if it did decide to pursue a nuclear course. Mr Trump on Thursday ruled out the possibility of making a deal with Iran, saying: While I very much appreciate PM Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!Both tankers were carrying “Japanese-related” cargo, according to Japan’s government. It was not clear if that was a coincidence or if the targeting of the ships was done deliberately to coincide with Mr Abe’s visit to Tehran.   While Iran’s civilian government denies responsibility for any of the attacks, it is possible that the Revolutionary Guard, who answer directly to the supreme leader, are carrying out operations without the government’s knowledge or consent. Iran tries to keep tensions between the two sides concealed but they spilled into the open early this year when Mr Zarif threatened to resign after he was left out of a key meeting while a senior Revolutionary Guard commander was invited.Markets Hub I Brent SpotThe attacks capped six weeks of building tensions between Iran and the US during which time Mr Trump has ordered an aircraft carrier, a bomber taskforce and 1,500 additional troops to the Middle East.  Both the US and Iran say they are not looking for war but Britain and other countries have warned of the danger that the two sides could stumble into an unintended conflict. Antonio Gutteres, the UN secretary general, condemned the attack and warned that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region”. Any fighting near the Strait of Hormuz, the waterway which transports 20 per cent of the world’s oil, would likely cause serious damage to global energy supplies.Analysts said that Iran appeared to be lashing out in order to send a message in response to crippling US sanctions imposed by Mr Trump after he withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think Iran is showing that it has teeth,” said Charles Hollis, a former British diplomat in Tehran who is now managing director of the Falanx Assynt consultancy. “It’s a way of showing that if they are backed into a corner they are not without means of causing grief.” Iran has warned that it will begin enriching high-grade uranium, the kind that could be used for a nuclear weapon, in July unless Europe finds a way to get around US sanctions and prop up the Iranian oil and banking sectors.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I am one of the only people in Parliament who is a genuine specialist.”Mr Stewart studied at Oxford and tutored Princes William and Harry in his spare time.The Home Secretary ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Mr Javid was appointed Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.A known Eurosceptic, he is backing for a harder Brexit.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcs is a former managing director from Deutsche Bank.On May , Javid announced his bid to run for PM.He has vowed to help poor Brits rise up.The former Brexit Secretary quit the cabinet in protest over Theresa Mays soft orce deal with the EU.Raab has insisted No Deal wouldnt be chaotic for Britain and said the short-term risks were manageable.He has blasted those who want to extend Article  or a second referendum.He said: If theres an attempt to reverse the referendum, stop Brexit altogether I think that would cut across not only the democratic mandate, the biggest in history we had.Raab has vowed to slash taxes by £ for millions of low-paid Brits with National Insurance shake-up.Theresa May stepped down as Tory leader without delivering Brexit and with her party on the verge of extinction.May claimed she had done all she could to take Britain out of the EU with a deal, saying: Ever since I first stepped through the door behind me as Prime Minister, I have striven to make the United Kingdom a country that works not just for a privileged few, but for everyone. And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, they have all been produced and distributed by the BBC’s rivals.This week there was uproar after the BBC announced that over-s will now lose the right to their free TV licence, saving around £m per year.And we all know where theyll be splashing this cash - chasing the elusive youth market whove turned away from the BBC in their droves in favour of online streaming services like Netflix, Now TV, and Amazon Prime Video.But as a -year-old who ditched their licence fee last year - instead Im a fully paid-up member of Generation Netflix - I can tell them theyre going about it all wrong.For young people like me, it’s clear that the BBC is stuck in the past. In fact, it’s so out-of-touch that it still offers a discount for anyone whose TV only works in black and white.It’s easy to see how the Beeb’s snooty tone and we-know-best attitude earned it the nickname ‘Auntie’. Today it is more patronising than ever.Lets look at the youth-oriented BBC Three.In an attempt to appeal to young audiences, the channel focuses on niche, politically-correct content, with the latest hits including a show about a niqab-wearing parachutistand an article praising “eco warriors”.The crusty old relic BBC is trying to appear cool and relevant to the youth - but it has been duped into thinking that loud, hysterical snowflakes are representative of an entire generation.It’s clear that the BBC thinks all young people are Jeremy Corbyn-loving lefties so has skewed its content to be hyper left-wing and social justice-oriented to reflect that, when in reality we have erse opinions. Whisper it, but some of us are even right-wing.And BBC Three’s toe-curling Twitter account is a prime example of how not to communicate with young people.The account has done away with grammar entirely, and whoever runs it communicates almost exclusively in gs. Presumably, they think that’s how we all talk, but it’s not cool or edgy… it’s just awkward.Another part of the BBC’s problem is that younger people just don’t consume news and TV the same way as our parents and grandparents.While older people may be happy to wait for the news headlines on TV, we prefer to get our information on demand, via online news sites.Social media outstrips TV as the main news source for young people, with  per cent of - year olds getting their headline fix that way.These websites are less dry than the stale BBC coverage, and at least with other publications you know up-front what their biases are – they don’t pretend to be impartial while peddling a lefty editorial line like the BBC.Just look at todays BBC news headlines for examples of how dull the news can be.Less-than-riveting articles on the site include “How to cope with email overload”, alongside a piece about whether your dining room table was made from illegally-sourced wood and what your bedroom says about you. It’s not exactly gripping, public-interest journalism.In trying to be everything to everyone, the BBC is failing to satisfy anyone - certainly not young people.And it’s not just their online output which shows it up. Just compare what the rest of the BBC is showing to what’s on offer by its rivals.Netflix is currently airing new episodes of the excellent sci-fi series Black Mirror, while Sky Go viewers are going mad for nuclear disaster drama, Chernobyl.Meanwhile, the top shows on BBC iPlayer at the moment include dramas like Casualty and repeats of ancient comedies like Blackadder.And on TV tonight, while ITV has us swooning at Love Island, the BBC will be airing Holby City, Springwatch and… more repeats – this time of Live At The Apollo. Yawn.While these shows may be popular with older audiences, it’s clear that there just isn’t much there for young people.When you can stream a library of millions of shows on a laptop or tablet, it feels a bit backwards to sit down and subject yourself to a TV schedule which someone  has decided for you.Of course, it would be unfair to say that the BBC doesn’t do anything right. Fleabag, Killing Eve and Bodyguard have all proved to be very popular.But the question is: why do we all have to pay for these shows evenwe have no intention of watching them While BBC viewers are forced by law to fork out £. per year for the privilege of owning a TV, Netflix customers can pay as little as £. per year to access an ever-growing library of top-tier tele.Amazon Prime Video is similarly priced at £ per year, while Now TV will set you back £.. Sky is more expensive, but you can still find packages for £ per month.It’s no wonder that Brits are turning away from the Beeb, with nearly a million of us cancelling our licence fees every year in favour of cheaper alternatives.Surely a subscription model, like Amazon Prime or Netflix, would be a fairer way to pay for BBC TV.By scrapping the licence fee for everyone, we could force the BBC – supposedly a public service broadcaster – to actually serve the public.Until then, I’ll stick to Netflix.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As it should.The BBC is insisting that this was a “tough decision to take”. And thatthey didn’t do it, they’d have to close some channels down.Really  How about sacking Gary Lineker  Does he really deserve almost million quid a year for whining about Brexit and telling you what’s coming next on Match Of The Day There are plenty more big-star salaries that could be sacriced, too.But how about getting rid of the vast swathe of middle managers in the BBC When I was a journo there I had to answer to about  bosses, most of who were inept and who usually disagreed with each other. More bosses than you could shake a stick at.There’s , people working for the BBC. If you got rid of a few thousand middle managers the output would improve and they’d have easily saved their money.Director-Generals always say they’re going to cut down on the middle managers. They never do.Director-Generals also say they’re going to spend less on consultants. Lord Hall promised precisely this. But last year they INCREASED that spending to £.million.Or how about they close down the BBC’s online service, which competes against commercial organisations and is utterly unnecessary This is the problem — well, one problem — with the Beeb. It over-reaches. It’s meant to make nice radio and TV programmes we might all enjoy. But that’s long forgotten.It now tries to do everything. And it tramples on commercial organisations which don’t have a yearly licence fee to support their grandiose schemes.Have a look at the web page for BBC jobs. They’re asking for architects, data scientists and resource schedulers.I haven’t a clue what a resource scheduler is, but I bet the BBC could get by without one. And architects This is all a real own goal by the BBC. More and more people are sick to the back teeth of its relentless political bias, its political correctness and the lack of decent stuff you might want to watch or hear.Truth is, it shouldn’t be just the pensioners who should be excused paying the licence fee.It is time it was removed from the rest of us as well.It’s long outlived its usefulness.SO, Boris has unveiled his leadership bid.Lower taxes and a definite exit from the European Union by October .I’ve always had my doubts about Boris as a Prime Minister.

Rescue operation almost completed, reports the Mirror.Both the Norwegian-owned ship and the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous experienced explosions on Thursday morning forcing crews to evacuate in waters between Gulf Arab states and Iran.While it was reported that the Altair was struck by a torpedo, it now appears that both tankers were attacked with limpet mines although the exact cause of the blasts has not been officially confirmed, Reuters reports.The incident has inflamed tensions between the United States and Iran.Yesterday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Tehran for the blatant attacks while the Pentagon released images and footage as proof of Iranian involvement.Pompeo said the attacks were part of a campaign of escalating tension by Iran which pose a threat to international peace and security.It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today, Pompeo told reporters.This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.“Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security,” he said.Pompeo said the United States will defend its forces and interests in the region but gave no specics about any plans and he took no questions.Hours later it was revealed the US Navy is sending the guided missile destroyer USS Mason to the scene of the attacks.However, a senior Iranian official told the BBC: Iran has no connection with the incident.And the hardline Islamic nation also described claims it was to blame as Iranophobic.It said: Iran categorically denies the US unfounded claims with regard the  June oil tanker incidents and condemns it in the strongest terms possible.Neither fabrications and disinformation campaigns nor shamelessly blaming others can change the realities.The US and its regional allies must stop warmongering and put an end to mischievous plots as well as  flag operations in the region.Earlier one US source dismissed the Islamic Republic’s earlier claim that they had rescued all the crew members from both ships branding the report “patently .”He said the USS Bainbridge had rescued  of the  stricken sailors involved in the incident near the Strait of Hormuz.Earlier, Tehrans news agency IRNA claimed Iranian search and rescue teams had taken all the crew members to the port of Jask.The Panama-flagged Kokuka Courageous is believed to have been targeted by a magnetic mine causing a series of massive explosions on board.The United States has video and photos that show an Iranian navy boat removing an unexploded mine attached to the hull of the Japanese-owned chemical tanker, reports CNN.Norwegian shipping firm Frontline, which owns the Altair, has denied Iranian reports that the tanker had sunk.The ship was built in  and is flagged to the Marshall Islands - a US associated state in the Pacic Ocean.Chartered by Taiwans state oil refiner CPC Corp, the huge vessel set sail from the UAE port of Ruwais on Tuesday and was due to arrive in Kaohsiung on June .Speaking to Reuters, the CEO of CPCs petrochemical ision Wu I-Fang said the tanker was suspected of being hit by a torpedo.He said it was carrying , tonnes of naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock, which trade sources estimate to be worth more than  million.Paolo dAmico, chairman of the tanker association, Intertanko, said concern was rising for other crews braving the powder keg shipping lanes.He said: If the waters are becoming unsafe, the oil supply to the entire Western world could be at risk.”It comes as tensions in the Persian Gulf between the United States and Iran are threatening to reach boiling point.A Saudi-led coalition has described todays attack as a major escalation.In recent weeks, Washington has sent a number of battle ships to the region in response to what it says are Iranian threats against American interests and its allies in the region.The Kokuka Courageous - which is owned by Japanese firm Kokuka Sangyohad - set sail from Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia on June  and was due to reach Singapore by June .Oil prices rose by . per cent following news of the explosions, according to reports.Irans foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zar branded the explosions as suspicious calling them reported attacks on Japan-related oil tankers.He said the incident had happened as Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei was meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a close American ally.The US Navys th Fleet said it is aware of a reported attack in the area and is investigating.A statement said: US naval forces in the region received two separate distress calls at . am local time and a second one at . am.US Navy ships are in the area and are rendering assistance.Speaking about the attacks, White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said: “The President has been briefed on the attack on ships in the Gulf of Oman.“The US Government is providing assistance and will continue to assess the situation.”The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is run by the British Navy, urged extreme caution and said it was investigating the incident.“We are deeply concerned by reports of explosions and fires on vessels in the Gulf of Oman.

The Government would do whatever it takes to “keep people safe,” she said. Tomorrow marks the second anniversary of the fire that cost the lives of  people. Two years on tens of thousands of people are still living in unsafe buildings, families are still waiting to the rehoused and fire service funding has been cut. That is why the Daily Mirror has launched its “Grenfell, Never Again” campaign. We are calling for dangerous cladding to be removed from all buildings, the reversal of cuts to fire authorities, sprinklers to be fitteddeemed advisable, an independent regulator to champion tenants’ rights and for an independent authority to oversee the fire service.  Grenfell United’s Karim Mussilhy told the Mirror: “It’s unbelievable that in modern Britain, two years after Grenfell, people are still living in homes that are not fit and buildings that are not safe.” The Government’s own figures show that there are still  high rise and public buildings still clad in the same aluminium compositematerial used on Grenfell Tower. This includes  residential blocks,  hotels and  student accommodation buildings. A further , buildings, including  high rises, are clad in other potentially combustible buildings such as high pressure laminate.    This includes , buildings like hospitals, care homes, schools and hotels that have flammable exteriors but are not high rises. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government says ACM cladding has been removed from  buildings since the fire. Grenfell survivors have warned that a “Grenfell Two” is “in the post” because of the Government’s failure to act. Two years after the fire some former residents are still waiting for a permanent home. Of the  households from Grenfell,  remain in temporary accommodation. Fire safety regulations have not been updated and their call for an independent regulator to protect tenants remains unanswered.  “The problem is that it has become increasingly clear than in most cases, those in power simply aren’t interested in acting on our concerns,” said Grenfell United, which represents survivors, in a briefing published to mark the second anniversary of the tragedy. In the wake of the deadly fire in Lakanal House, south London, in  the coroner wrote to the then Communities Secretary Eric Pickles recommending the government encourage the retrofitting of sprinklers in high-rise flats. Despite the call only  out of  council-run tower blocks above mhave sprinklers and only  of the  new build schools. In the last three years every single fire authority has seen a cut in the amount it receives in central government funding. In -, the government spent £,million on fire services. But in -, it will only spend £million. The cuts range from % in Greater Manchester to % in Warwickshire. In Manchester this has seen the number of its firefighters cut by %.

The Coroner’s report into the deadly  Lakanal House fire recommended sprinklers should be retrofitted into all social housing.Only  out of  council tower blocks above mhave sprinklers and only  of the  new build schools. We urgently need all blocks to be made safe, including fitting or upgrading fire safety doors. The Mirror believes sprinklers should be retrofitted when deemed necessary by a risk assessment.

Tenants’ right should be strengthened and democratically-elected groups should be given a direct say on the running and upkeep of their buildings to counter the lobbying by the construction industry.  Reverse the cuts to the firefighter numbers and Fire Safety Officers In -, the government spent £,m on fire services.

New independent national body to oversee standards and best practices in fire service across the country The fragmentation of the fire service means there is no national body to oversee fire and rescue service and fire policy.A new independent national body should be set up with oversight of all fire service professionals, including the FBU, fire chiefs, fire engineers, and fire researchers.This means standards y across authorities and lessons are not being learned. Minimum standards should be set for response times and crewing levels. The number of fire safety officers has fallen from  in  to  in . As a result, the number of inspections has fallen from , audits in England in - to , in - - a fall of %. The FBU says there should a new independent authority to oversee the fire service and minimum standards set for crewing and response times. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: “After a decade of austerity, the fire and rescue service is hanging by a thread. With slowing response times and massive cuts to firefighter jobs, a sprinkler system, where appropriate, could make the crucial dference, saving a building from complete destruction.“ “Warnings from residents of unsafe conditions at Grenfell fell on deaf ears. Grenfell was a tragedy born from years of neglect and a community abandoned by the political establishment.  “We need to end the persistent brutal cuts to the fire and rescue service. One in five firefighter jobs have been slashed, fire stations have been closed and crewing levels have been reduced. Resources have been stretched thin, leaving communities exposed. “Fire safety officers are essential to catching dangerous fire risks early on. Massive cuts to their numbers and creeping interventions from the private sector are leaving risks like those at Grenfell unnoticed.” Campaign group JusticeGrenfell was set up in the chaotic days following the tragedy, and is working to provide justice for the bereaved, survivors, those evacuated and the wider community. Backing the Mirror campaign, group co-ordinator Yvette Williams said: “It’s the second anniversary of the fire at Grenfell Tower. We have got a delay in the inquiry and no recommendations for change have been made - and there are things that should be done urgently to save further loss of le. “The things the Daily Mirror is raising around the removal of cladding, the installation of sprinklers and the need for resources for the fire service are urgent needs and need to be implemented now rather than waiting another one or two years down the line. “This does not just effect the Grenfell community but has an impact across the entire nation.”  The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan , also backed the Mirror’s campaign. He said: “Two years on from the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower, the Government’s lack of action is utterly shameful: the local community feels ignored, there are still people whose homes were destroyed living in emergency and temporary accommodation, and building regulations are still unfit for purpose. Residents in blocks of flats across London and the rest of the country continue to live in fear that their homes are unsafe. I welcome the Mirror’s campaign to hold ministers to account and urge them to adopt these changes.” A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “There is nothing more important than supporting those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy and making sure the lessons are learnt so this never happens again. “We’ve allocated £milion for the removal and replacement of dangerous ACM cladding on high-rise homes and are working with councils to ensure this work is completed. “We have issued unambiguous advice to building owners  months ago to reinforce existing building safety requirements and tell building owners what to do to make sure their cladding system is safe. This advice was updated in December .”  Our petition demands  Remove inflammable cladding from all tower blocks and public buildings.

Mia Davies was in another room on Tuesday when she heard -month-old Albert Brierley begin to cry and ran to investigate. As the mum-of-two rushed into the living room, she watched in horror as three-year-old Violet dropped a huge ball of slime on her brotheraposs head while giggling. In a panic, the -year-old tried to scoop the slime off Albertaposs delicate hair, but ended up dropping it and staining the sofa in the process.    With boisterous Violet chuckling in the background, Mia desperately tried water, shampoo and conditioner on Albertaposs hair - but it caused the slime to solidy. In her next attempt, she used a bottle of olive oil and a soft brush to try and free his hair of the glittery substance. Although the majority of the slime came away, the poor little boy was forced to live with crusty bits still in his hair the next day. Upon being confronted over her mischief, Violet admitted sheaposd put slime in his hair but said she had been trying to be a aposhair sprayerapos. Mia, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, said: At first I thought it was a bit comical, but when I couldnapost get it out of his hair I just felt panic.    My advice to all parents: do not leave slime unattended! I went into the living room and Violet just slapped it on his head. It stuck instantly. As I tried to pick it out, it was just pulling the baby hair out of his head.  Albert was crying, bless him, but Violet still found it funny. I tell her off but she denies sheaposs done things - evensheaposs done it in front of me. I put Albert into the bath and I tried to wash it at first but that didnapost work - the water caused it to harden in his hair. Then I used conditioner and that didnapost work either. So in the end I used olive oil which helped release it and used a soft brush to gently comb it out. He was very oily after that.    She added: In the future, arts and crafts will be at the table only. My partner was not happy one bit because it went everywhere. Big sister Violet had recently been gted some slime for her birthday and despite her dad Chris, , being wary, her mum had allowed her to play with it in the living room. Mia said: Slime is quite popular in our house. Violet got loads of it for her birthday and my partner kept telling me not to give it to her. The next day little Albert still had bits of the dried-up slime stuck in his hair - but his determined mum has now finally picked out the remainder. Mia has since had to admit she was wrong and will be forced to bin the rest of her slime. She said: The slime still isnapost in the bin. It should be. I will be putting it in the bin. Violet and Albert get on really well and do love each other.

Corrie, originally from Dunfermline, Scotland, was serving in the RAF at nearby Honington and was last seen walking the streets alone following a night out. It was believed he may have fallen into a bin and been taken to a landfill site, but extensive searches of the area proved fruitless.    Suffolk Police announced last March there were no realistic lines of enquiry left to pursue and the investigation would move to the cold case team. There is nothing to suggest any foul play or third party involvement, the force said in a statement.Corrieaposs dad, Martin McKeague, later revealed he had  accepted his son was no longer missing . Now Nicola Urquhart, , from Dunfermline, has taken to the Find Corrie Facebook page to share photos of her son and said she hasnapost given up the search. I am not sure where to start with this post as sadly I have no real update to post, she said. For all those sending me, my sons and family lovely messages letting us know you still care, it honestly does mean the world to me and us. I have no update to give you from the MIT team at Suffolk that were investigating Corrieaposs disappearance. It is my opinion the gave up the day they finished searching the landfill.  Since it was handed over to the cold case team I have heard nothing from them and to be honest, I never expected too as I was told they had too many cold cases to do anything with Corrie. This does not mean that I havenapost been doing things myself. When I can post any kind of update I will. Thank you all for being such positive, kind people youaposre amazing. Nicolaaposs post on Sunday came two days before the daughter Corrie never got to meet celebrated her second birthday.  Corrieaposs girlfriend April Oliver, gave birth to Ellie-Louise Corrie Oliver on June  in . It will also be the second Fatheraposs Day the pair will not have Corrie to celebrate with on Sunday. Nicola also shared some snaps of Corrie and wrote: Corrie, always loving and living every moment in le. Something we should all do. Le on this earth is so very precious x. On another she wrote: This is a photo of what I can only describe as pure happiness. This is Corrie, Darroch and Connor. A very true friend.  Sometimes people criticise the young people today for living their lives taking photographs but sometimes this, along with our memories is all we have. But they are beautul, happy memories. We cant change the past but we can learn from it. Be kind. Love, be positive. Connor, you are loved x x x x. Meanwhile, police revealed more than , people had been spoken to during the inquiry, more than , hours of CCTV looked at,  statements taken, as well as extensive searches. Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott said last year: It is extremely disappointing that we have not been able to find Corrie. I can only imagine the strain Corrie’s family have been under over the past  months and I thank them for their patience and understanding.  Whilst the investigation has drawn to a natural conclusion we will continue to work with the family to provide answers to their questions and help them understand what may have happened. Since Corrie disappeared, police have been exploring all proportionate and relevant lines of enquiry. We have now reached a point where we are unable to make any further progress, and have gone as far as we realistically can with the information we have. If any new, credible and proportionate enquiries relating to Corrie’s disappearance emerge we will pursue them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple face losing 30k dream","story":"NewsCouple face losing £k on dream wedding as May bank holiday moved to FridayAnthony Messore and Jess Howells say they will be forced to cover the costs of around  missing guests now unable to make the trip to Baia Domizia in ItalyShareCommentsByAdam HaleKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUN NewsAnthony Messore and Jess Howells face losing up to £, \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bride and groom say their dream wedding abroad is in ruins after next yearaposs May bank holiday was moved from a Monday to a Friday. Anthony Messore and Jess Howells face losing up to £, as family and friends are now unable to make the trip. They fear they will be forced to cover the costs of around  missing guests for their fairy tale wedding at an Italian seaside village. The couple is due to tie the knot at a venue set on a private beach in Baia Domizia, around one hour from Naples, the birthplace of Mr Messoreaposs father who died five years ago.    The wedding, which has been booked for two years, is set for Sunday May  next year, with the idea that the original Bank Holiday Monday would prevent guests having to miss work and school before ing home. But their plans have been thrown into turmoil after the Government moved next yearaposs May Day bank holiday back by four days to Friday May  to coincide with the th anniversary of VE Day. Mr Messore, , who owns his own electronics business, said: There are a lot of teachers in our family, including my brotheraposs we, two of my cousins, and everyone had used the bank holiday to work out they could come. Now they canapost because they wonapost be able to get the time off. My brotheraposs we has already said she doesnapost think she will be coming. That means my brother may not come.    Itaposs going to break Jessaposs heart, because her sister, who is a nurse, isnapost going to be able to come. Weaposve got a big family, and a lot of the kids are still in school, so they wonapost be able to make it, andthe kids canapost make it then the parents canapost come too. A lot of people have said they canapost make it. Iaposve now got a lot of rooms in the hotel that are going to be empty because Iaposve paid up front for them. There is probably  to  guests unable to come, possibly more, and also the amount could run into £, to £,. Itaposs spoiling our wedding, and of course I canapost cancel it because I wonapost be able to get my money back. Mr Messore stressed his frustration lies with the Government and not those involved in the VE Day anniversary, saying: Donapost get me wrong, we would not be hereit wasnapost for the guys who gave their lives for us. But how it could be changed with just  months to go is beyond me. Youaposd think the Government would know beforehand when the VE celebrations would be, theyaposve had  of them.    The couple, from Cwmbran, South Wales, have been together for seven years, and had originally invited  guests to their wedding, which has already cost around £,. Ms Howells, a nursery teacher and mother to son Jayden, , said: As a girl Iaposve dreamt of this special day all my le, and my fairy tale wedding was planned. Now by a Government decision with the change of date, everything could be so dferent and completely spoil our dream day. If a simple alternative could be put in place, like an extra bank holiday added, then this wouldnapost be such an issue for us and our family. So much will have to be changed, big amounts of money lost, the memories we will make wonapost be as perfect as it could be, with special family being made absent because of this, and itaposs completely out of our hands. The decision to change the day of the traditional May bank holiday has only been done once before, when it was moved in  to coincide with the th anniversary of VE Day.

This Airbus aircraft is the first to be built at the Filton site in Bristol since Concorde and has already taken its first flight. Footage shows its flapping wings as it takes off from the ground. The scale-model plane is the first to have flapping wing tips - and could transform aircraft wing design. Airbus engineers drew on nature to develop the apossemi-aeroelastic hingeapos concept to reduce drag and overall wing weight, while combating the effects of turbulence and wind gusts. It has been built with carbonfibre and glassfibre-reinforced polymers, as well as components from additive-layer manufacturing. The team will now carry out further testing before the demonstrator plane, based on the manufactureraposs A aircraft, is scaled up further.    Airbus engineer Tom Wilson, who is based in Filton, explained: While hinged wing-tips are not new, military jets employ them to allow greater storage capacity on aircraft carriers. The Airbus demonstrator is the first aircraft to trial in-flight, freely flapping wing-tips to relieve the effects of wind gusts and turbulence. We drew inspiration from nature, the albatross marine bird locks its wings at the shoulder for long-distance soaring but unlocks them when wind-gusts occur or maneuvering is required.    Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbusapos executive vice-president of engineering, says the project shows how nature can inspire us. He said: When there is a wind gust or turbulence, the wing of a conventional aircraft transmits huge loads to the fuselage, so the base of the wing must be heavily strengthened, adding weight to the aircraft. Allowing the wing-tips to react and flex to gusts reduces the loads and allows us to make lighter and longer wings. The longer the wing, the less drag it creates up to an optimum, so there are potentially more fuel efficiencies to exploit.  The first test flights of the AlbatrossOne demonstrator took place earlier this year after a -month development programme. Initial testing examined the planeaposs stability with the wing tips locked and unlocked. The next step is to conduct further tests to combine the two modes, allowing the wing-tips to unlock during flight and to examine the transition, engineer James Kirk added. The team presented their research at the International Forum on Aeroelasticity and Structural Dynamics conference in the United States this week.

After a string of TV appearances he was about to be awarded his first Michelin star and was planning to open his second restaurant. But when his we, Adele, noticed an unusual blister on the white of his eye, Timaposs whole world fell apart.He was diagnosed with melanoma , a type of skin cancer, in his eye in March .Adele, now , said: “I’d noticed it had grown bigger, but Tim didn’t actually go to the doctor for that – he went about four weeks later after pulling his back and asked them to take a look at it.    “Within hours I’d had a call from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield saying he needed to go to their eye unit immediately. “We were in a huge panic. Everything was a bit of a whirlwind, because at that stage we were also in the process of opening a new fine dining restaurant in Hepworth. “He had a biopsy and within days he had the cancer diagnosis. He had a tumour which was diagnosed as melanoma on the white of his eye.” Tim, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, had sold his house in  to buy The Butcheraposs Arms in Hepworth.    While risky, it was a good decision as the restaurant was soon winning awards. Dad-of-two Tim had appeared twice on BBCaposs Great British Menu, was preparing to buy his second restaurant and a Michelin star was within his grasp. He said: “My vision was fine because it was on the white of my eye rather than the retina. Surgeons removed the tumour and  to  per cent of the white of my eye, which they then re-stitched with a baby’s placenta. “I’d always thought cancer wouldn’t happen to me so my attitude was that they’d removed the tumour and I’d carry on as normal. The next day I was back to getting the restaurant ready.”    He refused to let his cancer diagnosis stop his plans and in June  opened The Spiced Pear, also in Hepworth. But  months after his initial diagnosis he found a hard lump on the left side of his face. His consultant at Sheffieldaposs Royal Hallamshire Hospital confirmed in August  that the melanoma had ed. Tim had to endure an eight hour operation to remove the lump, half his saliva glands and some lymph nodes. Tim, who had the left side of his face stapled up afterwards, said: “There’s no other way to describe it – I looked like the elephant man.” Six gruelling weeks of intense radiotherapy followed, with him having to travel for two hours every day for treatment, while farm manager Adele tried to keep the restaurants ticking over.  Tim said: “It was like putting my head into a microwave. The first couple of weeks were okay but between week three and seven it was horrendous, Tim recalled. “My mouth was covered in ulcers. I couldn’t swallow. Speaking became impossible. Imagine how hard it is to eat with one ulcer and times that by a thousand. They were spreading down my throat. “I lost  per cent of my taste. Everything I tried had the taste and texture of cardboard. “It’s like being a carpenter, wood is your tool, and for me being a chef my mouth is my tool, so not being able to use it was absolutely devastating.”  Normally weighing  stone, within six weeks of surgery Timaposs weight had dropped to nine stone. After losing his hair because of radiotherapy he was unrecognisable. Unable to eat and struggling to get out of bed some days, he relied on high calorie supplements from the hospital for nutrition, but became extremely dehydrated, so doctors threatened him with a feeding tube. Tim said: “I thought, ‘I’m a chef and that’s not going to happen.’ I knew I had to do something and I thought about how much I had to live for – my beautul we and children - and that made me more determined. I’d been given a second chance. “I was eating pureed food and slowly introducing lumps. It took four months from my operation to being able to eat properly.  “It was very hard, because we had The Spiced Bear and a Michelin star was my ultimate goal but I knew I had to concentrate on myself and my health. Knowing I might not taste again and being so close to achieving so much was very tough.” Gradually his sense of taste ed, with the turning point being a holiday in Padstow, Cornwall, when he ate scallops with lime, chilli and coriander at the Prawn on the Lawn restaurant. Tim said: “It was the first time my taste ed, when I tasted lime and coriander. I actually started crying. I couldn’t believe it. It was an emotional moment and a turning point.” Having sold his first restaurant in  to concentrate on The Spiced Pear Tim then took the decision to sell up again in June  to concentrate on his health.  He spent a few months recovering from the physical and emotional impact of the radiotherapy. Then in July , determined to continue in the profession he loved, he was offered a job at a local tourist attraction, Cannon Hall Farm near Barnsley, where he still works today. Adele said: “Timaposs le had changed and he was no longer in the big chef world, but he was really happy and just wanted me and the boys to be okay. “He was cancer free and was ing to the hospital for check ups every six months, with everything looking fine. “But it was Christmas last year that he started to get a pain in his knee which he put down to an old footballing injury. “It got worse and in January he went to his GP who sent him for some scans. We had no idea it would be linked to cancer.”   But clear for nearly three years, Tim, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, felt confident he had beaten it, only to discover cancer in his left leg and kidney in December which, at stage four, is incurable.  Tim was phoned by his doctor, who told him there was a tumour in his left knee, running down his leg. He said: It was like a steam train had come and knocked me sideways.” A further biopsy at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham in April confirmed the original melanoma had spread to the bones in his legs and later his kidney. At stage four, it was incurable. Under the care of Weston Park Hospital in Sheffield, Tim is now receiving dual immunotherapy treatment, which activates the immune system to attack the cancer cells.  This can only prolong his le and has led to inflammation of the liver. Adele said: “It was completely heart-breaking news. This cancer is such an aggressive thing and moves so quickly. “Tim’s reaction was, ‘Cut off my leg,’ but by the time theyaposd done that, it could have spread somewhere . “We don’t knowthe immunotherapy will work, but without it he was given  months. While they have been honest with their children about the prognosis, Tim said they are now trying to live as normally as possible. He added: “You can do what you want in our house but there’s one rule we live by and that is we don’t lie to each other. We’ve been completely open and honest with the boys. “They know their dad will be fighting this until his last breath. “We’re being as normal as possible. I’m not sitting in a rocking chair at home saying, ‘Why me ’ I’m still going to work and taking the boys to football and cricket.”  In the meantime, Tim has a wishlist, which includes taking Adele and their boys, Henry, , and Charlie, seven to New York, where they celebrated their honeymoon, and seeing his sons lead his beloved Leeds United on the pitch as mascots. Having hidden away during his second diagnosis, he has also set up a blog to update people on his progress, stressing the importance of talking. Tim, who has been overwhelmed by his family and friendsapos support - having received well wishes from celebrity chefs including Raymond Blanc and Tom Kerridge - added: “The blog allows me to update everyone on what’s happening and I’ve actually found it very therapeutic. I always wanted to help other men and let them know itaposs okay to speak out. Now people are not phoning us asking for updates, they can just read that. People won’t come and ask how I am now but will come up and give me a cuddle.”To follow Tim’s blog visit."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast scorching heatwave","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Scorching heatwave tobut only after weekend washoutThe country will be pounded by rain this weekend, although Brits can look forward to a heatwave next weekShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video met-office-national-weather-forecast-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain is braced for a washout this weekend, ahead of a summer heatwave next week.

People who judge polyamorous couples need to realise that we are people just like them. We have the same love for our family.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit.

All classes are extremely close, with everything to ride for.#As always, we hope to put on great show for everyone who comes along to watch and support the racing.

Help offered by TSI might involve governance, fundraising and managing volunteers.With the closing of two TSI projects, the Guided Self-Help project and the Self-Directed Supporton September  last year, TSI has shted its approach to dealing with charities and vulnerable people.In a move that has seen six members of staff made redundant across Argyll and Bute and offices closing in Oban and, most recently, Lochgilphead, TSI has been criticised for taking staff #off the front line#.In a statement, TSI chief executive Kirsteen Murray said: #All staff affected by potential redundancy in the over-staffed areas were offered the opportunity to apply for vacant posts within the project.#Unfortunately we said goodbye to one full-time member of staff and two part-time at the end of September .#TSI has introduced a central telephone number and email address, a   self-serve facility on its website and travelling surgeries with  surgeries planned in Argyll and Bute across .Kirsteen Murray continued: #The feedback we have had has been excellent. Small numbers of organisations are accessing the self-serve facility and giving us positive feedback. Similarly, surgeries have proved popular in rural areas where small organisations appreciate us travelling to them.#Lochgilphead charities, though, have either not been informed of the change or claim the service is inadequate.Sandra Johnston, chairperson of four Mid Argyll charitable groups and a committee member of another three, said she had not been informed of the new phone line or website. She added: #The point of the TSI is to support local groups, which isn#t happening.#With them keeping on one member of staff in Lochgilphead # without any phone or office -there are no people to support the groups. The hands-on practical support isn#t there. It#s a very bad situation.##They have told me nothing. Between seven groups, I#ve not heard anything.#Common sense would tell them to send out letters to all the local groups. But they don#t understand who they#re working with. I#m lucky because I have people around me who can use a computer, some people don#t.#Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand said: #It is disappointing and concerning that TSI has closed its office in Lochgilphead, particularly when government legislation is becoming ever more dependent on TSI to provide services.#"},{"url":null,"title":"mural-makeover-for-galashiels-building-site","story":"SCHOOL

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

I believe that the current cemetery is starting to near capacity so it is important that we see the new cemetery open soon.Fellow ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell added: ldquoAs the community grows, we need to plan for more burial capacity in Prestonpans.ldquoThere are still people who want to be buried following their death, and I know that being laid to rest in the place you love is really important to people."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-cockenzie-and-port-seton-gala-2019","story":"This year, Grace Mearns will be crowned Seton Queen on Saturday, ahead of a fun-packed day for all the family.The fancy dress parade assembles at the Port Seton Centre at am and then sets off through the village at noon.The laying of the wreath at the war memorial takes place at .pm before the royal party heads to Cockenzie Harbour.At pm, the Queenrsquos Barge sets out to sea and, after a brush with the pirates, lands safely at Port Seton Harbour at .pm before processing to King George V Park to arrive at pm.The funfair will be up and running in the park from noon onwards, with fairground rides and stalls, and the committee have asked people to remember that the attractions will only be accepting cash this year.The crowning ceremony is set to start at pm.

The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  BBC   s disgraceful excesses have brought about this sorry mess","story":"As the BBC announces that from June  it will end free TV licences for over-s who do not receive pension credit, nostalgia for the Beeb of old will be tinged not just with regret but a sense of betrayal. Of course there will be thousands of this vintage who can cough up pound without a second thought, barely denting their cruise-ship budget or round-the-world jaunts. But we should be in no doubt there are just as many who, eventhey do not qualy for pension credit, will have to cut back on other essentials in order to secure this leline. And beyond them, hidden in the shadows, are those in serious poverty, who are too proud, too isolated or too uninformed, to apply for benefits they are due.The argument over whether the licence fee should be free for the elderly, however, is not, and should never be, entirely about affordability. It is a question of principle. We live in an age in which digital entertainment and news provision has become a Wild West frontier, offering myriad possibilities for those with access to online services, the skill to navigate them, and the cash to pay. Netflix, Sky, Amazon Prime and others all clamour for custom, chipping away at the BBCrsquos once-monolithic status. For a business with a glut of extremely well-paid captains at the helm, the corporation has been astonishingly slow to recognise the threat viewersrsquo changing habits pose to its future.I doubt there is anyone under  who would not blithely go where without a momentrsquos regret. Doubtless they already wonder why they should pay a licence on top of other subscription fees, especially when they can also stream much of what they want for free. But those who are over , who grew up with John Reithrsquos dream, are umbilically attached. The BBC schedule is the clock around which their day is constructed, be it The Archers, Test Match Special, the Six OrsquoClock News, or The Antiques Roadshow. Without this devoted audience, the BBC would have shrivelled long ago. It is to these stalwarts that Lord Reithrsquos baby owes its existence, and its prestige. To turf them overboard when money grows tight is not just disgraceful, it makes no sense.Announcing this decision, in the tones of a funeral director sorry for their loss, the BBC Chairman and Director-General explained the arithmetic in such a way that it seems there is no alternative. The end of Government funding for free licences will leave a pound million hole in its bank account. The alternative, they said, would be to close stations such as BBC Two and Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland Channel and Radio  Live, among others, all of which, clearly, is deemed unthinkable.Read more: Tories accused of broken promise in free TV licence rowYet the time for the unthinkable is not today. It was not even four years ago, when Westminster gave notice of pulling its subsidy. The moment for a strategic rethink and recalibration was  and more years ago. At that point, the exponential expansion of digital s was already transforming peoplersquos relationship with screen and sound. This was when the BBC needed to look hard at its role and purpose and come up with a remodelled, leaner profile, fit for a new century. Instead, it has continued to expand, astomorrow will never arrive.Many of the over-s, a generation bred to thrt, will be puzzled by the Beebrsquos fiscal philosophy. Stories of extravagant pay-outs and salaries, of a costly failed IT project, of wastefulness and excess, have dented its reputation as a wise user of licence fees. Surely, instead of penalising those on whose loyalty it has been built, it should be narrowing its focus and making ends meet For far too long the corporation has had delusions of grandeur. In trying to position itself as a front-runner in global as well as regional news, in attempting to capture every market and age group, it has spread itself too thin. In the process, its online sites have imperilled the existence of commercial media companies whose survival is not protected by licence-fee payers, as have its magazines.This is not to suggest giving programme-makers even fewer resources with which to produce the same output. Rather, it is to ask for a radical streamlining, a concentration of energies and talent, on the things the BBC has always done brilliantly: drama, documentaries, music and news.

What she did say was that Brexit was a threat to Scotlandrsquos democracy and prosperity, which is where the word ldquovalues came in. ldquoThe deadlock at Westminster over Brexit, she said, ldquois going to lead to a world view even more at odds with Scotlandrsquos values and even more damaging to our future.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Nicola Sturgeon meets Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier in Brussels\",\"description\": \"Nicola Sturgeon meets Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier in Brussels\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs VilFgCKH-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests VilFgCKH.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Now, you may think big speeches like this one donrsquot matter as much as they once did and I can understand that ndash besides, tweets donrsquot take as long to write. But a speech like Ms Sturgeonrsquos is a good opportunity to hear what a leader says theyrsquore thinking, as well as a chance to work out what theyrsquore actually doing. Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech was promoted in advance as a statement of support for EU membership and shared European values. Therersquos the V word again.However, there are several problems with the concept of values in politics ndash all of which were on display in Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech. The first is the definition: what on earth does ldquoScottish values mean  But more worrying is what happens when you promote one set of values over another. By definition,ldquoour values exist then so must ldquotheir values in other words, while purporting to promote similarity, the V word actually emphasises the dference. It isnrsquot a kind of glue, itrsquos a wedge.: Nicola Sturgeon calls Jeremy Hunt childish and pathetic after Brussels snubSo, did we get an indication from Ms Sturgeon about what she thinks ldquoScottish values means  Well, there was some talk about fairness and internationalism, but the First Minister might as well have said that Scotlandrsquos values were all kinds of everything: sailboats and fishermen, wishing wells and wedding bells. That, at least, would have been closer to the truth because when many people talk about Scottish values, what they really seem to be talking about is symbols: hills and glens and flags.The idea that Scottish people have ldquovalues also fails to understand how a country ndash or humanity for that matter ndash works. I was brought up in a family of four, in the same way, in the same country, but my siblings and I have dferent views on most issues ndash in other words, we have dferent ldquovalues and the same dferences occur outside of families. I share some ideas with some Scots, but I self-evidently donrsquot with others. My Scottishness, and your Scottishness, is irrelevant.If you donrsquot believe me, I challenge you to tell me what Scotlandrsquos values are. Perhaps itrsquos a sense that we should all be equal, but,so, in what way is believing in equality uniquely Scottish  And the truth is many Scots do not believe in equality ndash those opposed to gay marriage for example. Or perhaps you think our supposed openness to immigration is a Scottish value, but why, in that case, did so many Scots vote for Brexit  In fact, Brexit is not an English value just as pro-Europeanism is not a Scottish value and to say anything  is political vulgarity.And yet Ms Sturgeon appears to believe Scottish values do exist and therersquos a good reason for that. Nationalists, of the Brexit and Scottish iety, like to talk about values because they like to promote the idea of national identity. This can then be used to justy referendums or independence on the basis that ldquoour values are incompatible with the UK Governmentor the European Union . To do anything , and acknowledge similarities rather than dferences, undermines the case for separateness.This is exactly what Ms Sturgeon was up to in her speech and it happened again on Thursday when it was announced that Boris Johnson had topped the Tory leadership vote and the SNP reacted by publishing a mock ballot paper showing a choice between Mr Johnson and independence. No doubt, the First Minister would also say Mr Johnson is contrary to ldquoScotlandrsquos values when, in fact, Brexit is merely a policy and Mr Johnson a politician, just as independence and Mrs Sturgeon are, and it can all be changed. Scotland and the UK donrsquot have values, we have governments with policies that will be superseded by governments with dferent policies.:UK Government to get first lsquoCabinet Roomrsquo in EdinburghAnd donrsquot we also have to ask where the concept of national values might take us next  A few years ago, Michael Govedecreed that ldquoBritish values should be taught in English schools, and who was to define those values do you think  Mr Gove, of course, because thatrsquos what happens with values ndash they are always defined by politicians, usually nationalistic ones, rather than parliament or the public. Values are an instrument of nationalism and of the state.Scottish nationalists would argue, of course, that they are dferent, that their values are civic rather than nationalistic, but itrsquos easy to imagine the future government of an independent Scotland insisting on Scottish values being taught in classrooms in the way Mr Gove did with British values. Indeed, I think some nationalists might insist on it to weed out unionists at an early age.Sadly, I can also imagine a Scottish government insisting on the teaching of national pride, another of the consequences of value politics. In her speech in Brussels, Ms Sturgeon spoke about pride in being a European, and perhaps some Scots would say pride in being Scottish should be one of our values too. But shouldnrsquot we be proud of the things we achieve rather than the things we are  To be proud of a fact you cannot change is fatuous. In fact, I think I can say that is one of my rules for le. It is one of my values."},{"url":null,"title":"comment-eif-and-the-capitals-council-need-to-talk","story":"He seemed confident that the looming pound, cut it is facing can somehow be weathered, at least for the time being.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

While this trend is apparent across many ­sectors, one industry that we’ve had first-hand experience of is music. In , the music event sector was worth a whopping £. billion to the UK economy and with the new wave of experience-led events, that figure is set to increase. Music psychology researchers have found that the desire to escape reality in a setting that offers novelty is a key driver for attending a music event. The rising popularity of immersive one-day festivals and the ‘day gig’ is testament to this demand, providing people with the ultimate escape and the chance to party all day long, ­usually from noon to pm. Unlike the daylight raves that took place in fields and warehouses in the s and s, today’s official events benefit from safe spaces, first-rate sound systems and excellent amenities such as those offered by the Royal Highland Centre .The growth of day gigs can be ­evidenced by some of the events held at the RHC such as Terminal V and elrow whichyear after year and attract more than , attendees each. Freddie Norris, UK bookings and karketing manager at club party organisers elrow said: “Promoters like Terminal V and Fly are really pushing the boundaries bringing world class talent to the city. “We made our Edinburgh debut with elrow in  at Hallowe’en, bringing a massive Haunted House at the RHC. The audience response was really positive, and we made a connection both with the crowd and the city which is really important because Edinburgh’s RHC is an ideal location for music events.”Events such as these are bolstering the reputation of Edinburgh as a city that welcomes the day gig. The quality of the event organiser and the suitability of host space is ­crucial to getting the backing from City of Edinburgh Council, that ­ultimately determines whether an event can go ahead.Clearly what’s important is that events of this scale can demonstrate robust health and safety processes and an infrastructure that can cope with such numbers.It’s never been more prevalent to have high security standards for large scale events. The future of events in the city relies on event organisers and venues putting in these procedures to minimise risk to event-goers. At the RHC we work closely with health, safety and ­security ­agencies, including Police Scotland, to plan, manage and reduce incidents. The continuing investment in the RHC as Scotland’s leading events ­venue is ushering in a new age of music events with a capacity of more than , in the main hall, ­combined with  acres of outdoor space and parking space for , vehicles. Freddie added: “We are very excited to be ing to the RHC with our debut festival elrowTown in Scotland. There is so much space for activities at the RHC, and this is a key part of the elrow festival experience, plus it gives us scope to grow the event in the future.”According to EventBrite,  per cent of music festival-goers tweet or post to social media during a live concert. This trend for real-time updates and sharing of experiences has resulted in consumer demand for high-speed WiFi access to be bigger than before. That’s why at RHC we have invested in our infrastructure over the last few years to ensure we can meet this demand at the events we host. Showcasing the need for strong transport links, a survey conducted by EventBrite found that  per cent of millennialswould travel for a concert or festival, and  per cent would stay an extra night after that music event in the area. Boasting direct links to the city centre by tram and a prime location next to the airport and motorway, the RHC is also located nearby to overnight accommodation. Venues like the RHC are leading the charge and helping to put Edinburgh on the map when it comes to music events of all shapes and sizes, thus bringing an influx of vital economic benefits to the city.Lorne Scott, commercial director RHASS.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Some people dont get it could argue till the cows come home some people are very self opinionated cant tell them whats right or wrong Fully agree with haydnJohan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedster.."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":null,"title":"civil service rapped as digital project cost doubles to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Departmental officials expect that by October , total expenditure incurred will amount to £m - over twice the original contract value. Todays report also identied other weaknesses in DoFs management of the contract. It notes that, until September , the department was unable to provide details of total costs against inidual projects delivered through the contract, six years after it was established. Only four of the projects delivered through the contract reported that savings have been made, and these have yet to be veried.The report acknowledges that progress has been made in the digital transformation of public services, with  million digital transactions being completed across ious new services by March this year. However, the report criticised the way in which inidual projects delivered through the Strategic Partner Project were prioritised, with projects focused primarily on central government services rather than those most valued by the public, such as health.Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said: \"It is unacceptable that the Department of Finance did not have strong controls to monitor and manage spend through the NI Direct Strategic Partner Project. \"Lessons must be learnt and departments must put strong financial management controls in place and retain sufficient expert resources throughout the duration of major contracts.\"Digital transformation has the potential to signicantly reduce costs and improve experiences for citizens, and this report notes that some progress has been made.\"However, there is a long way to go before public services are fully citizen-focused and transformed. Achieving the full benefits of digital transformation must involve better collaboration and the development of truly transformational services that work across public sector organisations.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann, a former chair of Stormonts Public Accounts Committee, said major change is urgently needed on how public money is managed in the Civil Service.\"There is a depressing familiarity about this in terms of yet another government project running wildly over budget and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab,\" he said.\"This comes at a time when the public is still awaiting the report of the RHI Inquiry which was a spectacular failure to manage public money, and this latest overspend will do nothing to restore public confidence in how public money is being managed and looked after.\"DoF said lessons are being learned from the Audit Office report.It insisted: \"The department is working closely with NIAO in response to the report and has taken action to improve delivery and enhance future digital transformation programmes. \"The departments audit and risk assurance committee conducted an in-depth review in October  to explore the financial and contractual position with the Strategic Partner Project. \"This review resulted in new arrangements being put in place to move existing services to new arrangements before the end of the current contract. This approach has been welcomed by the Audit Office.\""},{"url":null,"title":"crossborder park project given 7 9m","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She was also the founder of the human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights-a group that supported disadvantaged groups which she continued to advise until her death.Inez Murphy was born into the Protestant tradition in Cultra, County Down in September,  and after her initial studies won a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at -years-old whilst working towards her A levels at night.At this tender age the budding champion of trade unionism didn’t fully appreciate what was actually happening in Northern Ireland and later recalled: “I was a puzzled young Prod. Until I was , I hadn’t knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn’t understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and ision in our society.”Inez McCormack’s first contact with Derry came in the years - when she attended Magee College. It was the era when the decision to locate Northern Ireland’s second university at Coleraine. The experience provided her with her first taste of ‘street politics’ and an initial glimpse at how power was abused. Between - she attended Trinity College in Dublin and it was there that she met Vincent McCormack.The pair married within three months of meeting and as her husband was a founding member of the Derry Labour Party, when they ed to Derry Inez had a first-hand insight of the growing Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. She was on the People’s Democracy march that was attacked at Burntollet by loyalists as it approached Derry in January,  and later described the era as “living through a historical defining moment.”Later in , having begun to study for a Diploma in Social Studies Inez McCormack began a career as a social worker in Ballymurphy, in . The West Belfast housing estate, ravaged by the Troubles also suffered great levels of social deprivation and in the midst of that an attempt was made to shut the Social Services office down and the workers were to be moved to a dferent area.Realising the need for them to stay the workers refused to leave Ballymurphy and they were advised to join a trade union to help them resist the pressure to go. Inez McCormack contacted the National Union of Public Employeesand all the workers were accepted as member with Inez acting as shop steward. By , she was working part-time for the union.NUPE would eventually become UNISON and in , Inez McCormack became the first female full-time official with the daunting task of achieving , members in the first five months of her employment.Realising that part-time women workers in the public sector were normally dismissed as ‘too dficult to organise’ and so weren’t part of a union, Inez McCormack began the process of signing them up.She said: “My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody.\"By the time UNISON was formed in  Inez had increased the union’s membership from  to ,. She went in to become the union’s first woman regional secretary and continued to represent low-paid women cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. Between - she was the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU and became its first woman president in .Inez McCormack’s achievements were all the more remarkable coming as they did in a very male dominated world.

The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in , and brought the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in the North.In the build-up to the  Belfast Agreement saw the adopted Derry woman running a brilliant campaign to have equality and human rights provisions included. Inez McCormack viewed this as being key to conflict resolution founded on the practice of justice.She saw that those most affected by violence in the North came from the most socially deprived communities. So, Inez McCormack’s campaign asserted the rights of the most socially excluded and she said: “Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions. I argue that a lot of the social problems come because the economy is built in a way that excludes people rather than includes.”The next landmark in Inez McCormack’s long list of achievements came in  when she set up participation and Practice of Rights . This is a Belfast group which supports marginalised groups in using a practical and unique human rights-based approach to tackle the social and economic challenges they experience. Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as \"ground breaking,\" saying, \"They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive sense of rights and dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application where.”McCormack was a founding member of the Vital Voices Global Advisory Council, and honoured in  at Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in recognition of her contributions as a human rights advocate.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

At the end of lap one you could see cracks starting to appear in all the groups.Eddie Doyle could be seen grimacing and cracking the whip in his group with the smell of money on lap five just too tempting.A large scratch group, who would normally race through like a well-oiled machine, seemed to be under a bit of pressure as Watson, Montgomery and McKee started to hit the front. It wasnrsquot long before scratch group had split completely and the three men were on their own.By lap four they were a mere  seconds from catching the last group ahead of them and it was then that McKee would lose contact and fall back to what was left of a scratch group.Behind, racers would try to put groups together as pretty much everybody looked like they were trying far too hard. No one had an easy ride in the bunch with no rest on this course. Laura Wylie would show her form holding on to her fast group until the final laps to take the first female prize. Martina Hawkins was pushing for performance of the night as, having made a slow start, would pick up positions as the lapped ticked by and would take second female.At the head of the race Monty and Watson would push each other to the limit with neither giving an inch.

outline business case designed to pave the way for a poundm tourism bonanza in Newcastle.It has been confirmed this week that local council officials are progressing the business case for a series of

included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the

unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9967347.jpg?htype=7\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Anytime Fitness Penarth gym will sit on the ground floor.Savills Cardf will start selling the homes at a price of pound, for a one-bedroom apartment.Built in the s by Stanley Sadler, the building was originally the premises of Sadler Bros Ltd, the successful car garage he ran with his brother, Aubrey Sadler. During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG. Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
