With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/16/4CA5493E00000578-5774789-image-m-31_1527348431493.jpg","title":"Back reality Meghan Markles mother Doria takes dog walk L A","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured on Friday in Los Angeles as she took her dog for a walk       EXCLUSIVE: Coldstream Guard \u0027raped young mother\u0027 in a park...Prince Charles steps out in a trendy pair of shades as he...Share this articleMs Ragland was also the only one of the actress\u0027s relatives who was seen at the wedding last week. She accompanied her in a car to the chapel at Windsor Castle then watched on, blinking away tears, as Meghan and Harry said their vows.    Ms Ragland returned to California this week after accompanying her daughter throughout the weekend in Windsor           Ms Ragland is one of the few members of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family who has not embarrassed her since she became engaged to Prince Harry  Afterwards, in a touching gesture of hospitality after their children tied the knot, Prince Charles accompanied her out of the church and then took her arm on the steps of the chapel to pose for photographs with his own wife, The Duchess of Cornwall. Ms Ragland\u0027s dignified silence about the royal romance is in stark contrast to the headline-grabbing insults thrown around by Meghan\u0027s half-siblings. It also coincides with her father\u0027s staging of paparazzi photographs in Mexico. After the wedding last Saturday, Ms Ragland joined her daughter and hundreds of other guests at a lunch in Windsor Castle.

It\u0027s moving along very nicely. So we\u0027re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn\u0027t changed. So, we\u0027ll see what happens.A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump\u0027s firm resolve to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.Trump said in a letter to Kim on Thursday he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea\u0027s open hostility.The Trump administration has demanded that North Korea completely and irreversibly shut its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump\u0027s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, and Moon said North Korea is not yet convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Doina Chiacu in Washington Additional reporting by Josh Smith, Soyoung Kim, Choonsik Yoo and Jeongmin Kim in SEOUL, and Ben Blanchard and Elias Glenn in BEIJING Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Paul Tait and Frances Kerry)"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/27/17/4CAC0A1E00000578-5777067-image-a-4_1527439171758.jpg","title":"Gordon Ramsays five bed mansion boathouse taking shape","story":"    Gordon Ramsay\u0027s holiday home is starting to take shape on a plot of land in Cornwall he bought for £4.4million          Walls of the house on the Cornwall seafront are starting to take shape months after the 1920s property was demolished  Ramsay angered some locals when he won planning permission to demolish the 1920s building on the Cornwall coastDespite local objections Ramsay won planning permission in 2016 to demolish the property and build two new houses.Ramsay is also having another smaller property built on the water\u0027s edge, a grass-covered boathouse which will contain a further three bedrooms.The 51-year-old also spent £4million on a \u0027stopgap\u0027 six-bedroom home in the village of Trebetherick, while his nearby holiday retreat is being rebuilt.That property has six bedrooms, four bathrooms, three receptions rooms, a swimming pool, tennis court and almost 2.5 acres of land.  The \u0027supercave\u0027 that can fit four Great Pyramids inside:...Shocking before and after aerial images show how Kilauea...Feet from incineration!

It is not clear whether Abedi bought his materials directly from Amazon or through one of many third-party sellers on the site.But Government sources last night said they want the web giant to alert the security agencies when customers are ‘filling up their baskets’ with bomb-making materials.Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting months.Female ex-police chief at heart of £870k sexist payout for...How thieves are stealing valuables as you go through airport...Share this articleOne line of inquiry is that he bought one item on the website as far back as January last year – five months before the attack – using the name of a family member.The explosive device has been described as being a relatively sophisticated construct made with nails, nuts and bolts. It was revealed last year that he used hydrogen peroxide to make the explosive TATP – dubbed the Mother of Satan for its instability – and the same as that used in the 77 attacks on London. The Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, 18, also used Amazon to make the bomb he left on a crowded London Tube train in September.His trial earlier this year heard how he detonated a device made from TATP, after packing it with metal items bought from Aldi and Asda and had hydrogen peroxide delivered to a friend’s address to avoid suspicion.          Emergency services respond to the attack at the Manchester Arena last year after Abedi had bought chemicals online and detonated the device at an Ariana Grande concertAnother ingredient was bought from Amazon. TATP is typically used by terror groups because it can be made using commonly available chemicals. Along with hydrogen peroxide, which is used in hair dyes, it includes other chemicals which the Mail will not name.Three of the ingredients used to make up TATP were purchased by the Mail on Thursday within minutes without warnings or security checks that may have halted the transaction. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of Nato’s Rapid Reaction Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Battalion, said Amazon needed to step up security checks. He said: ‘For Abedi to be able to buy this stuff on Amazon seems crazy to me. There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.‘Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.’Admiral Lord West, a former security minister, said: ‘Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning. Amazon needs to look at this and monitor what is being bought on its site.’ Former security minister John Hayes said: ‘It is time these companies such as Amazon step up to the mark and put the national interest ahead of any commercial interest.‘They should be encouraged to do and if this doesn’t work they should be made to do so.’Last December David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, published a report on the four terrorist attacks in Britain between March to June 2017. He said there needed to be increased cooperation between MI5 and the police and the private sector ‘to improve the detectability and even the preventability of purchases of potential explosives precursors by would-be terrorists, as undertaken before the Manchester and Parson’s Green attacks’.          Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting monthsAlthough he did not specifically mention Amazon, it is understood the Government is now working with the web giant to help stop attacks using items bought online. As well as using Amazon, Abedi downloaded material from other websites about the chemical compound used in the bomb.And he also watched a bomb-making tutorial on YouTube before the attack. The bomb-making video ‘cookbook’ showed a masked extremist in a kitchen explaining how to build explosives with easy to obtain ingredients.The products Abedi purchased were both legal and widely available. An Amazon spokesman: ‘We share suspicious transaction reports with the Home Office counter terrorism team, but we cannot comment on the specific security measures that we have in place.’Earlier this month it emerged Amazon was selling terrorist recruitment material and bomb-making manuals on its site, including books by Osama Bin Laden. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/04/4CB0B5F000000578-5777543-image-a-6_1527476557540.jpg","title":"Hippy squatters Boris Beckers abandoned Majorcan mansion","story":"    Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker\u0027s Majorcan mansion has been taken oven by a naked hippie squatter after the tennis star abandoned it following his bankruptcy last year           Georg Berres is pictured making himself at home at the villa above. Fifty-year-old former Wimbledon champion Becker is said to have earned in the region of £100million throughout his career          Becker was declared bankrupt in June last year over a £3.3million debt - forcing him to abandon the plush Spanish propertyHippie Berres, thought to be a 44-year-old former carpenter, has moved into the plush home along with a with a number of helper friends and has wasted no time sharing videos of himself wandering through the palatial grounds and sunbathing.Filming himself walking through the now unkempt grounds, Berres says: \u0027It\u0027s like nobody loved this place.Fresh turf marks spot where poisoned Russian spy and his...My evil ex tortured and killed her au pair because of me:...Share this article\u0027How can it come to this, I ask, that something like this is a habitat for wasps, geckos and spiders.

He provided the assurance to his South Korean counterpart after a spontaneous meeting in the DMZ following Trump\u0027s announcement he would pull out of the summit.    President Donald Trump has announced the summit with North Korea will take place as planned on June 12 in Singapore Sung Kim crossed into North Korean territory with Allison Hooker, the Korea expert on the White House National Security Council. They met with Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice foreign minister, the Post reported.It is she who issued a statement blasting Vice President Mike Pence for \u0027ignorant and stupid\u0027 remarks – an event that triggered Trump\u0027s letter announcing his decision to withdraw from talks.Pentagon official Randall Schriver is also in Seoul currently, the Post said.The meetings are expected to continue on Monday and Tuesday and are focused on the issue of North Korea´s nuclear weapons program, it said.The latest action in the improvisational move toward a possible summit comes as the former head of the National Security Agency, Michael Hayden, said Trump hadn\u0027t \u0027done his homework\u0027 on North Korea\u0027s nukes.  \u0027Kim Jong-un knows his program inside and out,” Hayden told ABC News \u0027This Week\u0027 on Sunday.“I think he knows what he can concede and what it means and what he cannot concede,\u0027 Hayden said.“I don\u0027t know that the president has done the kind of homework said Hayden, who also served as CIA director. Trump said Saturday after an event with reporters that things were going \u0027very well\u0027 in terms of the summit with North Korea. \u0027I think there\u0027s a lot of good will,\u0027 the president said.

It\u0027s moving along very nicely. So we\u0027re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn\u0027t changed. So, we\u0027ll see what happens.A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump\u0027s firm resolve to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.Trump said in a letter to Kim on Thursday he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea\u0027s open hostility.The Trump administration has demanded that North Korea completely and irreversibly shut its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump\u0027s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, and Moon said North Korea is not yet convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Doina Chiacu in Washington Additional reporting by Josh Smith, Soyoung Kim, Choonsik Yoo and Jeongmin Kim in SEOUL, and Ben Blanchard and Elias Glenn in BEIJING Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Paul Tait and Frances Kerry)"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/27/17/4CAD681100000578-0-image-m-73_1527437619374.jpg","title":"Jaguar driver mowed pedestrian sacked driving using mobile","story":"    Steven Russel (pictured)l, 42, was distracted by his mobile phone when he ploughed into Robert Morris, 57, who was crossing a road in Coventry at 11.20pm on December 17, 2016A Jaguar driver who had previously been sacked from his job for using a mobile phone at the wheel has been jailed for killing a man - moments after sending a text.Steven Russell, 42, was distracted by his mobile phone when he ploughed into Robert Morris, 57, who was crossing Antsy road, Coventry at around 11.20pm on December 17, 2016.The Jaguar hit Mr Morris in the nearside lane, throwing him into the air, and he landed in the road behind the car, after which Russell stopped and called 999.Mr Morris was rushed by ambulance to University Hospital, suffering from \u0027multiple and severe injuries\u0027 from which he died three days later on December 20.Morris had been on a night out with his three brothers celebrating the holidays.At an earlier hearing, a jury took seven hours to find the former HGV driver guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.He also pleaded guilty to harassing his daughter\u0027s partner by threatening him with phone calls, texts and turning up at his home.House burns down during \u0027Mother of all thunderstorms\u0027 as...Share this articleRussell, of Adelaide Street, Coventry, appeared at Warwick Crown Court on May 25 where he was jailed for seven years.The 42-year-old was also was banned from driving for eight years.Sentencing Judge Andrew Lockhart QC called the collision \u0027utterly avoidable\u0027.

It is not clear whether Abedi bought his materials directly from Amazon or through one of many third-party sellers on the site.But Government sources last night said they want the web giant to alert the security agencies when customers are ‘filling up their baskets’ with bomb-making materials.Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting months.Female ex-police chief at heart of £870k sexist payout for...How thieves are stealing valuables as you go through airport...Share this articleOne line of inquiry is that he bought one item on the website as far back as January last year – five months before the attack – using the name of a family member.The explosive device has been described as being a relatively sophisticated construct made with nails, nuts and bolts. It was revealed last year that he used hydrogen peroxide to make the explosive TATP – dubbed the Mother of Satan for its instability – and the same as that used in the 77 attacks on London. The Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, 18, also used Amazon to make the bomb he left on a crowded London Tube train in September.His trial earlier this year heard how he detonated a device made from TATP, after packing it with metal items bought from Aldi and Asda and had hydrogen peroxide delivered to a friend’s address to avoid suspicion.          Emergency services respond to the attack at the Manchester Arena last year after Abedi had bought chemicals online and detonated the device at an Ariana Grande concertAnother ingredient was bought from Amazon. TATP is typically used by terror groups because it can be made using commonly available chemicals. Along with hydrogen peroxide, which is used in hair dyes, it includes other chemicals which the Mail will not name.Three of the ingredients used to make up TATP were purchased by the Mail on Thursday within minutes without warnings or security checks that may have halted the transaction. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of Nato’s Rapid Reaction Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Battalion, said Amazon needed to step up security checks. He said: ‘For Abedi to be able to buy this stuff on Amazon seems crazy to me. There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.‘Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.’Admiral Lord West, a former security minister, said: ‘Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning. Amazon needs to look at this and monitor what is being bought on its site.’ Former security minister John Hayes said: ‘It is time these companies such as Amazon step up to the mark and put the national interest ahead of any commercial interest.‘They should be encouraged to do and if this doesn’t work they should be made to do so.’Last December David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, published a report on the four terrorist attacks in Britain between March to June 2017. He said there needed to be increased cooperation between MI5 and the police and the private sector ‘to improve the detectability and even the preventability of purchases of potential explosives precursors by would-be terrorists, as undertaken before the Manchester and Parson’s Green attacks’.          Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting monthsAlthough he did not specifically mention Amazon, it is understood the Government is now working with the web giant to help stop attacks using items bought online.

It will be auctioned on 4 July. In 1814 the theme of peace seemed appropriate as a gift to Canova’s friend John Campbell, aka Lord Cawdor, with Napoleon safely in exile and Europe hoping for tranquility after years of war. The dream was short-lived: in 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba and launched an attempt to restore his empire.The white marble representation of peace as a beautiful young woman was one of Canova’s Ideal Heads, which were often made as gifts to his friends and patrons. Campbell was both – he introduced Canova to one of his most valuable customers, the sixth duke of Bedford, who commissioned the monumental Three Graces for his mansion at Woburn. In 1994 the Three Graces was acquired jointly by the V\u0026ampA in London and the National Galleries of Scotland after an epic fundraising campaign, aided by a £1m donation from John Paul Getty Jr to keep the sculpture from going to the museum in California founded with his father’s money.Peace had a tranquil life at the Cawdor family mansion, Stackpole Court in Pembrokeshire. Campbell died in 1821, and over the next century, as the house expanded to 150 rooms holding a vast collection, the Canova was forgotten. In a sale in 1962 before the decaying house was demolished after failed attempts to persuade the local authority or the National Trust to take it on, the head was just described as “a white marble bust of a lady wearing a diadem”.The present private owner has spent years researching it, including tracing original surviving correspondence between Canova and Campbell. “It is a very personal piece,” said Christopher Mason, an expert on the period at Sotheby’s. “This is Canova working for himself, without the constraints of having to satisfy the taste of a patron. This is his own vision of the essence of human beauty.”Mason said the sale was exceptionally rare – the last Canova on the market, a rediscovered bust of Joachim Murat, king of Naples from 1807 to 1815, sold last November for €4.3m (£3.8m). “The Bust of Peace has matchless provenance dating back all the way to its conception in 1814, and so we expect a great deal of excitement,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9cd689dc797d42f2f6af05a386896b24e691436/89_995_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61714b1775cfe2111459f9598aae61ee","title":"my best summer photograph","story":"The inflatable turtle of Guantánamo, the bed-infested fields of China, the strung-out octopus of the Med … Martin Parr, Joni Sternbach and other top photographers pick their hottest shotby  Dale Berning Sawa,  Imogen Tilden,  Edward Siddons,  Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Tom GrahamKiddie Pool (Gitmo at home, Gitmo at play), 2015, by Debi Cornwall For my first project following a career as a civil rights lawyer, I decided to look at Guantánamo Bay. There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

It’s a message that can feel like a curse or a consolation: if things are going well, they won’t stay that way for long if things are going badly hold tight – change is just around the corner. In my work as a doctor it’s the consolations I emphasise – people come to my clinic in the hope of influencing a change in their lives. That change may be modest and routine, or urgent and dramatic, but inevitably it is a perennial source of hope.Many books have helped me navigate transformation’s personal, social and cultural territory. Some nudged me towards a more intimate understanding of those way stations of life I’ll never undergo, such as pregnancy or the menopause. For the former, I reached for Chitra Ramaswamy’s Expecting: across nine chapters she charts her burgeoning pregnancy. Of the linea nigra, the black line that develops down the front of the belly during pregnancy, she writes: “It bisected my stomach like a ring around a planet or a veined streak of quartz encircling a pebble, evidence of a disturbance within. Some mysterious ancient change.”To understand more about the menopause I was recommended Ursula K Le Guin’s The Space Crone – the first essay in her collection Dancing at the Edge of the World: Thoughts on Words, Women, Places. It is panoramic in scope but beautifully concise. Le Guin proposed that women become more comfortable with accepting the third stage in their lives: “The woman who is willing to make that change must become pregnant with herself, at last.” Women in the third stage of life, she said, have experienced more fully what it is to be human than any other group, having “acted the entire human condition – the essential quality of which is Change”.Changes in mental experience are another kind of transformation, from dreaming and memory to hallucination and psychosis, and mental illness may effect dramatic bodily change. Anorexia may be as baffling and frustrating for those who suffer it as it is for therapists trying to help – it has the highest death rate of any mental illness. To better comprehend its complexity I recommend Katy Waldman’s extraordinary Slate essay There Once Was a Girl. “I starved,” wrote Waldman, “to acquire that old classical capability: metamorphosis.”Feeling uncomfortable in your birth gender is another issue that brings some to the clinic, seeking prescriptions for oestrogen or testosterone. Maggie Nelson’s poetic memoir The Argonauts points out that we are all in continuous transition, irrespective of gender: “On the inside, we were two human animals undergoing transformation beside each other, bearing each other loose witness.” She quotes her transitioning partner’s impatience with the idea that anyone taking hormones must be on a journey to one binary extreme or the other: “I’m not on my way anywhere.”Some of the transformations I’ve been examining have been crises: cancer, hormonal imbalance, fracture, amputation. I met with Olivia Giles, who lost both hands and both feet to septicaemia, and whose charity 500 miles provides low-cost prosthetic limbs to amputees in Malawi and Zambia. Giles told me “the most transformative thing about prosthetic limbs is the potential they offer for children. You can see it in the mothers’ faces when the new limbs are fitted they know their child has a future.” And transformation is one of the most ancient and resonant themes in literature and art: two thousand years ago in Metamorphoses, the Latin poet Ovid painted nature and mankind as a seething maelstrom of flux. Marina Warner’s Fantastic Metamorphoses, Other Worlds maps this cultural topography since Ovid, showing how stories of change can guide us through the perils of life. “It would be stupid to suggest stories invariably enlighten,” Warner says, “but stories do offer a way of imagining alternatives, mapping possibilities, exciting hope, warding off danger by forestalling it, casting spells of order on the unknown ahead.” At its best, the same could be said of medicine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533b1b6f4c7e96a713c6761abfdb8706a6692787/0_400_7165_4301/master/7165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd79eab3be623b6fc77005583299d46e","title":"kayo chingonyi poet dylan thomas prize","story":"The winner of the Dylan Thomas prize explains how his poems are infused with the rhythms and rhymes of garage, grime and hip-hopWhen Kayo Chingonyi was awarded the £30,000 Dylan Thomas prize for his debut poetry collection, Kumukanda, he used his acceptance speech to thank some of his former school teachers, including one who had given him a copy of Thomas’s play for voices Under Milk Wood. “I was very grateful for that, it led me to Thomas’s poetry,” Chingonyi says he was delighted and surprised to have come out ahead of fellow shortlisted authors including Sally Rooney and Gwendoline Riley for the prize awarded to writers aged 39 or under, the age Thomas was when he died. “I was also grateful that these teachers shared their enthusiasms with me. A lot of what I write is embedded in my wanting to share enthusiasms.”The enthusiasm that most obviously animates Kumukanda is music, specifically garage, grime and hip-hop. Chingonyi thrillingly integrates their rhythms and rhymes with more conventional poetic metrics – there is even a sonnet – in a collection that tackles race, identity, masculinity, migration, bereavement and longing, not to mention literary tradition, with a rare energy, intelligence and sophistication. The influence of Eminem is probed alongside that of Pinter and Lowell, as Kumukanda cuts through sterile delineations of page or stage by simply privileging excellence in language and literature, whatever its source.“The most formalist poetry I have been exposed to is rap lyrics,” Chingonyi explains. “They are hyper-metrical, the rhyme schemes are intricate and the levels of allusion, and allusive play, in the average rap song is staggering. When you put that against the work of more canonical poets I think there is a lot of kinship between people driven by an affinity with, and flair for, language.” He is particularly moved by those forms which unite story with song. “My work is always trying to achieve a balance between the written and oral traditions of literature, and so it makes sense to bring together traditional canonical poetic forms with forms which are a part of their own canon, to create a canon of my own.”Some of the bare facts of Chingonyi’s life can be glimpsed in Kumukanda. He was born in Zambia in 1987 and moved to the UK when he was six after his father died. He lived in Newcastle, London and Essex and his mother died when he was just 13. He was an avid collector of music on cassette and fancied himself as a rapper: “K to the a to the y to the o,  lyrical G with a badboy flow” as the teenage Chingonyi announces in “Self-Portrait as a Garage Emcee”. “But I resist the idea that the poems are my story in any authoritative way,” he says. “The poems are drawn from certain influences and experiences, but the act of creativity is to ask how can I move beyond that into sharing with someone a text or a poem that encourages them to reflect on certain things in their own life. And when I enter into that kind of conversation, with a reader or someone in an audience, then the poem really lives in that it has a life outside of my life.”The primary theme of the book is presented in the title poem. Kumukanda is an initiation ritual for young men of the Luvale people in Zambia. Chingonyi says he first heard about it in conversations with an aunt which “opened up a space in my work to write about this feeling of loss which attends moving from one place to another. When I was thinking about this book and what type of poems I wanted to put out in the world, I kept coming back to this theme and found myself writing into it and out of it.”He says missing out on the ritual served as a metaphor for other things that he had missed from a culture which was part of his life, but was remote this led him to consider the events that had moved him “across that threshold into the adult world”.“The death of parents is something that makes people grow up sooner than they otherwise would expect,” he says. “But there are other ways. Black men are particularly racialised and some of the ways they are viewed prejudicially prompt moments of having to grow up quickly. As a kid I was never in trouble with the police, but certain interactions with them were fraught because of stereotypical notions held on both sides. Those were moments where I had to learn to carry myself in a certain way, which was not the way a child should be learning to carry himself. There have been many things that stood in for that singular moment of initiation.”Chingonyi is currently writing poems for a second collection but says he’s in no rush. “Kumukanda only came out a year ago and it still feels like early days. I’m also working on some essays that deal with notions of autobiography, cultural criticism, music, migration and other issues that sit in the middle of my life.” He will take up a post as an assistant professor at Durham university in the autumn, where he will teach creative writing as well as doing his own research. “I like it that I can participate in conversations within institutional and academic spaces, but also participate in events in the wider world. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to draw on that hybrid sensibility.” In his early writing he says music and poetry felt like separate enterprises, but he is now consciously working to integrate them. His route to poetry came through memorising song lyrics and he wants to continue to explore the powerful allure of rhythm and rhyme.“There is something about the compression of poems, and songs, that encourages you to memorise them and take them with you into the world. The best become wonderful travel companions for life.”Since I haven’t danced among my fellow initiates,following a looped procession from woods at the edgeof a village, Tata’s people would think me unfinished – a child who never sloughed off the childish estateto cross the river boys of our tribe must crossin order to die and come back grown.I was raised in a strange land, by small increments:when I bathed my mother the days she was too weak,when auntie broke the news and I chose a yellow suitand white shoes to dress my mother’s body,at the grave-side when the man I almost grew to calldad, though we both needed a hug, shook my hand.If my alternate self, who never left, could see mewhat would he make of these literary pretensions,this need to speak with a tongue that isn’t mine?Would he be strange to me as I to him, frowning as he greets me in the language of my father and my father’s father and my father’s father’s father?• Kumukanda is published by Chatto.

All the comics included in it have been published before the earliest date from the 1980s. But in another, more important way, it is entirely novel. Designed and edited by Seth of Palookaville fame, and luxuriously published by New York Review Books, it gathers together between hard covers a variety of work by Chris Reynolds, the cult Welsh-born artist who remains both underrated and too little known. The result is a collection that isn’t only beautiful to look at and to hold turning its pages, it strikes you that though these ineffably strange strips were written in another time, they work better in ours. Here, after all, is a world where technology must be treated with suspicion, workers perform random jobs whose nature is essentially pointless, and loneliness is the presiding spirit of the age. Could\u0026nbspthis be Reynolds’s moment? Perhaps.Most of these tales – The New World includes 17 short stories, the novella The Dial, and the full-length graphic novel Mauretania – begin straightforwardly enough: a man returns to his family home after a long period away a couple say goodbye having lost their jobs when the factory that employs them closes down. Only then the ground shifts. People begin talking in riddles bureaucracy starts to seem ever more nightmarish mysterious figures suddenly appear in old photographs.The result is unnerving for the reader, it’s like trying to walk on ice. Resistance, however, is futile. The only possible thing to do is to submit to this sense of disorientation, even of queasiness – and, perhaps, to take comfort in the artist’s marvellously inky drawings, whose thick lines bring to mind both woodcuts and the movies of Hitchcock in his 60s heyday (also, Victorian funeral cards). As the writer Ed Park suggests in his introduction, to call Reynolds’s comics black and white isn’t quite to do them justice they’re more like black and white and black – and it’s in that extra layer of darkness that his genius may be found.• The New World: Comics from Mauretania by Chris Reynolds is published by New York Review Comics (£24.99).

It has slashed staff numbers, which leads to poor standards and service”.The company has recently been criticised for accidentally pricing toothpaste at £7.99 in one of its hospital outlets and been accused of feeding Britain’s obesity problems by offering bargain chocolate at the till. It also had to change its policy to provide VAT refunds for shoppers travelling outside the EU from British airports after criticism for failing to pass on savings.Bryan Roberts, the insights director for TCC Global, said WH Smith’s tactic of incentivising staff to sell shoppers extra chocolate bars, take coupons for McDonald’s or encourage them to use automated tills is not shopper-friendly.“If you are an investor then WH Smith is one of the best retailers in the country its share price performance and profitability are a huge success,” he said. “But a lot of its practices don’t sit well with customer service.”A WH Smith spokesperson said: “Only 184 people commented on WH Smith as part of this survey. We serve 12 million customers each week and despite a challenging retail environment we continue to open new shops, and to maintain our presence on the UK high street.” In recent years the company has spent millions of pounds on refurbishing its stores, including about half the high street estate. Even WHS_Carpet has acknowledged that it is getting harder to find examples of grimy or damaged flooring, although they say more staff are needed to help care for stores and customers.“There’s still a lot of affection for the brand – it just needs to live up to it,” they added.This year, the organic beauty specialist Lush, the cut-price health and beauty chain Savers and the toy chain Smyths shared equal billing as the nation’s best retailer. They knocked last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds, down to fourth and sixth place respectively.John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place – its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010. Ben Clissitt, the Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b09d3b2708b66aed2f813ccff6df8e4af53884f/0_204_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8360d699918d8fd9c5c2108e0f0d1f","title":"the guardian view on the irish referendum now for the north","story":"The implications of the Irish referendum vote will be felt around the world. The most immediate effect must be in Northern Ireland: five Conservative women who have all been ministers for women and equality are urging Theresa May to override the DUP and significantly relax abortion laws there. They are right to do so, although she is resisting. The province’s absurdly strict law means rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not seen as valid reasons for termination. However, Ireland will now be looking to make an abortion law that reflects the 21st century – and so should the United Kingdom as a whole.Labour MP Stella Creasy has proposed amendments to a forthcoming domestic violence bill which would provide a mechanism to do so. Abortion in the UK is framed by a 1967 statute which did not decriminalise termination but introduced a narrow exemption from the criminal law. Deeper reforms are needed and these must be extended across the UK. At the very least, women in England and Wales, like those in Scotland, ought to be allowed to take the abortion pill in their own homes. It is a fraught debate but on a free vote this will surely be carried. The\u0026nbsphome secretary, Sajid Javid, must provide MPs with\u0026nbspa bill that would allow Ms Creasy’s amendments to\u0026nbsprelax abortion laws across the UK.Friday’s vote was a ringing victory for humanity, for honesty, and for women’s rights but what matters just as much is that it followed years of profound and thoughtful debate which led to voters reflecting and then\u0026nbspchanging their minds. That is the way that democracies are meant to deliberate. Politicians spoke clearly some of them were brave enough to change their minds in public, but polling suggests that when it comes to questions of personal morality, people in both the UK and Ireland may pay less attention to politicians than to their own judgment and conscience. What changed minds, it seems, was often the long years of experience of what the absolute ban on abortion had meant in women’s lives. The personal\u0026nbspreally did become political reality.A woman’s right to choose is not just a right over her own body. It is also, and at least as important, a woman’s right to choose what to believe and what to put her faith in. The right to choose what you believe is of course fundamental in any democracy. It is also what lies behind the collapse in the authority of the Catholic church in Ireland, which had dictated or attempted to dictate the relations between the sexes ever since the foundations of the state. Successive referendums on orce, on equal marriage, and now on abortion, have shown how public opinion, and indeed the public sense of what is just and right, have shifted away from Catholic teaching. The power that the church had once exerted through its links with the state came to corrupt and then to destroy its moral authority when the abuses of that power came to light in the treatment of abused children and\u0026nbspunmarried mothers.The result should give heart to all those women (and men) in the US who resist the sometimes murderous campaign of the religious right against safe and legal abortion. It should be a beacon of hope to the women of Poland, where an authoritarian Catholic government which draws its strength from the countryside forces tens of thousands of women to travel abroad for abortions every year. But in Ireland, there was a majority for repeal in all but one rural constituency. The ultimate, profoundly liberating lesson of this vote is that when women, and men, have the right to choose, they will vote as their conscience tells them, not as authority directs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d85c9dd1efd98d63e39ac1131df624a69565db3d/0_243_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6915ec2cb5a1d9a0f7917c4bbf170c90","title":"galileo space eu satellite brexit microcosm","story":"A row over the UK’s access to the Galileo project, the European satellite global-positioning system used both for civil and military purposes, is the latest tussle about what Brexit would mean for British science and technology. For all the familiar, rhetorical huffing and puffing, the dispute is another illustration of the myriad small-print complexities that need to be resolved if the UK departs from the EU.For the EU the position seems quite clear. The UK agreed previously to restrictions on access to sensitive, secure data from Galileo for countries outside the EU, so why should it expect to become an exception? This is just another example of the “let’s just keep everything we have now” fantasy that one senior EU official recently lamented.Needless to say, your response to this tiff will depend on your sympathies to Brexit generally: either “what on earth – or in space – did we expect?”, or “why is Brussels being so bloody-minded?” Either way, it is rather late in the day to be discovering yet another stumbling block. In a paper published in March, the House of Commons committee on science and technology expressed exasperation at the government’s dilatory attitude towards the complications of the many science-related EU programmes and agreements in which the UK has been embedded. In its Panglossian document Collaboration on science and innovation last September, the government expressed eternal optimism that all could be resolved while offering very little indication of how that might happen.On Galileo that document said little more than, in effect: “Our people have helped develop it and we’re really good at space, so we hope you’ll let us carry on as before.” It pointed out that there are currently negotiations with Norway and the US for access to the crucial public regulated service (PRS) from Galileo, the encrypted signal designed for security activities. Indeed there are, but nothing is yet agreed.Another point of contention is the EU’s Copernicus satellite network for monitoring of the natural environment, which will collect important data on climate change, natural disasters and ecosystems such as fish stocks. Here too the future of UK involvement is unclear – and is complicated by the fact that Copernicus is partly funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). Because ESA operates independently of the EU, the UK would remain a member after Brexit.In short, it’s getting very messy, and the clock keeps ticking. The UK space agency, though, is in a rather bullish mood in the wake of the recent Space Industries Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for all kinds of new space initiatives including the building of launch sites on UK soil. Two sites are already planned, in Cornwall and Scotland. Private space-industry companies are springing up everywhere, and while it’s doubtful that the UK could achieve very much in space by itself, its continuing role in ESA, along with hoped-for collaborations with the US and Australia (which announced a new $26m space agency earlier this month), are helping to create the impression of a boom time for British astronautics. No wonder Tim Peake’s six-month stint on the International Space Station is being milked for all the publicity value it’s worth.In one view, Brexit creates an opportunity to unfurl the UK’s space ambitions on a wider platform. In another, jeopardising the potential markets in Europe, at such a crucial moment, while hyping vague plans to do space deals with nations on the other side of the planet, looks insane.And this, of course, is Brexit in microcosm, as doubtless played out also on countless other commercial and industrial stages across the sectors. Once again it seems that the only way we’ll have our cake and eat it is by baking our own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd71f07b5b6a41ff51881e732e20752fc91c1840/0_44_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5963d6e40c6f7a1d8775ded5a5960b","title":"return colonial artefacts to build bridges post brexit olusoga says","story":"Speaking at Hay festival, BBC historian says museums are full of objects from countries that are now trading partnersBritish museums should send back thousands of objects taken from former colonies to help build bridges in the post-Brexit world, according to the historian David Olusoga.Olusoga, who was one of the three presenters of the recent BBC series Civilisations, told the Hay literary festival that European and American museums were full of objects taken in violent raids from countries that are now the UK’s trading partners.He told the audience a friend of his had come up with a solution: “He said we should have a special version of Supermarket Sweep where every country is given a huge shopping trolley and two minutes in the British Museum. Maybe he’s right, maybe that’s the way forward.”Olusoga, who arrived in the UK from Nigeria as a child, has a particular interest in the Benin bronzes that are housed in the British Museum and other museums across Europe. He said the case to return them was particularly compelling.“I think it’s a very, very clear case of appropriation and theft,” he said. “They were taken in 1897 during the raid on the Palace of Benin. The palace was destroyed they were taken and then sold to pay for the cost of the military adventure. Everyone was open about this – steal this stuff, send it to pay for the cost of the bullets. It’s just such a stark case of theft.”He said there were around 4,000 objects taken from the Nigerian palace that were national treasures. “The idea that your national treasure would be in the museum of another country is something that as British people we would find absolutely impossible to get our heads around,” he said, “but that’s what Nigerians have to think about.“The things that we regard as the greatest cultural artefacts, the greatest things we ever produced, our greatest works of art are in the museums of other countries, and we know the date they were taken and the circumstances they were taken.”If museums only sent what was back in storage, “you would have the biggest collection in Nigeria”.One of the most high-profile and perennially contentious cases involves the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, taken from Greece by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century.Olusoga believes they should go back, as should objects taken from the summer palace in Beijing in 1860 by Elgin’s son. Olusoga said he was brought up in Britain by his mother who was determined that her mixed race children would remain connected to their father’s culture. He was taken to the British Museum and made, “I should stress the word ‘made’”, to read books about African history and Benin. The Benin bronzes are particularly powerful. “You can’t look at them and not remember where you are when you’re looking at them. Their situation, their geography is part of the story. They are wonderful works of art but they are mainly spread across Europe and America, and therein lies the story.” There is a moral case for repatriating objects but also a self-interest one in terms of making friends, Olusoga said. Museums argue that, by law, they are not currently permitted to deaccession the objects.Many have agreed to repatriate human remains, however, and the V\u0026ampA recently raised the prospect of sending back treasures taken from Ethiopia – after the capture of the mountain city of Maqdala – on long-term loan.Many museums have such loans in place but some believe they should go much further. The debate was given impetus in November when Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said in a speech: “African heritage can’t just be in European private collections and museums.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733cea149f8b9016a6615858a8757b8fa6e50838/0_0_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d545afc0c2a2cb7830de9d772321fcb","title":"revealed developers cashing in privatisation uk student housing","story":"More than 20,000 UK students are paying for rooms owned by companies based offshoreTens of thousands of undergraduates are paying for accommodation at universities where developers are cashing in on the privatisation of student housing using offshore companies, a  investigation has found.More than 20,000 students are paying for rooms owned by companies based in places such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg but that figure is likely to be an underestimate given the surge in building in university towns in recent years.The holding structure means that overseas investors are able to sell on the rooms without paying tax on their gains and it allows buildings to change hands without any stamp duty bill. Complex company arrangements also give companies the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay while charging students up to £14,000 a year in fees for high-end housing.One company collected £2.2m in rental income in 2016 but contributed just £10,000 in income tax after it paid £2.1m in charges, mostly to a Luxembourg based holding company.For residential property the only real advantage is anonymity - rules introduced in recent years mean that you will pay more tax to put a home into an offshore company, and face an annual fee to if the property is worth more than £500,000. But for commercial properties there are still benefits - overseas investors can sell properties held in offshore companies without triggering a UK capital gains tax (CGT) bill. And purpose-built student accommodation qualifies as commercial property.Buying a building directly will trigger a stamp duty land tax bill, but if you buy the shares in a company that owns a commercial property, you will escape the tax. If the company is in a country with no tax on share purchases, even better. On a building costing £25m the potential saving is £1m.They are. The 2017 budget included a consultation on bringing offshore companies into CGT, and the plan is to do that in April 2019. The consultation issued in November suggested that gains made prior to that date will not count - calculations will be based on the value of properties on 1 April 2019 and it will only be future gains that are taxed.Possibly not - the main advantages will have disappeared, and owning property via a UK company is pretty straightforward. However, if they are holding properties in a number of different countries they may still see a practical value to not using a UK company.The structures are perfectly legal, but MPs and students criticised their use.John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “Students are squeezed enough without paying high rents to offshore companies. It is a disgrace that offshore companies are maximising their gain from UK students whilst minimising their tax liability here.“That this is perfectly legal demonstrates exactly why parliament needs to thoroughly examine issues of tax avoidance, evasion and offshoring.”The student accommodation industry has been transformed in recent years as universities have turned to private developers to provide accommodation.One study estimated the market to be worth £45bn and billions of pounds worth of deals were done in 2017 alone. Investors from all over the world have snapped up student properties in England and Wales including big pension funds, foreign states and wealthy iniduals.Those that bought companies holding buildings, rather than buying properties directly, will not have had to pay any stamp duty land tax.Analysis of Land Registry data and company accounts show many developments are owned by investors through companies or funds set up abroad. found developments all over England and Wales – including London, Exeter, Newcastle, Chester and Bristol.Holding a property offshore currently allows overseas investors to sell on properties without a UK tax bill on their profits. This is due to change in April 2019, although any gains made before then are expected to be ignored and not subject to tax.Complex structures involving large loans and charges also allow investors to minimise the profits they pay tax on and make gains on sales without facing any bill from HMRC.Investors may own whole blocks or, in some cases, snap up inidual rooms with the promise of high returns. For instance, among the owners of one student block in Newcastle are companies based in jurisdictions including United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.Investors paid about £100,000 for each room, with students charged upwards of £135 a week to live there.Accounts for the UK manager of the Courtrooms, a Student Housing Company block in Bristol where students pay £161 a week for an en-suite single room, show that in 2016 it collected a rental income of £2.2m and paid £10,000 in income tax. The bill was reduced by charges of almost £2.1m, the bulk of which were payments to Unicity XV Bristol Sarl, a Luxembourg company registered as the owner of the property.A spokesperson said: “We are a responsible business whose revenue and operations are taken into account when calculating profits on which we pay tax.”Analysis by the  found more than 100 student apartment blocks around England and Wales owned by different offshore companies, with the actual number likely to be higher as there is no clear way to identify student properties in the records.Land Registry listings cover only England and Wales, and some blocks are described as “land”, or another type of building, because that is what the developer purchased before converting into student rooms.Owners are liable for UK tax on the rents they collect from students, but can receive the money before tax and reduce the amount they have to pay by offsetting expenses and debt repayments.One big investor is GSA, which in partnership with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund owns 13 buildings around the country managed by the Student Housing Company. The buildings are owned by separate Luxembourg companies.Millions of pounds in rent is collected by UK companies that then pass on payments to Luxembourg. The Luxembourg companies charge high costs for managing the buildings, allowing the firm to reduce the tax it pays.The National Union of Students vice-president for welfare, Izzy Lenga, said UK students were seen as a cash cow by overseas investors, and often had no choice but to take rooms in “overpriced glass towers”.Lenga said: “Overseas investors make billions of pounds building luxury apartments and charging sky-high rents for students. There is a cost of living crisis and finding good-quality affordable accommodation is a huge barrier for low- and middle-income students attending our world-leading institutions.”Additional reporting by Sunniva Kolostyak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c98c6d495d25c15f9369b4a68b1d21b332701a/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fa1490e72b6cdb07d11f36e047b433f","title":"huge rise in food redistribution to people in need across uk","story":"One in eight people in the UK go hungry every day – with the most needy increasingly dependent on food banks – yet perfectly good food is wasted every day through the food production supply chain.FareShare said it was now redistributing food that otherwise would have been wasted with an annual value of £28.7m, up from £22.4m last year. “Three years ago we were helping to feed 211,000 people a week – today it’s three-quarters of a million,” said FareShare’s chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. “We reported in 2015 that we provided food across 320 towns and cities – now it’s 15,000. It’s not rocket science to see there has been a massive hike in demand for food from frontline charities.”FareShare currently redistributes about 13,500 tonnes of surplus food every year donated by supermarkets, wholesalers and suppliers to 9,653 charities including hospices, homeless shelters, care homes and women’s refuges, but its annual target is 100,000 tonnes. Demand for surplus food has soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK.FareShare says it has the capacity – and a waiting list of charities wanting help – but needs access to more food. Its solution is a government fund that would cover the costs of storage and transport. Available to any charity or producer that incurs the costs of redistributing food, it would also save charities and other beneficiaries £150m by making free food available to them. A public petition supporting this move attracted more than 16,000 signatures, which guarantees a government response. “Food poverty can happen to anyone, and it can happen quickly,” said Boswell. “The 10,000 charities we support provide food to people who have lost their homes, left the armed forces and struggled to adjust, escaped violent relationships, fallen into drug or alcohol misuse or simply can no longer cook for themselves.”City Harvest, the largest of the London-based food redistribution charities delivers more than 15 tonnes of food each week. Founded in 2014, it focuses on the “last mile” between a shop or event and charity, and has so far redistributed 900 tonnes of food waste, creating 2.1m meals for vulnerable people in London. It also takes food from major wholesalers such as New Covent Garden Market and Western International.City Harvest chief executive, Laura Winningham, said: “We work in tandem with Fareshare who have been extremely supportive of our food rescue work. We are collecting this year from the Chelsea flower show. The food donated last year was fantastic. Surplus is often dictated by the weather and last year in the sunshine people browsed the garden exhibits more and ate less so vulnerable people across London ate extremely well when we redistributed the surplus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932625e90b585f3b9ab4de31dbddbdb0dab8ba26/0_0_2800_4754/master/2800.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e88c9c513a50010660695cac5f93084 700w","title":"mohamed salah confident fit world cup","story":"Jürgen Klopp will make a renewed attempt to prise the goalkeeper Alisson from Roma this summer as he looks to upgrade Liverpool’s squad following defeat in the Champions League final.While Liverpool players refused to blame the “infinitely sorry” Loris Karius for defeat against Real Madrid in Kiev, with Dejan Lovren appealing for criticism of the 24-year-old to be restrained, their manager has already made plans to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper for next season.Alisson, Liverpool’s opponent in the Champions League semi-final, remains Klopp’s favoured choice with the Brazilian scouted extensively throughout the season.Roma, however, have been resistant to dialogue with Liverpool this year and it will require a considerable offer to test the Italian club’s resolve. Alisson’s employers have also been scarred by internal criticism for selling Mohamed Salah to Liverpool last summer for £36.9m. There were fears that the Egypt international could miss the World Cup with the shoulder injury that changed the complexion of the final although he tweeted on Sunday night that he is “confident” he will be available.Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid has also been linked with Anfield but Klopp was prepared to persist with Karius after his £4.7m signing from Mainz responded well to being confirmed Liverpool’s No\u0026nbsp1 ahead of Simon Mignolet. But that was the position prior to the aberrations that contributed to the 3-1 defeat in Ukraine. The Liverpool manager insisted he and his club “will be with” Karius as he comes to terms with the errors that enabled Real Madrid to record a third consecutive Champions League triumph. He may have to broaden his search for a new first choice keeper should Roma maintain their stance on Alisson.Klopp’s plans for midfield improvement are in place with Naby Keïta secured for £52.75m from Red Bull Leipzig and Lyon captain Nabil Fekir targeted for a transfer costing a minimum of £60m. Klopp will be armed with a sizeable transfer budget having made around £70m for reaching the Champions League final and banked £142m from the January sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.Karius was inconsolable after the final on Saturday and apologised to Liverpool fans and team-mates for his two mistakes. On Sunday he extended his apology on social media. “I know I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down,” the goalkeeper wrote. “Haven’t really slept until now. The scenes are still running through my head again and again. I’m infinitely sorry to my team-mates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I’d just like to turn back the time but that’s not possible.”Liverpool players were criticised for not consoling the young German keeper immediately after the final whistle but there was only support for Karius afterwards.Lovren said: “When we win, we win together. When we lose, we lose together. Don’t blame him. It’s easy to blame someone but we are in the same ship together and everyone gave him the best words that they can. He will come back strong. You cannot find the words. He had a difficult start last season, so I believe in him. Don’t make massive stories about that. Of course it’s big because it’s a final, but everyone makes mistakes.”Andy Robertson had a similar message for the Liverpool keeper. “We win as a team, we lose as a team and we fell short,” the Scottish full-back said. “Of course he made mistakes but we are not blaming him. He has been incredible since he got the number one jersey. He is young and he will learn from it. He will be a top, top keeper. We have fallen short and there are no words that we can say to Loz that will make it better for him.”Robertson was one of many Liverpool players in Kiev who insisted that Salah’s cruel exit after 30 minutes, and not Karius’s mistakes, was the true turning point of the final. He also suggested, diplomatically as possible, that there was an element of intent behind Sergio Ramos’s prolonged hold on Liverpool’s leading goalscorer.“I think it is just how Mo has landed but Ramos is quite clever, isn’t he?” said Robertson, rhetorically. “It is just the way he has landed on it. It disrupted our rhythm a wee bit. Everyone looks because it is Mo Salah. He has done unbelievable this season and for it to end that way for him was devastating.”Lovren concurred: “We are devastated, it’s heartbreaking. Mo is one of the most important players for us and it’s not the same when you don’t have him on the pitch. The mindset is totally different when you have him on the pitch. It was difficult to accept that we, again, had such an unlucky moment with so many injuries. I cannot believe we had so many injuries this season.”The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, described his second defeat in a European final for the club as “the worst feeling I have had in football”. But he was adamant the consistent progress Liverpool have made under Klopp would not be disrupted by the latest setback and silverware under the German coach will materialise.“I believe we will be in another Champions League final,” Henderson said. “I believe we will be challenging in all competitions domestically. The Premier League is important to us and we are qualified for the Champions League next year so we need to do it sooner rather than later. I believe in this team, I believe in this manager and I believe we are going in the right direction. It is so difficult to stand here now and say that but that is the truth. It is how I feel. We have to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a71baee31be175ee108f68c0cafc836dc368604/53_141_4436_2662/master/4436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a07051c7b106b8bbf3bcf84bb50f55","title":"cristiano ronaldo future real madrid champions league final","story":"Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, said we had heard it all before but we had not, not quite like this. Sergio Ramos had not even collected the European Cup, their third in a row, when Cristiano Ronaldo referred to it in the past – to all of it. “It was nice to be at Madrid,” he said, standing pitchside at the Olympic Stadium, Kiev. Was? “In a few days I will give a response to the fans, because they have always been at my side.” And so a historic moment shifted. The night had yet another narrative.A few minutes earlier a pitch invader had stood between Ronaldo and a goal in the final, which might have helped to bring some of the sentiment to the surface but this, he later admitted, had been brewing for much longer: “When you hold on and hold on, when you have a heart and you’re honest, sometimes you lose control.” The stress on “have” as he stood by the pitch revealed that, while fans have supported him, others have not. There was a reflection of that desire for affection in the remark made by Sergio Ramos shortly after. Literally, it translates as: “Cris likes to let him himself be loved,” and it implies a want, a need, a call for attention, for appreciation.Back in Madrid, at the statue of Cibeles where they celebrate titles, he got that. There were chants of “Ronaldo, stay!” But while the fans’ relationship with him has not always been perfect, when it comes to those whose support he has missed, Ronaldo was thinking principally of Pérez, and it was Pérez who responded. “Now is not the time for inidual issues the club is more important than anyone,” he said.What came next was even more pointed. “I am glad he has five European Cups, like me.” And then he said it: “The same thing is heard every summer and then nothing happens.” They had not expected to hear it now, in the midst of celebration. They also did not expect to hear something similar from Gareth Bale, although that did feel different, Zinedine Zidane saying: “I\u0026nbspunderstand him.”Ronaldo had just won his fourth European Cup with Real Madrid, his fifth in total. This is their fourth in five years. Luka Modric likened it to the Bulls, the Lakers and the Celtics, basketball teams that established a dynasty. “Now you can call this a dynasty too.”Marcelo called it a “special night” but now he was forced to field different questions. They all were. In the post-match press conference Zidane shrugged: “What do you want me to say? I can’t change what he said. But now it’s important to enjoy the moment.”By the time Ronaldo appeared again it was past 1am and that message had clearly been conveyed to him as well. “The timing was not ideal,” he conceded. He insisted he did not want to sully the moment for\u0026nbsphis team-mates, “the real champions here”, and the contrition seemed genuine. But he was not backing down.Things a little like this have come out before, which is what Pérez was getting at. He did not sign Ronaldo but rather inherited a done deal and the relationship has not always been good. Ronaldo has publicly said he was “sad” before, he had felt alone at Fifa galas, during his legal battle with the Spanish tax authorities, and there have been difficulties over contract renewals. One theory is that the pursuit of Neymar has not helped, just as it did not help when Pérez once told Ronaldo that he could go if he brought them money to sign Messi instead.Before Ronaldo last renewed his contract, negotiations had often appeared at breaking point. A year ago A Bola, a Portuguese sports newspaper, claimed he wanted to leave. Ronaldo never denied it but almost three months later he did remind people that the words were not actually his. These words were. “I cannot guarantee I will be at Madrid next season.” He was swift to insist this was not about money – nor jealousy. “I\u0026nbsphave five Champions leagues, five Ballon d’Ors, I’ve been top scorer six years in a row. Who am I going to be jealous of?”Madrid know how important he is – or the players do, anyway, and so does Zidane – but at some point the club know they will have to confront a post-Cristiano Ronaldo era. His position has ramifications for Bale, too the departure of one may help prevent the departure of the other. The question embarking on a new era is when and how. Ronaldo is 33 and Pérez is not averse to starting now but Ronaldo has accelerated since he turned 30, becoming more effective than ever.“I know what I give the club,” Ronaldo insisted. Others, he feels, perhaps do not.This has a long way to go, even if in the next few days he does, as promised, make an announcement and even if that does reveal a determination to depart, with everything that implies. Or if he announces a change of heart, a rapprochement. It might be that nothing happens, just as Pérez claimed, but this cannot play out quite like those other times we have not heard this before.“Where would you be better off than here?” Ronaldo was asked. “Difficult,” he said. “This is the best club in the world but life is not all about glory.”No, but the moment was supposed to be. It was almost 3am when Ramos left the stadium. He dashed past journalists waiting for a word – about the final, about history, about Mohamed Salah, about Bale’s goal, now of course about Ronaldo. He hurried past, grinned, winked and nodded at the huge trophy he carried in his hands, as if to say this is all that matters. And on Saturday night in Kiev it should have been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e31b85f5e8f73e213eddc422e24a50930fb4c0/233_89_2167_1300/master/2167.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d5de20701581b0dc11e88781e2ac88","title":"quiche watercress asparagus soup salad frittata recipe rosie birkett","story":"Two sunny salads, an easy quiche and a spring-fresh soup for an easy pack-and-goHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.

He and his wife hardly slept, ate bad food and listened to strangers weeping. And they were happyWe spent high summer in a\u0026nbspwindowless room on the postnatal ward. It wasn’t even really a\u0026nbsproom\u0026nbsp– just papery blue curtains iding us from five other families. Through the thin fabric, we could hear fate dealing out the cards. On one side, a\u0026nbspmother saying she needed no pain relief and her baby was latching beautifully. On the other, a\u0026nbspmother saying she could hardly bear to look at the thing, let alone feed it. Whenever I\u0026nbspwalked down the corridors, I\u0026nbspsaw other parents sobbing. The happy sobbers were indistinguishable from the sad ones. For our part, our son had an infection from the three-day labour. We had told the doctors we didn’t want him on antibiotics and they said he could be dead within hours and then we said we wanted all the\u0026nbspantibiotics.Twice a\u0026nbspday for seven days, I\u0026nbspshuttled our tiny yellowish creature from the ward to the special care baby unit. I\u0026nbsptook him there in a\u0026nbspplastic box on wheels that looked like a\u0026nbspportable fish tank. He had a\u0026nbspbulky cannula inserted into his wrist. We had to put one of my socks over his arm to stop him tearing out the needle. It was an orange sock and every time I\u0026nbsptook him to get his antibiotics he would whack his outsize orange arm against the sides of the fish tank in protest, like a\u0026nbsplobster who knows he is destined for the pot. Then the doctors would push liquids into his blood and he would scream and then take a\u0026nbsphuge breath so that he could scream\u0026nbspagain.Walking back to the ward each day, I\u0026nbspalways glimpsed the TV in the waiting room, showing Wimbledon. There was Roger Federer, tossing a\u0026nbspball high into sunlight. There was Sue Barker silhouetted against a\u0026nbspcrisp blue sky. Henman hill writhed with all the sunburnt, child-free fans whose only worries were the poor distribution of strawberries in their Pimm’s. Meanwhile, in our lightless cave, we hardly slept, ate bad food and listened to strangers weeping. This was our life now. Summer was for other people. But the strangest thing about all this is that we were\u0026nbsphappy.I had heard stories about the powerful feelings that come with parenthood, but had always feared they would not apply to me. That I\u0026nbspwould be hollow-hearted, coldly observing my child, making notes for my novel. So it was a\u0026nbspshock and a\u0026nbsprelief to discover that I\u0026nbspwas irredeemably\u0026nbspsoppy.My wife and I\u0026nbsplook back on our incarceration as a\u0026nbspmagical time. Who needs sunlight when you can bask in the jaundiced glow of your only child? Our feelings of love for him spilled over into everything. We saw great beauty in using the disposable vomit bowls to display our bruised-fruit selection. The motor of my wife’s electric bed made a\u0026nbspsound that was exactly the same as the horn intro to Jump Around by House of Pain and this brought us way more pleasure than it should have. We were in a\u0026nbspliteral house of pain\u0026nbsp– a\u0026nbsphospital. And jumping around was something my wife would not be able to do for weeks. Ha ha ha\u0026nbsp– life was brilliant. It was a\u0026nbspkind of Stockholm syndrome, we now realise. In fact, it feels like the whole of parenthood is a\u0026nbspkind of Stockholm syndrome. You learn to love the thing that takes you\u0026nbsphostage.After two weeks, we finally emerged from the hospital, pushing a\u0026nbsppram.

Growing up in Portsmouth, I felt it was the far superior seaside town. Even though it’s just an hour away on the fast train, for me, in 2003, it felt like a different world. In Portsmouth, I felt trapped. I knew lots of people and I’m from a big family, so I always felt like I was being watched: I wasn’t. I would get on the train at Fratton, she would jump on at Chichester and 60 minutes later I would be looking out on Brighton beach.Brighton was the perfect place for a little gay to have a go at being “out” for an hour or so before going back home and pretending to have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio (when, in truth, I just wanted to kiss Kate Winslet).She was fit, cool and had a really good MP3 player. I guess it was my first flutter of feelings for someone. I don’t think we were a couple, we never had that chat, we just both knew we were a bit different from everyone else, and in Brighton that summer we felt normal. I remember seeing older girls on the seafront pretty, cool and happily queer. I would stare at them, besotted, and wonder what their lives were like, if their families knew or if they had been kicked out of home. Were they ashamed like me? They seemed happy and they were having a laugh. It gave me hope that coming out wouldn’t ruin my life. That summer, I felt alive, I felt free. We shared roll-up cigarettes and the occasional kiss under the pier, talking about who we were going to become, where we were going to live and the adventures we would share.The six-week summer break came to an end and so did our brief romance. She decided to come out when we went back to college: she was telling everyone, even her mum. I thought she had completely lost her mind (it took at least another five years to get me out of the closet). We had a huge row on Brighton pier just in front of the waltzers a few people stopped to watch, which felt both exciting and embarrassing. She called me a dyke, I called her a bitch and we barely spoke again.It wasn’t exactly the perfect ending to my summer of love. After the row, she stormed off and I jumped on my skateboard and flew down the seafront with tears in my eyes and sea salt in my hair. I felt like I was in music video, which was thrilling, until I clipped a stone, came tumbling off and ripped my favourite pair of Dickies jeans. I vowed I would never love again, in that way that only a 17-year-old can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c89769ba25da7ff5b94a0c685e31a2b63076eb/0_0_3500_2570/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fc362fb43b6aaffa331245c3c3c528f 620w","title":"kylie minogue turns 50 in pictures","story":"To most she is just ‘Kylie’, but originally she was Charlene on Neighbours before her transition to chart-topping singer.

Profile‑wise, it was great for me to get out there.”Coming off an excellent win against the world No\u0026nbsp10 John Isner in Lyon last week to reach his first ATP semi‑final he plays the experienced and improving German Peter Gojowczyk, providing company, at least, for the British No\u0026nbsp1, Kyle Edmund, who plays on Tuesday against Alex de Minaur. Alongside Johanna Konta and Heather Watson in the women’s draw, this constitutes one of the tiniest British contingents to invade France since the Scarlet Pimpernel and friends went underground to rescue aristocratic halfwits from the guillotine. If Norrie makes the cut in the first round, he will not be as surprised as some who are yet to catch up on his story he gives every indication of becoming a valuable and interesting addition to the narrative, quietly confident and scared of no\u0026nbspone.The most striking aspect of his imminent rise to 85 in the world has been his near-effortless embrace of clay: he had not played a Tour‑level match on the stuff until February, when he came from two sets down to stun the seasoned clay-courter Roberto Bautista Agut on the first day of the Davis Cup tie in Spain. The former captain John Lloyd called it “one of the most impressive debuts of all time”.Stamina more than likely is in his genes. During his second slam appearance at the US Open last year – where he beat the tough Russian Dmitry Tursunov and gave the world No\u0026nbsp19 Pablo Carreño Busta something to think about in three sets – his father, David, was cycling the route of the Tour de France. His mother, Helen, has run a 3hr 03min marathon, and her father was also a decent runner.Gojowczyk, who reached the final in Geneva on Saturday and has won more than he’s lost this year, could be in for a tough time on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45bf8e77e3b2b9e52e48ad619459e8dc4d22a569/0_205_3211_1927/master/3211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d28a2ff5fc3b5030ef7b91c683bd324","title":"chris froome giro victory questions adverse analytical finding","story":"Refreshingly, many of the new generation emerging in cycling are unencumbered by clear memories of the sport’s recent past. It is partly in that context that the reaction of the New Zealander George Bennett to Chris Froome’s Giro d’Italia winning performance on Friday en\u0026nbsproute to Bardonecchia has to be seen.Confronted with the news that Froome had held out over 80 kilometres over three mountains to take the overall lead, Bennett – captured on video by his Lotto-NL team’s social media people and by the website cyclingnews – could not hide his disbelief. “Did Froome stay away? No way. He did a Landis. Jesus!” His reference was to Floyd Landis’s astonishing comeback to win at Morzine in the 2006 Tour de France, which set up the American as, provisionally, the overall winner, until a positive test for testosterone was announced.This kind of parallel is the stuff of any spin doctor’s nightmares and Lotto-NL promptly issued a statement explaining that Bennett did not mean to cast aspersions. “This is not an insinuation but a way to express the admiration for an exceptional achievement,” the team said. Bennett, inevitably, was asked to explain himself, which – less inevitably but admirably – he was willing to do. “If we can’t compare a cyclist to another cyclist, we can’t make a comparison to any cyclist in the last 20 years,” he argued just before the stage start on Saturday.That point regarding the complexity of ranking performance in a sport that is dogged by half a century of doping is well made but cycling’s current ability to tie itself in knots is second to none. On one level Froome’s ride to Bardonecchia was the climax of a breathtaking Giro, which saw dramatic collapses – Esteban Chaves, Simon Yates and Thibaut Pinot, who abandoned on Sunday morning – and a dramatic reversal of fortune, from a position where it looked as if Froome stood no chance of his third consecutive Grand Tour victory.On another level this was pretty much what had been feared by those who felt that Froome should not ride the Giro d’Italia as he awaits the verdict on an adverse analytical finding for salbutamol, which he is contesting on the grounds that he has done nothing wrong. The issue is nothing to do with Froome personally. He showed courage, moral and physical, in making that escape on Friday, he demonstrated breathtaking descending skill and he showed admirable sangfroid in limiting his losses day by day for the first two weeks of the Giro. If ever there was a race that demonstrated the adage that you may not win a stage race on any given day but you must try not to lose it, this was the one.A Froome win leaves the race result in abeyance pending the ruling. He may keep the win or he may not.If the results were to be rejigged, however, that act alone cannot rewrite the history of the race. That history was forged by Team Sky and Froome, whose decision to race hard on Wednesday and Friday blew the standings to bits.It remains to be seen whether the 2018 Giro d’Italia could be yet another race in cycling history with an asterisk against it, yet another which counts for nothing.It is to avoid putting an entire race in limbo due to delay in resolving an Adverse Analytical Finding that the Mouvement Pour un Cyclisme Crédible, the sport’s voluntary anti-doping body, insists that its member teams do not field riders facing an AAF in races. As the 2017 winner and Froome’s runner-up this year, Tom Dumoulin, pointed out, if it had been him that was contesting a salbutamol ruling, he would not have been permitted to start the Giro.Team Sky have always refused to join the MPCC. (In the interests of fairness it should be pointed out that Simon Yates’s Mitchelton-Scott and the Astana team of the third finisher, Miguel-Ángel López, are among the World Tour teams who are not members either.) It is their legitimate right but it leaves them open to the criticism that they are putting their own interests above those of their sport. But in the last 18 months the team appear to have given little sign they are interested in the wider image of cycling, with their response to the tale of Jiffy Bags, lost medical records, the 55 doses of cortisone they bought between 2010 and 2013, and its climax in a highly critical – albeit strongly denied – parliamentary committee report.It is now five weeks until the Tour de France peloton gathers in the Vendée. There is every indication that Froome’s salbutamol ruling will not be complete by then. More contortions are in store, quite possibly lasting until late summer or early autumn. Unfortunately the Giro may be only the beginning of the end game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475e08a6610685093226859522aeece05624312c/0_99_3788_2273/master/3788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc9e8cbdaca7dd1e9056181bae4c5c45","title":"daniel ricciardo keeps composure win monaco grand prix","story":"As tales of sporting redemption go, few will have been harder to earn than Daniel Ricciardo’s very personal journey to the top spot of the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday. By the time the Australian had successfully persuaded the Prince and Princess of the principality to join him in swigging from a champagne bottle on the podium, his sheer joy was clearly infectious.A mixture of disbelief, relief and exhaustion were etched across his face, if indeed alongside the usual beaming grin that had been so notably absent when a win here had been so cruelly wrenched from his grasp two years ago.Even before the weekend began Ricciardo had been confident enough in the form of his Red Bull to talk of possible redemption for the incident in 2016 when a team pit stop error cost him victory. By race day he had done everything he needed to put it within his grasp. Quickest throughout practice and then untouchable in qualifying, Ricciardo had entered the race as clear favourite.He duly finished it on top, in front of Sebastian Vettel’s Ferrari in second and Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes in third, the order in which they had begun on the grid. The race was, as is often the case, something of a procession on the narrow streets of Monaco but was far from straightforward for Ricciardo.He had led from the off and looked to be fairly comfortable in front until he suffered a power problem on lap\u0026nbsp28 in the MGU-K. He was unable to use seventh and eighth gears, had to adjust his brake balance forward and needed to ensure he looked after his tyres as it became clear the race would have to be run with only one stop.His team were unable to resolve the problem and he had to drive the remaining 50 laps with absolute perfection and on a tight line to ensure Vettel had no way through, despite his power advantage.Passing is of course notoriously difficult in Monaco but Ricciardo still had to ensure he did not put a wheel wrong to claim the win. He did so and after 78 flawless laps under intense pressure from behind there is no doubt he and Red Bull had a real reason to celebrate on the occasion of their 250th grand prix.He had, as was the case in 2016, once again endured a rollercoaster of emotions in the cockpit to do so. “I expected my race to be over,” he said of the moment he lost power. “I was stressing out a little. Then I was thinking, ‘What do we have to do to win around here?’ That was not a good feeling and I couldn’t enjoy much of the race after that. I still don’t know how we got there.”Yet he did and his jubilant team principal, Christian Horner, compared it to Michael Schumacher’s remarkable second-place at Barcelona in 1994 when the German completed most of the race stuck in fifth gear. While it had still to sink in fully with the Australian he accepted the praise. “I think it was definitely my best weekend and the most satisfying,” he said. “There’s still a lot to process but as a whole this is probably the best weekend of my career.”He admitted it had been a race of control and that it was a case of managing his car and his performance rather than the flat-out charge that characterised his win in China. But for all that, when he does look back on Monaco he can consider that, while it very nearly left him broken-hearted again, this time he emerged triumphant and stronger than ever.Hamilton, whose lead over Vettel in the world championship has now been narrowed to 14 points, was less enamoured with the afternoon, concerned that having to manage tyres, the inability even to attempt passes and consequently slow lap times made for an uneventful race which he had not enjoyed.“I really am happy with the weekend. To come away with third, with a difficult weekend car-wise, I am happy. I am happy for Daniel as he is a great dude,” he said. “But Monaco has got the biggest build-up and is the most special race of the year and this is now a race gone for me.“Formula One needs to apply a different schedule here. It should not be a one-stop race, for example. From a racing driver’s point of view we were never pushing. It was insane how little I was pushing. I was 10\u0026nbspseconds behind but I am still conflicted because in my heart I want to win this race but the team just wanted me to bring the car\u0026nbsphome.”Kimi Raikkonen finished in fourth, with Valtteri Bottas in fifth, he Force India of Esteban Ocon completed in sixth and the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly was seventh. The Renaults of Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz Jr were eighth and tenth respectively, while Max Verstappen recovered well from starting at the back of the grid to finish in ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1606359f1c643b0ff24aca5f706e5803a26343e/0_224_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91454a6bc17bf422fe04dc6df6f05d3f","title":"dazzling lebron james carries cavaliers past celtics and into nba finals","story":"With another Game 7 victory at stake, LeBron James would not miss.

Jayson Tatum scored 24 for Boston, who were looking to return to the NBA finals for the first time since 2010. Al Horford scored 17 points and Marcus Morris added 14 with 12 rebounds for the Celtics, who led 72-71 with six minutes remaining before the Cavaliers scored 15 of the next 17 points to pull away.James and Horford embraced after the buzzer, then the Cavaliers donned NBA finals hats and Eastern conference championship shirts before shuffling off the court to receive their trophy. It’s not the one they want.The finals begin on Thursday at either Houston or Golden State. The Rockets host the seventh game of the West finals on Monday night. James had to do it without Kevin Love, Cleveland’s only other All-Star, who sustained a concussion in Game 6 and was replaced in the lineup by Jeff Green. Making his first start since the first-round opener against Indiana, Green scored 19 points and added eight rebounds the star of James’ starless supporting cast.The Celtics have had more time to get used to their injuries: Gordon Hayward has been out since the first game of the season, and Kyrie Irving has been sidelined since March.

From 2 June to 21 October the McManus will become the McMenace, with an exhibition celebrating the Beano, produced by Dundee publishers DC Thomson, as the comic reaches its 80th birthday.• Admission free, Albert Square, mcmanus The DCA was the cornerstone of the city’s cultural renaissance. When it opened in 1999 it was regarded with suspicion by some, but now, with its combination of art installations, creative learning programmes, a two-screen cinema, and a cafe bar with outside seating, it has become a destination that offers as much to fans of blockbusters as to chin-strokers. In combination with Creative Dundee, it has created Behind the Scenes, a walking tour giving backstage access to the city’s cultural venues and workshops, starting at the DCA and taking in Dundee Rep and the McManus.• Galleries free, 152 Nethergate, dca.org.ukOn the waterfront, and part of the £1bn redevelopment, Slessor Gardens is Dundee’s newest public space.

It also hosts outdoor gigs, with Steps in June, Rita Ora in July, Simple Minds in September, and more to be announced. There are quiet areas for city-centre contemplation and the Discovery Walk with bronze plaques paying tribute to local inventors and social reformers.• dundeewaterfrontDraffens was once the city’s department store of choice – it closed in the 1980s – and part of its basement now houses this speakeasy, with cocktails starting at around £8 (try the “corpse reviver”, a mix of gin with triple sec and absinthe). There is no official online presence (an unofficial Facebook page gives the location) but to save your shoe leather, it can be found down an alleyway called Couttie’s Wynd off Nethergate.

You will be served by some beautifully retro waiting staff, but the portions themselves, whether it’s morning toast or afternoon tea, are definitely post-rationing. Homemade soups, snacks, hot drinks and cakes are reasonably priced compared with the chain cafes, and the atmosphere adds extra value.• 11 Union Street, on FacebookThe brainchild of a University of Dundee student, OpenClose has provided local street artists with the canvas of neglected doorways on city centre backstreets. This has created two open-air art trails, with a location map of the 19 doorways available to download from the project’s website. The success of OpenClose has extended its reach from the city centre into other areas of Dundee, with artists bringing the forgotten doorways of Stobswell to life.• Free, openclosedundeeFor more than 40 years Groucho’s has welcomed and educated music lovers, watching its racks go almost full circle from only vinyl to predominantly vinyl with a hangover from the invasion of those pesky CDs.

He’s tiny, sitting on a\u0026nbspused syringe, on a cigarette butt, among the\u0026nbsptrash. Because he’s not in Wonderland, he’s in the gutter: a place where slang is the lingua franca.Jonathan Meades On Jargon (BBC Four) begins with a splendid and heartening defence of slang. Slang is centripetal, it gets to the core of what we actually think rather than what we are bullied into thinking (and not thinking). It is creative: “Slang is about showing off, about increasing one’s idiolect, about finding a better expression for blowjob than blowjob. It’s about flexing one’s lingo-muscle,” he says, flexing his also possibly – cunningly – finding a better expression for blowjob than blowjob. Fancy a lingo flex? No, maybe not better.Meades is immensely proud of adding to the already brimming store of words for drunk with “Badered” (ie legless, like the air ace), and to the sexual lexicon with “rubbing offal” for intercourse.Jargon, to Meade, means the “prissy net curtains of language”. The language of the trained liar, it is everything slang is not: “Centrifugal, evasive, drably euphemistic, unthreatening, conformist.” While slang belongs to the gutter, “jargon belongs to the executive estate,” he says. “It is the clumsy, graceless, inelegant, aesthetically bereft expression of houses with three garages … It is delusional, it inflates pomposity, officiousness and self-importance, rather than punctures them.”Ooh, that’s good isn’t it? Sometime you need to hit the pause button to properly appreciate a Meades missile, for it to sink in. Rewind and repeat. I also like “the more one sees of this end of humankind, the more one’s milk of human kindness turns sour”, and so much more.His tirade demonstrates how jargon has infected everything: politics and business – of course – law, journalism, television, football, football punditry, art, especially art ... It’s a pandemic. And, because you can’t separate jargon from its users, it’s a deliciously personal attack, too. Plenty to think about for: Boris Johnson, Theresa May, Philip May, George Osborne, Tony Blair, the Trump lout, the Trump lout’s counselor Kellyanne Conway, footballers Alan Shearer and Joey Barton, former Tate director Nicholas Serota (especially Serota, Meades really doesn’t like him), and so, so many more. You possibly, me certainly, it’s easy to allow it in, lazily. I’ll be running this through the jargon-check, and if any remains, it’ll be there knowingly and ironically, OK?It’s not just about what we say, it’s the way we say it. Regional accents come in for a surprise and unfashionable attack, they are “apartheid disguised as vibrant ersity”. Received pronunciation, RP, on the other hand is an instrument of social … hmmm … that needs a pause, to ponder.It’s meant to provoke, and does. It’s also blisteringly brutal, clever and hilarious. Meades is a rare thing on television: properly different. Sporadically he pops up to deliver a polemic in his inimitable style: deadpan, still, no walking towards you or waving his arms about, no TV cliches. The sunglasses have gone, sadly, perhaps the subject of jargon is so serious it requires eye contact.It still manages to be visually interesting on what looks\u0026nbsplike a budget of about forty quid. Little plastic figures mow and rub offal on the bonnet of a toy gold Range Rover. A rotting fish head is covered in flies, because jargon, too, begins at the top and putrefies downward. Careful, Serota might find the fish head relevant, buy it for a billion pounds and put it in a gallery, where\u0026nbspa cult of\u0026nbsppeople can come and spout incomprehensible guff about it. “We shall go on mocking,” says Meades, reassuringly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01879a1f09968611897e8031e2ee41ace4d0ef9/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75ba008b4290cf448719bae1c2775129","title":"north korea us summit on track says moon candid talks friend kim jong un","story":"Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that US negotiators were in North Korea for talks ahead of his planned summit with Kim Jong-un – a meeting the US president said was cancelled only three days before.“Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,” the US president tweeted. “I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!”The Washington Post first reported that the US officials had crossed into North Korea. The Post said Sung Kim, US ambassador to the Philippines, was with Allison Hooker, Korea expert on the White House National Security Council, and a Pentagon official and had met Choe Son Hui, the North Korean vice-foreign minister.Later, a state department spokeswoman said the US delegation was in “ongoing talks with North Korean officials at Panmunjom”, a village on the border between North and South Korea. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said a “pre-advance team” had left for Singapore to work on logistics. Before Trump’s supposed cancellation of the meeting on Thursday, the summit had been set for 12 June.On Saturday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in met Kim Jong-un in a surprise move. On Sunday Moon said Kim was committed to meeting Trump and achieving complete denuclearisation. Amid hugs and smiles, Moon met Kim on the North Korean side of Panmunjom, the site of their first meeting a month earlier. The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, showed how close the two leaders have become. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage the summit between Trump and Kim. On Saturday evening at the White House, as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested a climbdown was possible.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at 12 June in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA, was less sure Trump would have an advantage. He told ABC’s This Week: “Kim Jong-un knows his programme inside and out. I think he knows what he can concede. I don’t know that the president has done the kind of homework that would allow him to do this.” Discussing the Saturday talks, Moon said Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if it would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities, issues which have hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before earning concessions on sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression. Pyongyang prefers phased negotiations and concessions. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front of the Rodong Sinmun, the Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But Town warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” she said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” Moon said: “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one.” He added: “I’m sure we will succeed.”Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the Korean war, which ceased with an armistice in 1953. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of a nuclear test site this week. The two sides are set to hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c1773a736fe85e70414c223b51dbb0ddda64fa/0_154_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d957f7cd179dcb836045d3bd71861792","title":"thousands from far right and berlins techno scene face off in rival rallies","story":"German police deployed to keep anti-immigration AfD group and counter-protesters apart and avoid clashesThousands of demonstrators for and against the far right have faced off in mass rival rallies in Berlin, where calls of “we are the people” were met with chants of “go away, Nazis” and techno music.Police officers were deployed on Sunday to keep groups apart and prevent clashes, as leftwing militants vowed to “sabotage” the march by the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.On Twitter, Berlin police said they had to use pepper spray to stop demonstrators from trying to break down barriers separating the rallies at Berlin’s Leipziger square. They also announced bridge closures to avoid AfD demonstrators running into their opponents.The counter-demonstrations, organised under the banner “stop the hatred, stop the AfD”, were triggered by a call from the far-right party for its supporters to march in the capital “for the future of Germany”.According to the police, several thousand AfD supporters answered the call, assembling at Berlin’s main railway station shortly after midday, before making their way to the iconic Brandenburg Gate.Many of them were waving Germany’s black, red and gold flag and carrying blue balloons, the colour of the AfD.Their chants of “Merkel must go” and “we are the people” were occasionally drowned out by whistles, jeers and outstretched middle fingers from counter-demonstrators in side streets cordoned off by rows of police. The AfD march marks the first public show of strength by the far-right group since it became the largest opposition party.Leading AfD figures Jörg Meuthen and Alexander Gauland, who regularly rail against chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to let in large numbers of mainly Muslim refugees at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis, were expected to address the crowds.After initially predicting 10,000 AfD supporters would show up, organisers later said they would be happy with a turnout of 5,000.But thousands also joined the main counter-protest, staged by an alliance of political parties, unions, student bodies, migrant advocates and civil society organisations.Walking under a hot Berlin sun, supporters waved rainbow flags and carried banners with messages such as “no to racism” and “go away, Nazis”, while chanting “the whole of Berlin is against the AfD”.One of the loudest counter-demonstrations was organised by some 100 clubs from Berlin’s legendary techno scene, who were using boats and floats on the River Spree and a convoy of DJ-carrying trucks to “bass away” the AfD.“The Berlin club culture is everything that Nazis are not,” the group said in a statement. “We are progressive, queer, feminist, anti-racist, inclusive, colourful and we have unicorns.”Although the vast majority of counter-demonstrations were expected to be peaceful, members of the far-left ntifa movement had on their website called for “chaos”, urging sympathisers “to sabotage the AfD rally using all necessary means”.Berlin police have deployed 2,000 officers, drafted in from across Germany, to keep the peace.Founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, the AfD rose to prominence by capitalising on widespread anger over the arrival of over one million asylum seekers in Germany since 2015.It now holds more than 90 seats in the Bundestag where its presence has changed the tone of debate.This month, AfD co-leader Alice Weidel earned herself a formal rebuke from the parliamentary speaker for describing immigrants as “headscarf girls, welfare-claiming, knife-wielding men and other good-for-nothings”.Merkel’s left-right coalition government has responded to the AfD’s rise by tightening asylum policies, but the party continues to climb in opinion polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c2bbc132a348fba2cdc30b647ce8a86aab07e/0_3_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05e9b0831cf258f018487bc995f58a7","title":"colombia presidential elections ivan duque gustavo petro runoff","story":"Iván Duque, a fierce critic of the peace accord, will face-off against former mayor of Bogotá Gustavo Petro in second roundColombians have failed to elect a president outright, setting the stage for a bitter runoff between two frontrunners from opposite ends of the political spectrum, while a peace process with leftist rebels hangs in the balance.While voters were united in their distrust of establishment politicians, the campaign highlighted increasing polarisation, with Duque campaigning on a platform of market-friendly economics and Petro criticising the multinational mining companies that operate in the country.Some voters were also worried that with a leftist at the helm could mean their country follows neighbouring Venezuela toward economic ruin – a crisis that has caused more than a million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom many blame for that country’s woes.Sunday’s vote took on extra significance, marking the first presidential elections since a peace deal was reached between the government and leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). That deal formally ended five decades of war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced but failed to win over voters who in late 2016 rejected the deal in a referendum. The peace process was the initiative of outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel peace prize for his achievement.Though the deal was amended and ratified in congress, promises of softer sentencing for rebels and guaranteed seats in congress proved a step too far for many Colombians who saw Sunday’s vote as a second referendum.Duque – now the clear favourite to take the presidency in June – is opposed to the peace deal. His mentor and ally, former president Álvaro Uribe, remains a powerful figure in Colombian politics, having long been fiercely critical of the peace process.Petro once belonged to the long-defunct M-19 guerrilla group and supports the deal. But unless he can convince more moderates to swell his movement, his chances of winning next month are remote.Election day began in a leaden mood beneath a leaden sky, with Santos casting his vote in the courtyard of Bogotá’s magnificent neoclassical Congress building, and addressing reporters. “These are the best-attended elections ever,” he said, “in a country closer to peace than it has ever been.”He was followed, according to tradition, by his predecessor Uribe – whom Santos once served as defence minister but who has become his nemesis. Uribe placed his ballot paper and said: “I have voted for Iván Duque, because of his preparation for office, and his programme for security and respect for the law.” Soon afterwards, in the Asunción district on the edge of his electoral fortress in desperately poor barrios in the south of the city, Gustavo Petro arrived, pressing through crowds of supporters, to vote at the San Lucas school, converted to accommodate polling booths. “Uribe, can you hear us? Petro for president!” they chanted, and: “Gustavo, friend, the people are with you!” The candidate moved through his throng to the booth, accompanied by his daughter Antonella who was wearing the yellow colours of Colombia’s football team. “The future of all our sons and daughters depends on who wins this,” he said. “The more people vote, the more free citizens we will have. I promise a humane Colombia We will improve health and education, challenge corruption and pursue peace.” Duque had earlier voted at the National Institute of Pedagogy, as though to demonstrate the bitter polarisation in this country, proceeding to hear midday Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes church in the historic Chapinero district, where his well-heeled supporters packed the aisles. Duque was whisked in via a rear entrance by his armoured convoy, taking a front pew with his wife, Beatriz. A benediction was sung – bizarrely – to the tune of The Beatles Hey Jude and while the audience sat, upright, Duque lowered his head in prayer, before falling – while others stood – to his knees.The peace accord has had a rocky ride in the run-up to this decisive moment. Clause one commits a government to “integrated rural reform”, while clause four demands the voluntary and enforced eradication, and substitution of coca. Both have met with ferocious opposition: 160 indigenous and land rights leaders have been assassinated, and war rages over coca production between government forces and a mesh of mafia interests and Farc dissidents and other criminal syndicates connected to big landowners. The worst violence is in the Tumaco region on the Pacific coast, the most intensive – and contested – coca-growing region in the world. Duque has consistently refused to uphold both clauses, while Petro and Fajardo are committed to continuing the peace process.A final televised debate on Friday night focused almost entirely on the accord. Duque said it had “bamboozled the Colombians”, while Petro insisted: “The peace is not a problem of negotiation with the guerrillas, but an agreement with society to live without violence.” In a debate the previous evening, Fajardo said, aiming at Duque: “That would be a bad thing: a president who does not want peace.” Out in the countryside, the tension has been palpable. Carlos Castilla is one of those working on the front line of the accord’s implementation, for a ision of the agriculture ministry, helping coca growers substitute their crop with licit alternatives. “Peace”, he said, in the tropical wilderness around Tumaco, “is not something you just sign, it is something you build.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f734709fa66e665d0ed0457c030852b2af6600e/0_331_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a5c82bda2d493c7111774b1c4e8d3c","title":"new zealands five eyes membership called into question over china links","story":"US analyst says both major political parties have links to China’s Communist party amid fears over the growing influence of BeijingThe New Zealand government’s relationship with China has come under the spotlight after a former CIA analyst in the US said the nation’s participation in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance needs to be reconsidered.Giving testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission , Peter Mattis said Jacinda Ardern’s Labour party had accepted money from donors with links to the Chinese Communist party, while former prime minister Bill English had routinely briefed a National MP who was revealed to have worked at an institution that trained Chinese spies.“In New Zealand, both the last prime minister, Bill English, and Jacinda Ardern have denied that there’s a problem at all,” he went on.“I think that at some level the Five Eyes or the Four Eyes need to have a discussion about whether or not New Zealand can remain, given this problem with the political core.”The Five Eyes is an intelligence network made up of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.Nigel Haworth, the Labour party president, said he had no idea “what or to whom” the Mattis testimony was referring, and all political donations to Labour were above board and complied with the Electoral Act.“All party donations over $15,000, including who they are from, are listed on the Electoral Commission website for anyone to inspect,” Haworth said.The National leader, Simon Bridges, said it was “completely false” that former prime minister and National leader English routinely shared information.China expert Prof Anne-Marie Brady from the University of Canterbury has frequently warned of growing Chinese influence in New Zealand, a message echoed by Hillary Clinton on a recent trip to the country, saying New Zealand needed to take the threat “seriously”.“If a proud, independent democracy like New Zealand can’t deal with Chinese political interference activities, this is a really bad sign to the rest of the world of the way things are going,” said Brady, who has had her home and office burgled in thefts she has linked to her work on Chinese foreign influence.“Other countries are worried about New Zealand, and the apparent silence on the issue from our government ... New Zealand is the canary in the coal mine, if we can’t deal with it, who can?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510325.1527434014!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents to be surveyed on demand for non catholic schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Education Richard Bruton: this new process has ‘the potential to change the course of education in Ireland by providing a system which reflects the changing needs of families’. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Parents are to be polled over the coming weeks on whether they want multi-denominational patrons to take over the running of Catholic schools.The move forms part of a plan by Minister for Education Richard Bruton aimed at boosting choice for parents on where they send their children to school.At present, about 90 per cent of the State’s 3,300 primary schools remain under the patronage of the Catholic Church. However, demand for non-denominational schools – such as those run by Educate Together – has been growing strongly in recent years.Mr Bruton will announce on Monday that parents of pre-school children in 16 areas across the country will be surveyed on their school preferences.Census data has been used to identify areas where there is most likely to be a demand for multi-denominational or non-denominational schools.Efforts to est schools of Catholic patronage and provide greater choice for parents have proven slow and isive to date.For example, only 10 schools were ested from Catholic patronage under an ambitious plan launched six years ago aimed at expanding choice for parents.A revised plan drawn up by Mr Bruton last year differs by providing for the State to lease buildings from the church and to provide for “live transfers” of schools. It remains to be seen whether this will prove any more successful.The areas to be surveyed include: part of Dublin 1 Skerries, Co Dublin Bray, Co Wicklow Athlone, Co Westmeath Tullow, Co Carlow Kinsale, Co Cork LaytownBettystownMorningtonDonacarney, Co Meath Athenry, Co Galway KenmareSneem, Co Kerry Claremorris, Co Mayo BallybofeyStranorlar, Co Donegal Ennis, Co Clare Roscrea, Co Tipperary Waterford city Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan and Edenderry, Co Offaly.A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed.The surveys will be conducted by city and county childcare committees on behalf of the relevant Education and Training Board.Parents will have two weeks in which to complete the surveys, and all surveys are due to be completed by mid-June 2018.The survey results will form the basis of discussions with the patron body or landowner in the area – the Catholic Bishop in most cases – concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school to meet that demand. The response by the landowner or patron to demand for greater ersity will be included in the report prepared by the Education and Training Board.Mr Bruton said he believed this new process had “the potential to change the course of education in Ireland by providing a system which reflects the changing needs of families”.He added: “I urge all parties to engage in this process constructively, with a view to reaching solutions that achieve the wishes of all involved.”Following the publication of the first round of reports, there will be consultation with local school communities over the transfer of patronage of an existing school to a new multi- or non-denominational patron.Mr Bruton said identification of a new patron must reflect the wishes of parents and of the school community. “In each case, I believe that the best way to achieve this will be to hold a public meeting where each prospective patron can make their case to the school community, followed by a vote of all parents within that school community .Mr Bruton acknowledged that many denominational schools welcomed children of all beliefs and none. However, he said more ersity was needed to meet the changing needs of our population.“The new process will draw on the lessons from the previous model, such as the importance of live transfers and the downsides of having to await closures or amalgamations,” he said.He also announced that an “early movers” provision would enable school communities which had already decided to seek a transfer of patronage – independent of the survey process – to request their existing patron to apply to the Minister for a direct transfer of patronage.It is understood that a number of schools are considering transfers of patronage under this “early movers” provision of the schools’ reconfiguration process."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda forensic collision investigators expected on scene on Monday morningGarda\u0026iacute say they are investigating all circumstances surrounding the deathPricewatch: Expensive ice-cream is worth the taste but leaves a hole in the pocketRegina Doherty says \u0026lsquototal contribution approach\u0026rsquo requires consideration at policy and budget levelFormer judge Catherine McGuinness got anonymous letters calling her a \u0026lsquomurderer\u0026rsquoCheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fightOne woman was told by garda he would be too embarrassed to take her statementThe 2012 tragedy unified Irish women and feminist groups behind change on abortionMethod shown to be highly effective and safe when used up to 22 weeks of pregnancyUK must produce way of making backstop work that reflects December\u0026rsquos promisesEmails show department queried screening service\u0026rsquos view of Limerick woman\u0026rsquos actionLawyers highlight potential for \u0026lsquocyber staging\u0026rsquo evidence and social media problemsThe abortion issue has convulsed the country repeatedly since the 1983 referendumThe compactor technology means the smart bins can hold more than ordinary litter binsGeneral reason given for post-result support is they accept democratic will of the peopleFamilies sympathised \u0026lsquowith each other on tragic circumstances\u0026rsquo which led to two deaths"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510346.1527435312!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may told sidestepping backstop formula a non runner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: she  has been suggesting  that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Chris Kleponis Con artists have always been slithering around. Huckleberry Finn tangled with flimflam men on Mississippi riverboats. There was a flirty snake-oil salesman in Oklahoma!  And Marian the Librarian fell in love with a charming charlatan, professor Harold Hill, in The Music Man.It was all part of an amusing American tradition of rapscallions doing their little side hustles. But now narcissistic con artists are dominating the main stage, soaring to great heights and spectacularly exploding. We have one running amok in the Oval. And we have one who finally turned himself in at a Tribeca police station Friday. Shakespeare in Love was good. But Harvey in handcuffs was great. Harvey Weinstein spent many years prosecuting his nefarious schemes against women before women ensured his prosecution.Elizabeth Holmes shot to fame as the youngest female self-made billionaire after she dropped out of Stanford at 19 and then founded the company that became Theranos. She claimed to have created an easier, cheaper way to do blood tests, just by pricking a finger, but then it turned out she was a literal bloodsucker, defrauding investors of $700 million on a nonexistent technology. As Maria Konnikova wrote in her book, The Confidence Game, “The whirlwind advance of technology heralds a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change” when we are losing the old ways and open to the unexpected.We are easy marks for faux Nigerian princes now, when chaos rules, the American identity wobbles, and technology is transforming our lives in awe-inspiring and awful ways. Trump voters allowed themselves to believe they had a successful billionaire who knew the art of the deal when he only knew the art of the con. They bought his seductive campaign narrative, that the system was rigged and corrupt and only he could fix it. After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he’s made them all suckers.Those who ignored whispers about Weinstein’s grotesque behaviour burned to believe that Hollywood was more than juvenile comic-book movies, that it could still make classy, sophisticated films with great roles for mature actresses like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench. And despite tales of misogyny and sickening transgressions, they wanted to buy Harvey’s grand narrative, that he was a liberal feminist who could raise enough money to help elect the first woman president. With Holmes, people were longing for a young woman to break into the club of boy geniuses conjuring unicorns.She played to that, imitating Steve Jobs by wearing a black turtleneck and driving a car with no licence plate. She pitched a Jobs-like mythic story about her company, that it was not merely about making money, it was designed to be “the most important thing humanity has ever built.” High-minded elites like to scornfully say that Trump voters fell for his scam because they were ignorant and racist. But the high-minded elites fell for Holmes’s scam, even the fake deep authoritative voice she put on. Her board had George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and David Boies Rupert Murdoch and Robert Kraft were investors.“It’s a controversial thing to say now, but Holmes wowed all these older men and wrapped them around her finger with her charm and youth and good looks and cool vision,” says John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the scam story and who wrote a book, Bad Blood, about it. Carreyrou says Silicon Valley has always had “a flimflam element” and a “fake it ‘til you make it” ethos, from the early 1980s, when it was selling vaporware (hardware or software that was more of a concept or work in progress than a workable reality).“We’ve been lionising and revering these young tech entrepreneurs, treating them not just like princes and princesses but like heroes and icons,” Carreyrou says. “Now that there’s a backlash to Silicon Valley, it will be interesting to see if we reconsider this view that just because you made a lot of money doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re a role model for boys and girls.”Jaron Lanier, the scientist and musician known as the father of virtual reality, has a new book out, Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. He says the business plans of Facebook and Google have served to “elevate the role of the con artist to be central in society”.“Anytime people want to contact each other or have an awareness of each other, it can only be when it’s financed by a third party who wants to manipulate us, to change us in some way or affect how we vote or what we buy,” he says. “In the old days, to be in that unusual situation, you had to be in a cult or a volunteer in an experiment in a psychology building or be in an abusive relationship or at a bogus real estate seminar.“But now you just need to sign on to Facebook to find yourself in a behaviour modification loop, which is the con. And this may destroy our civilisation and even our species.”Lanier worries, now that tech has lost its halo, that there is nothing optimistic to replace it. “We don’t believe in government,” he says. “A lot of people are pissed at media. They don’t like education. People who used to think the FBI was good now think it’s terrible. With all of these institutions the subject of ridicule, there’s nothing – except Skinner boxes and con artists.”Read more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves

sparks new green revolution 100m investment","story":"A Zambian farmer holds maize enriched with vitamin A and drought tolerantBritain is helping breed a new generation of “super-crops” not only resistant to climate change, pests and disease but also fortified with vital vitamins and minerals.The initiative could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children who die each year from poor nutrition in developing countries as well as supplementing diets in the west.The Department for International Development (Dfid) has quietly invested more than £100m into breeding the new generation of super-crops which now stand poised to create what experts are calling a “second green revolution”.The crops include iron-rich beans that can withstand a 4 degree Celsius jump in temperature, “scuba” rice that comes back to life after two weeks underwater in flooded fields and drought-tolerant maize rich in vitamin A..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security France hails heroism of ‘spiderman’ migrant who scaled Paris building to save dangling four-year oldWest Midlands hit by flash floods overnightBank holiday Monday weather: UK could see hottest day of year so far after flash floods in Birmingham Girl, 18, died at Mutiny Festival \u0026#39after taking two pills\u0026#39 as second victim identified as a young fatherThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend\u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceLords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"giant panda cub makes first appearance","story":"A giant panda cub has made her first public debut aged five-months-old.

team denies claims match fixing test against","story":"Aneel Munawar in undercover recordings The England cricket team has been forced to deny outrageous match-fixing claims after a documentary alleged that a Test match against India was rigged. In an unprecedented statement, the English Cricket Board (ECB) said that there is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever in the face of claims of spot fixing during the 2016 match in Chennai. Tom Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the ECB, said that they had discussed the documentary claims with all of the players, adding: They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support.“Neither ECB nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) is aware any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.An undercover journalist, posing as a businessman looking to place bets on the match, filmed a match fixer claiming that he had three England players with whom he arranged spot fixes during the Test in 2016.Aneel Munawar, who is accused of working for organised crime syndicate D Company, was recorded boasting that he has been fixing matches for six or seven years and can fix up to 60 to 70 per-cent of matches with players in every team. I\u0027m telling you, each script I give you will happen, happen and happen, he said. Joe Root, England\u0026#39s Test Captain, described the allegations as \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39Just before the 2016 match began he called a middle-man working for the reporters to tell him how players would perform at certain points in the game. Though his predictions have not been revealed, Al Jazeera\u0027s documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers claimed that they were accurate. The England  players alleged to have been involved, who have not been named, told the documentary makers that they categorically deny allegations made by a source who is a known criminal.The fixers were also caught discussing  plans to rig the outcome of England’s first Test in Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin on November 6, by doctoring the pitch to make it impossible for the contest to end in a draw.Tharange Indika, a groundsman at Galle International Stadium, was suspended by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket whilst investigations take place. He denies all allegations against him.\u0027Spot fixing\u0027, which hit the headlines eight years ago when three Pakistan players were jailed over the practice in one of the sport\u0027s biggest scams, has become increasingly common in recent years as it is much harder to detect than throwing an entire match and provides more opportunity for bets. One former international cricketer previously accused of match fixing, whose identity was concealed, told Al Jazeera: They give them expensive gifts, like  Rolex watches. They give them houses, flats, cars.They send beautiful girls to the players, like models, so they get involved with them.He claimed that cheating players could earn up to £200,000 a game and were trapped into fixing matches. Joe Root, England\u0027s Test Captain, described the allegations against his team as ridiculous. I am aware that there is a documentary and it is outrageous that our players have been accused. All the players have the full backing of the ECB, he told a press conference. He said that they are concentrating on the cricket ahead of the second Test against Pakistan after losing Sunday\u0027s first Test, adding: “All the players have been briefed by the ECB, and been told there\u0027s absolutely nothing to worry about.Similar claims have been made against two Australian players in relation to their match against India at Ranchi in March 2017. Cricket bosses there have issued an equally vociferous denials. The ICC has launched an investigation into the claims made by the documentary, saying that it takes them very seriously.Repeated requests for disclosure of full evidence from the 18 month investigation have not yet been complied with, the governing body said. Munawar has declined to comment since undercover reporters revealed their identity. France hails heroism of ‘spiderman’ migrant who scaled Paris building to save dangling four-year oldWest Midlands hit by flash floods overnightBank holiday Monday weather: UK could see hottest day of year so far after flash floods in Birmingham Girl, 18, died at Mutiny Festival \u0026#39after taking two pills\u0026#39 as second victim identified as a young fatherThe 8 things you might have missed this weekend\u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceLords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000161998163_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mosul library isil torched rises slowly ashes","story":" A partially burned book lies on the floor in the Central Library at Mosul University, Iraq,Thumbing the pages of the stack of new textbooks on his desk, Mosul University’s director of libraries felt grateful for what they had but could not help but lament what was lost. The university’s Central Library once housed one of the most extensive collections of literature in the Middle East, and for 18 years Mohammed Jassim al-Hamdany had been its caretaker. But after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) seized control of the Iraqi city in the summer of 2014, Moslawis found themselves without a library and Mr Hamdany without a job.Staff and students fled, fearing what was to come.

And one in seven (14 per cent) thought plastic bottles were the main problem, the YouGov poll found.Suez said it wants producers to contribute more to the costs of collecting and recycling their products, such as coffee pods or pet-food pouches, and for them to operate refundable deposit systems for cans and plastic bottles.The UK\u0026#039s recycling rate has changed little over the yearsThe deposit scheme charging consumers a levy on their bottles or cans - which they can reclaim by returning them for recycling - should apply to on-the-go plastic drinks bottles less than 750 ml, and drinks cans, and the deposit should be set at 10p.Suez chief executive David Palmer-Jones said: We envisage a revolution, where the notion of \u0027waste\u0027 is consigned to the bin and, instead, we truly value the materials flowing around the economy.The advent of pay as your throw for black bag rubbish leaves a clear choice for households where they may see their council taxes rise if they throw away more that cannot be recycled. Or they may see a reduction in their bills because they will be recycling far more.We believe the opportunity for households to save money is huge if the Government follows through with clear proposals for it to make it far easier to produce more recyclable goods and make manufacturers more responsible for producing more recyclable products. Taking care of the environment makes economic sense too and we estimate could add £9 billion to the UK economy - placing this issue at the heart of a modern industrial strategy.France hails heroism of ‘spiderman’ migrant who scaled Paris building to save dangling four-year oldWest Midlands hit by flash floods overnightBank holiday Monday weather: UK could see hottest day of year so far after flash floods in Birmingham Girl, 18, died at Mutiny Festival \u0026#39after taking two pills\u0026#39 as second victim identified as a young fatherThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendButchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceLords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesTheresa May under pressure to change abortion law in Northern Ireland after Irish yes voteWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000164763456_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNoGXySPv9M1Jbe0Fc3Bi1Fk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"style pick lovers french women cope better middle aged says","story":"American author Pamela Druckerman discovered to her horror that middle age beckons after 40 when Parisian waiters and other strangers start calling her \u0026#34Madame\u0026#34 French women have cracked the midlife crisis from the way they dress to how they pick their friends or lovers, according to a Paris-based author whose book on why French Children Don\u0027t Throw Food became an international bestseller.In There Are No Grown Ups, American author Pamela Druckerman discovers to her horror that middle age beckons after 40 when Parisian waiters and other strangers start calling her Madame rather than “Mademoiselle”.“If you want to know how old you look, just walk into a French café.

None made last year’s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the staff at Smyths Toys, Which? said.The survey also asked shoppers what they liked about shopping in-store and found customers value being able to touch, feel and try on items before purchasing (82 per cent) and being able to ask staff questions (39 per cent).But customers said they were put off by crowds (49 per cent), queueing (49 per cent) and the behaviour of other shoppers (38 per cent).Ben Clissitt, Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”WHSmith has been contacted for comment.The top and bottom rated stores for 2018, according to the Which? survey of 10,356 shoppers is as follows. There needed to be at least 30 responses for a shop to make the table. Sample sizes are in brackets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers have been released onto the streets with no accommodation. One immigration law firm saying they were dealing with the problem on a daily basis.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the it was “cruel and callous” for the Home Office to hold asylum seekers with a right to live in the community in “prison style” removal centres, while Labour MP David Lammy said it was wrong to treat “innocent people like criminals”. It comes amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in detention, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.The government is already under intense scrutiny following the Windrush scandal, which revealed that Caribbean nationals who had lived in the UK for decades were wrongly detained in removal centres. As many as 5,000 Commonwealth citizens in Britain have since been identified as potentially having been deprived of their immigration rights.In January, the government repealed a law that had enabled homeless detainees to apply for accommodation from within detention if they had nowhere to reside when released. This meant around 2,000 detainees who previously applied for this support each year are no longer able to, according to charities.A separate accommodation provision is available for asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers if they would be destitute without it. But lawyers and groups working with detainees said this was difficult to obtain from within detention because they would fail the “destitution test”.One male asylum seeker was granted bail in March after spending 10 months in detention, but his application for asylum accommodation was rejected by the Home Office on the grounds that he was “not destitute by the fact that he is being housed and his dietary needs are catered to”.The refusal letter stated: “Detention is based around shared facilities (bedrooms, shower rooms and dining rooms) which is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation with lack of liberty being the main difference.”At least one person a day is self-harming in UK detention centresThe man’s grant of bail lapsed and he remained in detention.In another case, a man who came to the UK in 2003 after fleeing torture in his home country was granted bail in March on the condition that an address for accommodation would be provided by the Home Office.But the next day he was released with no address, and has since been relying on charities, asylum seekers and several iniduals of good will for support with housing and food.Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, told The Independent his team was seeing the issue on a daily basis.“What we’re finding is that that Home Office is failing to provide accommodation in time. There are massive delays in them providing the accommodation, we’re talking months,” he said.“Immigration judges decide all the conditions are right for the person to be released and they direct the Home Office to provide accommodation. But then we’re seeing nothing.”Mr Hossain said that because the Home Office can’t be held in contempt of breaching a bail order, the department was often failing to act on providing accommodation unless the detainee issued unlawful detention proceedings.“If they’re fortunate enough to get a decent lawyer who will issue unlawful detention proceedings, they can get an order from the high court saying the Home Office must provide accommodation within a set period of time, and it does miraculously find accommodation,” he added.“They’re not prioritising it is because they’re immigrants, and it obviously costs money to provide accommodation.  In the meantime, people languish in detention at the cost to the taxpayer. The harm caused to people who have a legitimate right to be released is inexplicable.”Claire Sullivan, research and policy coordinator and charity Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the vast majority of detainees the charity supports was no longer able to apply for accommodation support from the Home Office.Home Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdog“As a consequence, many detainees are being indefinitely detained for no other reason than their lack of suitable accommodation. Others have been released by the Home Office to the streets, potentially into destitution,” she added.“As well as no application process, there is no appeal right for refusals to provide bail accommodation. Further, the Home Office does not provide reasons for refusals.”Jerome Phelps, director of charity Detention Action, accused the Home Officeof creating a “bureaucratic black hole” for people in detention.“People we work with are finding themselves detained in prison-like conditions indefinitely, with judges powerless to free them. Decisions by judges to order release become meaningless if the Home Office fails to provide the necessary address,” he said.“The lack of a time limit on detention makes it urgent that the department return to respecting the release decisions of the independent judiciary.”Responding to the findings, Ms Abbott said: “We have a legal and moral duty to treat refugees with fairness and humanity, but day after day we see just how cruel and callous the Tories’ hostile environment policy has become.“Detention centres with their prison-style security are not appropriate accommodation for asylum seekers that have been given the right to remain. This practice must end.”Mr Lammy echoed her view, saying: “It is totally wrong that the Home Office are holding asylum seekers in detention centres and treating innocent people like criminals.“The principle of habeas corpus is the founding principle of our legal system, and yet in 2018 the Home Office is unlawfully depriving people of their liberty. It is time for a review of the hostile environment policy that underpins this cruelty.”A Home Office spokesperson said it was aware of some cases of detainees waiting for accommodation to be allocated and that they were working closely with the accommodation providers, police and HM Prison and Probation Service to source suitable accommodation.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation.” The review is to be led by Julian Glover, the former  journalist and chief speechwriter to the previous prime minister David Cameron. “Our protected landscapes are England’s finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them,” said Mr Glover.“The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can’t wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England’s landscapes beautiful, erse and successful.” Defra said the review will not consider weakening or undermining the current scope of the National Parks or their existing protections.“Undertaking a review is one of the key commitments of the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan, which outlines our vision for improving the environment over a generation by connecting people with nature and helping wildlife to thrive,” it said.The review was welcomed by both National Parks England and the National Association of AONBs.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

Brussels’ decision to kick the UK out of the scheme was angrily denounced by ministers, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, vowing to launch a separate satellite initiative if the EU refuses to back down.Tensions were already running high following days of strained negotiations in Brussels, during which one senior EU source described the UK’s demands as “fantasy”. Mr Hammond dismissed that remark as “not helpful”.Speaking at a legal conference in Lisbon, Mr Barnier noted the importance of agreeing how the relationship between the UK and the EU will be governed once Britain leaves the bloc.He said: “We have probably made a lot of progress on the substance of the withdrawal agreement, but without effective governance, these gains will be of limited value.“Because without agreement on governance, and without an agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.“The United Kingdom is well aware that our citizens and businesses, on both sides of the Channel, need legal certainty.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Hinting at continued frustration in Brussels over a perceived lack of detail in the UK’s negotiating demands, Mr Barnier urged ministers to be more “realistic” and warned them against playing a ‘blame game” with the EU.He said: “We also want an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom in the long term. But to achieve this, we need realistic proposals from the UK – proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.”He added: “For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It’s its decision. Not ours. And that has consequences.“The United Kingdom must look at the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.”Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe EU and the UK are at loggerheads over how disputes will be settled after Brexit. Britain wants to establish a joint committee, with members appointed by political leaders, to resolve any issues that arise, but European leaders have insisted the ECJ must be given the final say.Ms May has previously insisted: “The jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end.”In a sign of the continued distance between the two negotiating teams, Mr Barnier said: “We cannot accept that a jurisdiction other that the Court of Justice of the European Union determines the law and imposes its interpretation on the institutions of the Union.”The former French minister said the EU was open to the UK changing its stance, but that time was running out.He said: “If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it must tell us. The sooner the better.“We are asking for clarity. A negotiation cannot be a game of hide and seek.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Looking to allay investor concerns, Mr Mattarella vetoed on Sunday the parties’ choice of 81-year-old economist Paolo Savona as economic chief because he has been a vocal critic of Italy remaining in the euro.League party leader Matteo Salvini in recent days had virtually given an ultimatum over the economy minister pick to Mr Mattarella, whose duties as head of state include sanctioning a new cabinet. Mr Salvini told right-wing supporters he had refused to submit to a presidential veto of Mr Savona. Five-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the most seats at an inconclusive 4 March vote, demanded that parliament impeach Mr Mattarella and raised the spectre of political turmoil in the euro zone’s third biggest economy as a result. Barriers installed in Venice, Italy ahead of day of segregation of tourists and residentsThe 4 March election had failed to produce a party with enough support to govern single-handedly. Mr Salvini and fellow eurosceptic Mr Di Maio agreed this month to join their rival forces in a coalition to break the political impasse.With neither of them willing to back the other as prime minister, however, they ended up tapping political novice Mr Conte. The law professor at the University of Florence is a 5-Star Movement supporter. A presidential palace official, Ugo Zampetti, told reporters on Sunday night that Mr Conte ”has given back the mandate” Mr Mattarella had given him four days earlier to try to form a government.The economy ministry “always constitutes an immediate message of trust or alarm” for financial markets, Mr Mattarella said, adding that he had asked for someone who was not “supporting a position expressed more than once that could probably, or in fact inevitably, provoke Italy‘s exit from the euro”.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesMigrants wait to disembark from the ship Aquarius in the Sicilian harbour of Catania, ItalyIreland awaits the official result of a referendum that could end the country’s ban on abortion.

But there was one significant difference.Unlike almost all the previous state occasions he had overseen, Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding was to take place at Windsor Castle - a week after the Royal Windsor Horse Show had rolled through town and with the prospect of a royal baby thrown into the mix. It was time to start making a lengthy to-do list.                Royal wedding reception: Menu, speeches, \u0026lsquofilthy\u0027 jokes and dancing                When Harry first really met Meghan - ADAM HELLIKEROver at Kensington Palace, the royal wedding preparations had already started in earnest. Although the couple\u0027s decision to exchange vows at St George\u0027s Chapel was announced the very next day, aides had already started scoping out the 15th-century venue for ceremony, and exploring the idea of not one but two receptions, to be held on the grounds of the Queen\u0027s favourite royal residence.It immediately became apparent that like any bride planning her fairytale wedding, Meghan would need a right-hand woman and Amy Pickerill, 32, a smiley senior communications officer, was plucked from the palace\u0027s PR machine to become the former Suits star\u0027s Girl Friday, helping to plan the wedding alongside Harry\u0027s private secretary Ed Lane Fox.With the help of Kensington Palace\u0027s Communications Secretary Jason Knauf, like Meghan, an American, and Miguel Head, longstanding private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge, the pair had their work cut out, not only helping to plan a royal wedding but also overseeing Meghan\u0027s rapid introduction to royal life.As the royal couple made clear in their engagement interview with the BBC\u0027s Mishal Husain, Meghan planned to hit the ground running, and visits to every corner of the UK were quickly arranged with Meghan even becoming the first royal fianc\u0026eacutee to spend Christmas with the Royals at Sandringham.One of the first VIPs to be informed of the couple\u0027s plans was the Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the Most Reverend Justin Welby did not take it for granted that he would have some involvement in the royal nuptials, despite having officiated William and Kate\u0027s vows in 2011, the former parish priest predicted that he may well be called upon to once again lead wedding declarations that would be watched by an audience of billions around the world.Thankfully, he had had some recent practice, having married his press secretary Ailsa Anderson only three months earlier. The only problem was that that ceremony had not gone without a hitch. Despite being the most senior clergyman in the Church of England, the Cambridge-educated father-of-six caused a moment of panic by temporarily mislaying one of the wedding rings, which had rolled under a chair.I\u0027d better hold on tightly to the rings this time, he joked to Lambeth Palace aides charged not only with preparing him for the royal wedding but also another significant milestone in Meghan\u0027s conversion from American actress to royal bride: her baptism and confirmation into the church headed by her husband-to-be\u0027s grandmother.News that Windsor would be the royal wedding venue was greeted with a mix of excitement and trepidation by staff at the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.Having hosted the Queen\u0027s Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 and Prince Charles\u0027s marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles three years later at the town\u0027s Guildhall, the historic royal tourist trap was no stranger to major royal events but with some of the expected 5,000 members of the international media already descending on local hotels and businesses to buy up the best vantage points - a multi-agency task force was quickly assembled with Deputy Council leader Phillip Bicknell immediately identifying a major problem.Following a winter of heavy snowfall the pot-holed pavements and roads would not be able to withstand the 110,000 expected visitors let alone the 2.5-mile planned carriage procession along the High Street.Amy Pickerill helped Meghan to plan the wedding A plan was quickly put into action which saw 1,000 tonnes of material used to resurface the town centre roads, covering the equivalent area of two football pitches. In addition, Goswell Hill, a key venue for the day\u0027s celebrations would have to be pigeon-proofed.It\u0027s important that Windsor looks at its very best, insisted Councillor Bicknell, as councillors voted to push forward \u0026pound2.6million worth of improvement works which had been scheduled to be carried out in 201819.The 145-strong team of Crown Estate staff based at Windsor Great Park also knew they would have their work cut out.With the Long Walk due to be a focal point for the celebrations, not to mention play host to broadcasters from around the world, as well as the main BBC and ITV royal wedding studios, Keeper of the Gardens John Anderson immediately summoned the entire workforce, including clerical staff based in the Estate\u0027s London HQ, to descend on the 5,000-acre park to participate in a mass tidy up.We knew the Long Walk would be the focus of global attention so it was important that it looked its best. I immediately called an estate day of litter picking and tidying, he said. The 10-day mowing cycle was switched to weekly and Mr Anderson insisted that string was used to give the Long Walk a sharper edge down the sides.Harry\u0027s private secretary Ed Lane Fox worked with Amy Pickerill to organise the royal weddingJohn Anderson, Keeper of the GardensWe decided to take the grass in by a couple of inches either side to make sure it looked perfectly straight and as sharp as possible. Sometimes the grass creeps out a bit. People walk on it. It ends up looking a little weathered.With the couple keen for florist Philippa Craddock to incorporate Windsor foliage into the chapel flower displays, Mr Anderson also began to identify the best trees from which to take clippings.Normally we would have cut down some of the seedling trees but we left them so the foliage on offer was as green as possible.Later, in the days leading up to the wedding, Mr Anderson would find himself stress-testing sprigs of birch to see if they could withstand the unseasonably warm May weather and commandeering chiller vans to keep the wedding flowers and foliage looking as fresh as possible as temperatures topped 25 degrees celsius.It was not until January that Clare Waight Keller took the most important call of her career.PAClare Waight Keller was sworn to secrecy when designing and making Meghan\u0027s dressAs Givenchy\u0027s recently appointed artistic director, she had built up a career designing for Ralph Lauren, Gucci and Chloe - but nothing could have prepared her for landing the fashion commission of a lifetime as designer of Meghan\u0027s wedding dress.The married mother of three was banned from telling anyone about the top secret project - even her husband, US architect Philip Keller, who only found out with the rest of the world on the morning of the wedding.Throughout eight or nine meetings with the bride-to-be and despite spending a staggering 3,600 hours working on the dress and intricate hand-embroidered 16ft veil, she managed to keep it under wraps.It certainly helped that the bookmakers and media were all chasing a red herring, with the British-based Australian design duo Ralph \u0026amp Russo wrongly reported to be behind the wedding gown after designing the \u0026pound56,000 dress Meghan wore for her engagement photographs at Frogmore House.Frogmore, however, was to play an even more important role in the wedding celebrations after the couple picked the 300-year-old royal retreat for their second, more intimate evening reception.NCMaster of the Royal Household Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt was key in preparationsMuch like the FA Cup final on the same day - it was decided the wedding would also be a game of two halves - with William\u0027s participation at the crucial football tie still hanging in the balance.As master of the Royal Household, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt was already knee-deep in preparations for both receptions by the time Kensington Palace announced the finer details in February.Liaising with the Comptroller Sir Anthony and the household\u0027s head chef Mark Flanagan, it was decided that the Queen would host the lunchtime reception for 600 guests at St George\u0027s Hall, while Prince Charles would put on the more intimate evening sit-down dinner for just 200 of the couple\u0027s nearest and dearest.As with any bride and groom, Harry and Meghan took a leading role in choosing the food, insisting on a modern day twist on traditional fare by serving bowl food for lunch.Some 30 kitchen staff were recruited for the big day and by the Thursday night before the wedding, they had already washed and peeled the vegetables, and got other produce ready.The day Lady Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales was the wedding of the century. Here is their wedding days compared in pictures.                     Getty Images1 of 14Meghan Markle on her wedding day to Prince Harry, May 19, 2018It\u0027s the minimum amount of cooking and maximum amount of presentation time, said Mr Flanagan, who has been cooking for the Queen, her family and guests since 2002.Harry and Meghan even visited Windsor Castle to sample the menu, which included a selection of canapes followed by a choice of fricassee of free range chicken with morel mushrooms and young leeks, pea and mint risotto with pea shoots, truffle oil and parmesan crisps or 10-hour slow roasted Windsor pork belly with apple compote and crackling.While all this was going on, royal cake maker Claire Ptak was gathering the ingredients for her elderflower and lemon sponge.The former market stall holder-turned-Hackney-based artisan baker, who was specially chosen by fellow Californian foodie Meghan to create the buttercream iced masterpiece, had to source 200 Amalfi lemons, 5,000 eggs and 10 bottles of elderflower cordial from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Norfolk before even embarking on the five-day mission to create the \u0026pound50,000 cake, with the help of no fewer than six assistant bakers.Then came the task of sourcing three types of Meghan\u0027s favourite peonies - Madame Claude, Bowl of Cream, and the aptly titled Duchess - in shades of white and cream to decorate the cakes, along with four different white and cream roses - Patience, Purity, Jeanne Moreau and Princess Miyuki. Claire previously admitted she hadn\u0027t made a back-up cake in case of a disaster, saying: It\u0027s cake. It can\u0027t go that wrong.PAClaire Ptak created the \u0026pound50,000 lemon and elderflower wedding cakeThe latest major press briefing came just two weeks before the wedding as media outlets from around the world were putting the finishing touches on specially-made royal wedding studios both in Windsor town centre and along the Long Walk - where thousands of royal watchers were due to descend to watch the noon ceremony on 13 big screens.With more than 100,000 revellers expected to picnic on the site during the day, 68 catering units were set up alongside 746 extra toilets.By now 250 members of the Armed Forces had been specially selected to take part in the 25-minute carriage procession and were being put through their paces by Major General Ben Bathurst, general officer in command of the Household Division, who planned the entire military effort sitting at the Duke of Wellington\u0027s old desk at his office at Horse Guards.The broadcasters were also trying to pre-plan their coverage with military precision. One network insisted on removing the windows from the Harte and Garter pub to guarantee an unrestricted camera view of the proceedings.The US broadcaster NBC went a step further, building a huge riser on the top of the Macdonald hotel, having secured the prime position looking down on the steps of St George\u0027s chapel following a bidding war with rivals CNN.Hundreds and thousands of pounds were spent reinforcing the roof to ensure the timber-framed hotel could withstand not one but three makeshift TV studios belonging to the NBC\u0027s family of outlets including sets for Access Hollywood and the Canadian broadcaster CTV.Having given Harry and Meghan three or four marriage guidance sessions in the run up to the day - not to mention helping them plan the order of service - the Archbishop of Canterbury was on more than friendly terms with the couple by the time it came to their wedding rehearsal on the Tuesday before the wedding. An insider described the bridesmaids and page boys as a little over excited as they practised their slow walk down the aisle.Across the pond as Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was preparing to fly to London from Los Angeles, American preacher the Most Reverend Michael Curry was at his Chicago home adding the finishing touches to the six and a half minute sermon he had written on his iPad after being asked by his friend, the Archbishop to give the address.As the first black bishop to be appointed to the US Episcopalian church, the father-of-two and equal marriage campaigner was no stranger to making history - but nothing could have prepared him for the reaction to his power of love speech - which he ended up completely ad libbing after being carried away by the emotion of the day.Having undertaken a second rehearsal without the couple on Friday, James Vivian, the director of music at St George\u0027s Chapel, was feeling quietly confident about the by now well-practised works of Sir Hubert Parry, Sir Edward Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Johann Sebastian Bach that Prince Charles had helped the couple select for the hour-long ceremony.Royal wedding highlights: The best photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.

Dress designer Clare Waight Keller knew she had done a good job when Harry came up to her after the ceremony and said: Oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning.Having spent just 45 minutes arranging Meghan\u0027s hair into a messy bun with a pack of \u0026pound1 pins, hairdresser Serge Normant was left reminiscing on a day you can only dream of.PAThe wedding day was praised as being one of the most progressive royal events in recent memoryBy the time Meghan was posing for her official wedding photographs, make-up artist Daniel Martin, who had worked with her for 10 years, was in tears. I was almost like she looks at me and said, \u0027What did you think? How\u0027d it go?\u0027 And I lost it.The couple had barely said I do before the clean-up operation began in earnest, with 13 tonnes of waste collected by an 80-strong council cleaning team beginning as soon as the crowds started to disperse as the couple\u0027s horse drawn Ascot Landau disappeared through the castle gates.Similarly, the TV sets that had taken weeks to construct were dismantled within hours of the final live broadcasts, with some American anchors flying back home on the night of the wedding, as Harry and Meghan were making their way to their evening reception in a zero-emissions electric E-Type Jaguar.It was around midnight when the skies above the castle were lit up with fireworks, signalling the end of an extraordinary team effort which saw Windsor host one of the most successful events of an illustrious royal history dating back more than 1,000 years."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/charlie-van-straubenzee-prince-harry-royal-wedding-965850.jpg","title":"charlie van Straubenzee prince harry meghan markle royal wedding reception ludgrove school","story":"Mr Van Straubenzee recounted that he arrived at the school to find the prince was their dorm monitorCharlie van Straubenzee raised a glass to 33-year-old and his stunning 36-year-old wife in a hilarious roast where he not only poked fun of the prince\u0026rsquos flame-coloured hair but also gave guests an insight into their time together at Ludgrove School in Berkshire.Mr Van Straubenzee recounted that he arrived at the school aged eight to find the prince was their dormitory monitor, and a strict one at that.Mr Van Straubenzee said: \u0026ldquoAll I wanted was a cuddle form my mummy.\u0026ldquoInstead, Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out onto the roof.He added: \u0026ldquoLadies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined?Mr Van Straubenzee, 30, referred to Harry as \u0026ldquoour strawberry blonde prince during the hilarious speech.He said: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos face it - Harry\u0026rsquos a ginger.\u0026ldquoHe was in denial for years when he was young and used to hate other gingers.Charlie van Straubenzee raised a glass to 33-year-old and his stunning 36-year-old wifeOn a more serious note, van Straubenzee spoke of seeing his friend experience the loss of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.One guest said: \u0026ldquoHe described how awful it had been for Harry to go through everything and how he has come through it.

Last week Marks \u0026amp Spencer announced it was closing 100 high street stores and the DIY chain Homebase was sold for just \u0026pound1 by Australian owner Wesfarmers, which cut its losses to \u0026pound1billion.

We don\u0027t wait for the store to need a new coat of paint, we do it in advance so it always looks good.When customers come in they are still spending money, but the drop in footfall into the town centre has hit us hard.The father-of-one is also baffled by business rates for one of his stores remaining about the same for the last four years, while the property tax for the second has gone up by 40 per cent.He said: The problems for independent traders on the high street started with Tony Blair giving carte blanche to out-of-town retail parks, but even they are now struggling in the face of online competition. The harsher trading climate has not been helped for us by Blackpool town centre looking run-down and having roadworks weeks before our summer sales start, making it difficult for our customers to reach us.A lot of the roadworks have been caused by a \u0026pound22million project funded by the Government for a tram to run from the train station to the promenade, which is just a six-minute walk. This money would have been better spent on a parkand-ride scheme to allow people easily to get into the town.MATTHEW POVERThe lack of footfall on the high street has hit Lefton\u0027s Furniture Group hardBlackpool council deputy leader Gillian Campbell said: We have well-documented plans for improving the town centre, evidenced by the number of development projects already completed or that will come to fruition over the next two years.These include the development of a new conference centre, new town centre hotels, a cinema alongside additional retail and restaurant facilities at Houndshill, an integrated transport interchange at North Station and the improvement of key streets.All of this is much-needed investment that will improve the visual appeal of the town centre and give businesses and shoppers more compelling reasons to come to the town centre.If you are a shopkeeper or shopper with concerns about the future of your high street, write to Jon Coates, Sunday Express, Northern \u0026amp Shell Building, 10 Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6EN or email jon.coates@express"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Trolley-965755.jpg","title":"May Bank holiday 2018 opening times supermarkets open","story":"GettyIt\u0026rsquos best to double check your local branch details onlineAs always, it\u0026rsquos best to double check your local branch details online in case they\u0026rsquore running things a little differently.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We haven’t made a decision yet”.But he also suggested a deep split remained on the move, adding: “We’ve been pretty clear that there are deficiencies in the Norway model that might not work for a bespoke UK deal”.The EEA threat is a second major challenge for Mrs May’s Brexit plans, after pro-EU Tory MPs also pledged to vote with Labour to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU.Tory Brexit minister Steve Baker dubbed Mr Watson’s remarks as “the latest sign that Labour are trying to frustrate Brexit”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.Former security minister Admiral Lord West said: Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning.

I am everything and nothing. This has big advantages. Every day is different.”He describes himself as being in a “domestic partnership” since January 2015.A PayPal account he advertises on social media where he urges people to “send money to Jesus” currently stands at zero.A spokesman added that any complaint would normally be lodged with a local court who would then send officials to notify squatters they must leave.A source said: In most cases the court officials go alone. They usually don’t call for police back-up.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409381089.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wh smiths uk worst high street shop 2018","story":"The chain has been ranked in the bottom two for the eighth consecutive year, with critics slamming its poor customer service, bad value for money and generally dire state of its stores.The annual survey by consumer champion Which? comes after the retailer was slammed for selling £1 toothpaste for £8 in its hospital outlets.One customer told Which?: “I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating.”Another said: “I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.”Another shopper summed up the retailer’s troubles, branding it “hugely inferior to what it was in the past”.Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.The customer scores given are based on customers’ experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop.Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn’t even manage last year’s top 10.Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the “friendly and cheerful” staff at Smyths Toys.Last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively.Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010.But the department store’s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty.Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings.Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money.Clintons- 60%Evans - 63%= Sport Direct - 63%Homebase/Bunnings - 64%JD Sports - 65%= Toys R Us/Babies R Us - 65%Dorothy Perkins/Burton - 66%= Halfords (inc Cycle Republic) - 66%= Miss Selfridge - 66%= Ryman- 66%Lush - 81%= Savers - 81%= Smyths Toys - 81%Screwfix - 80%= Toolstation - 80%Bodycare - 79%= Richer Sounds - 79%The Perfume Shop - 78%= Waterstones - 78%The Body Shop - 77%= Dunhelm 77%= Ikea 77%= John Lewis 77%Describing their bugbears of shopping in store, shoppers said they are put off by crowds (49%), queueing (49%) as well as the behaviour of other shoppers (38%).While some high street retailers are thinking up new ways to entice customers into their stores, others are struggling.

Magazine Editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”The Sun Online has contacted WH Smith for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408258651.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fat brits should be more like mick jagger you dont see a 20st rolling stone","story":"Jamie Oliver is usually wheeled out for some well-intentioned finger-wagging whenever there is another bout of hand-wringing about our nation’s ever-expanding waistline.But Mick, 74, has a 28in waistline.And Jamie Oliver has not had a 28in waistline since he was 12.Government ministers should be begging Jagger to come to Downing Street to learn all he knows about nutrition and exercise.The media should be quizzing Mick for his reflections on current levels of sugar in biscuits and chocolate.And all of us should be looking at Mick and marvelling at how fit an elderly gent can be.I saw the Rolling Stones perform twice this week at the London Stadium and Jagger was a leaping, bounding, skipping, run-ning, jumping, jaw-dropping revelation.And fuelled by nothing stronger than a bowl of pasta, he kept it up for two hours.We learned this week that half the country will be dangerously overweight by 2045. Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”.

We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

Former Energy Minister Greg Barker, now a peer, is raking in tens of thousands as chairman of En+ Group. MPs last night called our revelation “deeply troubling” and urged the Tories to act. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week raised concerns about energy giant En+, which is “controlled by billionaire and Kremlin associate Oleg Deripaska”. Their report on Russian “dirty money” in the UK came just weeks after Donald Trump slapped sanctions on En+ and Mr Deripaska – a close ally of President Putin. The Mirror can disclose that Lord Barker, who quit as MP for Bexhill and Battle in 2015, agreed to become chairman of En+ in October.  MPs said its flotation on the London Stock Exchange a month later was an example of “contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. The Mirror revealed last week that former Tory leader William Hague is a paid advisor to a law firm which “facilitated” En+’s controversial flotation. The FASC last week warned the UK is turning a “blind eye” to Russia’s “dirty money” and putting national security at risk. MPs also said London was being used to hide the “corrupt assets” of President Putin and his cronies.

Logan Johns-Evans was rushed to hospital after his mum Jade Johns found him unresponsive when she went to wake him up for school. She said the youngster had smoked a rolled-up cigarette but he had no idea the synthetic drug Spice was put in it as a joke.  Ms Johns told Wales Online that her son reacted as though a “monster had taken over his body” - and she\u0027s shared shocking photos showing him unconscious in his hospital bed.   The mum, from Wildmill, South Wales, said the drug could not be tested for in her son\u0027s urine or blood, but doctors checked his symptoms and made a clinical decision that he was suffering from the effects of Spice. The drug can cause fast heart rate, vomiting, confusion and violent behaviour, although many users are often pictured slumped over in town or city centres looking like zombies. Ms Johns said she and her family were beside themselves with worry as her son lay unresponsive in a bed at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Ms Johns said: “He woke up at 3am and I thought he was sleepwalking because he was trying to make his way out the door and he was making no sense. “I put him back to bed and at 6.40am I went to wake him up for school and he couldn’t speak or stand so we whisked him to hospital. “He was in resus on high dependency. He was like a zombie. A monster had taken over his body and he had so much strength it was unreal.  “It was scary because he couldn’t speak and there was nothing in him. There was no response to his eyes or the light in his pupils, the only way you could describe it was like a zombie because nothing was making sense. “In hospital he became angry and he had so much strength but the doctors said he didn’t know what was going on. It wasn’t an 11-year-old child inside that body. “My daughter told me he had been smoking and someone came forward to say someone had put Spice in his rolly as a joke.” Around 33 hours after arriving at hospital, Logan came around and became his normal self but he had no memory of what had happened and believed he had only just arrived at hospital.

Apparently a lot of commentators were saying \u0027It\u0027s an Emilia Wickstead dress\u0027.  She even took a dig at the fit of the bride\u0027s dress and Meghan\u0027s hair-do.  Speaking to the Daily Mail, she fumed: If you choose a simple design the fit should be perfect. Her wedding dress was quite loose. And speaking of the Duchess\u0027s hair, she said: I was like, \u0027hold the wisps back — it\u0027s a royal wedding for God\u0027s sake\u0027.  Her comments led to a barrage of complaints on Twitter. A Meghan fan account wrote: Call me petty but after this I hope that Meghan never wears Emilia Wickstead again. Rude!

Joshua Connolly-Teale, 16, passed away on a camping trip near Dewhirst Road in Syke, Rochdale, yesterday morning, the Manchester Evening News reports.   Emergency crews descended on a field in the area after police received reports of concerns for the welfare of a teenager shortly before 11.15am.  They sadly discovered that Joshua had died. Three other teenagers were hospitalised for treatment and have since been discharged, police say. Officers are now investigating the circumstances surrounding Joshua\u0027s death - as his heartbroken mum has paid tribute to her wonderful and loving son. “He was lovely,” said grieving mother Joanne Teale.  “We are really, really proud of him and we’re really going to miss him so much.” Cheeky Joshua was in the middle of his GCSE exams and was taking a break from revision when he left his home in Rochdale on Friday night. He had been working hard and cramming for the tests, and had sat an exam on Friday morning before taking the break from his revision schedule. The teen told his mum he would spend the night camping with three friends and two adults in fields in the Syke area to the north of the town. But yesterday morning, emergency services were scrambled to the field and discovered that the schoolboy had tragically passed away. According to Joanne, Joshua was on track to get some good results and had been looking forward to studying game development at Hopwood Hall College. The St Cuthbert’s RC High School pupil loved art and IT.  He was also a keen video gamer, and enjoyed playing football with his sisters, trampolining and fishing with his dad, Geoff. He had recently celebrated the birth of his sister Becca’s little girl, Madison. Joanne said her son was delighted to be an uncle and doted on baby Madison. She said: “Josh really loved her. He was really good with her and was looking forward to spending time with her. He was so pleased and proud to be an uncle. “He was close to his brother and all his sisters, especially Lauren because they were about the same age. She said her boy was excited to push little Madison around in her pushchair. “He had a lot of mates and he was really funny, she added. We used to call him Victor Meldrew if he was being grumpy. And he would tickle me to make me jump - he was funny.

As boy soldiers in 1958, thousands of this country’s fittest young men were ordered to a tropical paradise to take part in the biggest military operation since D-Day. Today they have been honoured by the impoverished islanders who still live in the testing grounds – while in the UK successive governments continue to obstruct calls for official recognition. Ron Watson, 79, organised the trip to remind the British they are still fighting. He said: “A medal doesn’t take away the problems people had when they came home. But it relieves the psychological pressure we have been under for 60 years. “An official medal recognises that we made a sacrifice for our country. When you go to war in Afghanistan you know the risks – but in the nuclear tests we had no idea. Nobody did. We were the guinea pigs.” To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .  Former Royal Engineer Ron was just 19 when he was part of Operation Grapple, the crucial campaign to build a hydrogen bomb. It was held on a coral island 2,000 miles south of Hawaii, where a total of 22,000 servicemen were ordered to build the infrastructure for, and bear witness to, dozens of nuclear tests. Ron, like all the others, wore little but shorts and boots as they were ordered to muster with their backs to the beach, squat down and cover their eyes. “There was a flash so strong you could see the bones in your fingers like an X-ray,” said Ron, from Warboys, Cambs. “Then a terrific heatwave like an electric heater being waved across your bare back, a crack and a rumble. Fellers who stood up too soon were knocked to the ground by it all. When we were told to stand and look, there was a great ball of fire in the sky. Afterwards we just got on with the day job.” Ron lost all his teeth within two years of returning home. He and his daughter have both had tumours removed their thyroids – the organ where radiation is known to accumulate. And his wife suffered two later-term miscarriages, which led to divorce. Research has shown a third of the test vets were dead before 1999, many in their 50s from radiogenic cancers. A 2007 study found their wives report three times the normal number of miscarriages. They have an estimated 155,000 descendants, who suffer 10 times the usual amount of birth defects.   Now four of the Cold War heroes have made a pilgrimage to the testing grounds at Christmas Island – since renamed Kirimati - to mark the 60th anniversary. Along with Ron were former RAF technician Leslie Hawkins, 81, from Horley, Surrey, and another two ex-Royal Engineers Robert McCann, 79, from Romsey, Hants, and Ray Carbery, 80, from the Isle of Man. Ray, who has constant bowel problems and a severely autistic son, said: “What people don’t realise is they didn’t send the weedy guys. They gave us all medicals first, we were the healthiest they had. “The surprise isn’t that some of us aren’t so bad, it’s that so many healthy men aren’t here any more. Whatever happened on Christmas Island killed the fittest lads in the armed forces. Out of the 12 in my unit, half died of blood cancer.” The veterans took with them toys and books for the schoolchildren, as well as blood pressure monitors, surgical gloves and stethoscopes for the hospital, all paid for from their own pensions. They were feted by the island’s political leaders, shown demonstrations of local dancing, and taken on a tour to the south of the island to find the wreckage left behind by the British: rusting metal huts, overgrown bunkers, and concrete plinths to which bomb balloons were tethered.  And at a special commemoration service, they were invited to dedicate a new memorial built by the islanders. Speeches were exchanged and the four old soldiers bore the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association Ron said: “It’s ironic that that the o.nly people prepared to recognise what we did are on the other side of the world. Our own government doesn’t have the decency to do the same.” In the UK no nuclear test veteran has ever been invited to meet a Prime Minister. Around 90% of those who seek war pensions are refused, and despite the MoD’s scant records are required to provide proof of their radiation dose. And more than \u0026pound17m has been spent fighting successive court claims and war pension appeals. Leslie has made three return trips to Christmas Island but says this will be his last. He said: “We’re probably the last ones who’ll ever make that journey, so it was important to go. “It would be nice to have a medal rather than have it swept under the carpet. There’s not many of us left so it wouldn’t cost much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire tories defenceless military","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Tories defenceless on military pay cutWeakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely ­self-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor22:06, 27 MAY 2018NewsopinionZero hours contracts have become an increasing curse (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOffhand Tory Caroline Dinenage’s contemptuous dismissal of desperately low-paid local women being cheated of \u0026pound500 a year tells a bigger national scandal. The brazen Gosport MP and junior Health Minister is proving an enemy rather than an ally as cooks and cleaners at military bases on \u0026shyPortsmouth Harbour fight a contractor’s dirty tricks. This column last October revealed the plucky Fort Blockhouse group’s brave if unequal fight against ESS, part of Compass Group with a Fat Cat \u0026pound5.8m boss, after the corporate bloodsuckers unilaterally decided to stop paying them for two weeks of the year. I regret to report deadbeat Dinenage fobbed off the women when they asked for help, doing the bare minimum as far as I can see in writing to junior Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood then forwarding his worthless reply to a union official without the courtesy of a covering letter. Acknowledging “strength of feeling”, Ellwood added offence to \u0026pound500 injury – two weeks’ pay – by hiding behind MoD contracts, deals granting bad employers green lights to short-change loyal staff. Unite regional officer Bob Middleton’s judgement that the Tory pair “washed their hands” of indefensible abuse is bang on the money.  Gosport is a small piece of a large jigsaw as exploitation at work spreads rapidly and proliferating zero hours contracts become an increasing curse. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady says she’s met Germany’s powerhouse Angela Merkel more often in the last two years than she has Theresa May. A Tory PM who sees CBI business chiefs monthly, but grants a sole audience to the champion of six million workers, betrays the anti-grafter mentality of Conservativism. May, Dinenage, Ellwood and too many of their Tory colleagues instinctively identify with the boss not the bossed, the exploiter not the exploited. Weakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely \u0026shyself-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old.

It feels like we are imprisoned in our own house. “The fence is 2ft from our front window – it’s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.” “We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.  We bought [the house] because of the view, which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence. Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair.” He continued: “We’re not even sure we want to live here now. “We keep the curtains closed in the front room, and spend most of our time upstairs. Even if the fence gets taken down, there is no guarantee it won’t come back later.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rogue green heineken ecstasy tablets","story":"News\u0027Rogue GREEN HEINEKEN ecstasy tablets\u0027 blamed for deaths of two people at Mutiny FestivalEXCLUSIVE: Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan both fell ill just 20 minutes apart but sadly died at the music event in Portsmouth, Hants\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam Aspinall21:32, 27 MAY 2018Updated23:07, 27 MAY 2018NewsThe Green Heineken ecstasy tablets were being taken at the festival, it\u0027s claimed (Image: Alamy)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRevellers are tonight blaming a batch of rogue ecstasy tablets for the death of two people at a dance music festival this weekend. Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan - aka Tommy Bakeer - were both rushed to hospital after falling ill just 20 minutes apart at Mutiny Festival but sadly died. There are claims tonight that people were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A total of 15 people at the dance music festival were taken to hospital, with one still in critical condition and organisers cancelled the festival today over safety concerns. Just hours after Georgia’s death, her heartbroken mother posted a tribute to her daughter who was “full of life” and urged other drug users to learn from her death. She said her daughter suffered a 45-minute long fit after taking ‘two pills’ at the event in Portsmouth, Hants, where headliners included Dizzee Rascal on Saturday night, and Craig David due to headline on Sunday.  Hampshire Constabulary said the two deaths, which are not being treated as suspicious, were separate incidents before organisers cancelled the rest of the festival this morning. Eyewitness Sam, 20, revealed that people were taking ecstasy tablets nicknamed “Green Heinekens” at the festival and that is what is believed to have caused the emergency. He said: “I saw the girl on the ground being treated by paramedics, it was a horrendous sight, she was in a very bad way. “People said she may have had two pills and if they were the Green Heinekens I can see why as my friend only had one and he was in a right state afterwards. “We had not heard anything about any drug warning, but as soon as people started getting ill it was blamed on the Green Heinekens.”  Mutiny Festival, held at Portsmouth’s King George V playing fields, was expected to attract 30,000 revellers over the course of the two-day event. On Thursday, just two days before the pair died, police said they would be clamping down on drugs at the event. Tributes have since been flooding in to the two young adults. Janine Milburn, Georgia’s mother, said “my little girl was 18 and full of life” and “I just hope this stops at least some of you ending up the same”. Her heartbreaking post read: “As I have now spoken to family members I can now say Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny. “If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever.” She continued: “The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 mins. “This then caused her muscle to break down and turn her blood acidic. Her heart was irregular and stopped numerous times and then her lungs filled with blood and fluid and I made the decision to turn everything off. “My little girl was 18 and full of life, I just hope this stops at least some of you from ending up the same.” Georgia’s family did not wish to make a comment when a reporter visited their home in Havant, Hants. The family of Tommy, who goes by Tommy Bakeer and Cowan and is also from Havant, also did not wish to speak.

So far the post has been shared more than 13,000 times, and many people have paid tribute to Georgia. Katy Murray wrote: Just devastating, poor poor family. Such a tragedy heart goes out to them.  Caroline Hayman said: Thinking of family and friends, sad loss. Megan Way wrote: Thoughts go out to family and friends. So sad. And Adele Jenner said: Thinking of the family today and sending all my love and strength, so tragic. There were also claims revellers were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A statement released by organisers of Mutiny said: It is with tremendous sadness that we can confirm that two of our festival family died in hospital overnight. An 18-year-old woman and a 20 year old man were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital where they sadly died. Following the terrible news from earlier today, the team behind Mutiny Festival are incredibly sad to announce that the Sunday of the festival has been cancelled as a safety precaution. The safety of our amazing customers has always been paramount to us and so to keep everyone safe and in respect to those who have passed, we have taken the decision not to open today. As you can imagine, this decision was not taken lightly and was taken with the support of the local statutory authorities who we continue to work with.

Temperatures are set to soar to 29C on Bank Holiday Monday after some parts of the country were hit by rain, hail and thunderstorms. However, The Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning for parts of the south, as forecasters warned there is a small chance of homes and businesses flooding quickly. Yesterday Birmingham saw traffic chaos thanks to flash flooding and a major route into the city was left impassable because of water up to 5ft deep.  Today most of the country is likely to see spells of warm sunshine, but these will trigger afternoon showers and isolated thunderstorms in the south and west, according to the Met Office. A huge electrical storm swept the Midlands overnight with flashes of lightning and huge rumbles of thunder. The storm, which began just after 11pm in some parts and raged on through the night, followed a day of muggy 27C temperatures.  The Met Office is warning the thunderstorms in Birmingham could cause a danger to life. It is in place until 6am Monday. The Met Office say: Fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life, forecasters add. The Met Office said a site at Winterbourne, in Edgbaston, recorded 58mm of rainfall in just one hour on Sunday afternoon, and 81mm in a 12-hour period. The monthly average for the West Midlands region in May is 55mm, meteorologist Craig Snell said.  But he said the torrential rain had been very localised, pointing out that another site 10 miles away at Coleshill recorded just 3mm of rain in 12 hours. Mr Snell said: We won\u0027t see the scenes we saw last night.  There could be a few very short-lived thunderstorms but overall it will be a much quieter night. Southern England was struck by lightning between 15,000 and 20,000 times on Saturday night into Sunday morning. The Environment Agency has more than 20 flood warnings and more than 40 flood alerts in place covering much of Central England.

The retailer has found itself in the bottom two for its eighth consecutive year after shoppers panned it for poor customer service and value as well as for the standard of its shops  I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating, one customer told Which?, while another said: I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.  A third shopper summed up the retailer\u0027s troubles, branding it hugely inferior to what it was in the past. WH Smith\u0027s poor performance comes only a week after it faced a backlash for overcharging customers for toothpaste and other toiletries in its hospital shops. Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.  The customer scores given are based on customers\u0027 experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop. Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn\u0027t even manage last year\u0027s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the friendly and cheerful staff at Smyths Toys. Last year\u0027s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds - a winner at last week\u0027s Which? Awards - are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively. Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since our annual survey launched in 2010.  But the department store\u0027s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty. Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings. Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money. Customers also favoured retailers that offered a sensory experience or specific expertise that is simply not available to them online. Getting top marks in this year\u0027s entertainment category was Waterstones, despite the rise of e-books and the popularity of online retailers like Amazon. People who gave it a high score commented on the stores\u0027 pleasant surroundings as well as the recommendations from friendly staff.

The report, published by Las Vegas news station KLAS, reveals new details of the November 2004 encounter including first hand reports from shocked US Navy personnel.  A video of the strange object, shaped like a Tic Tac mint, emerged last December.  And the report reveals further details of how the UFO was repeatedly spotted during training exercises over a six-day period off the coast of southern California and Mexico.  It was initially seen on radar by the crew of the USS Princeton on November 10, who referred to it in the report as an Anomalous Aerial Vehicle (AAV).  The missile cruiser\u0027s chief fire controlman said it started at an altitude of around 60,000ft - the furthest the ship\u0027s radar could detect - before very rapidly dropping to 50ft. The object then darted away at such speed it was assumed to be a ballistic missile.  It was seen again on November 14, and several F/A-18 Hornet jets returning to the USS Nimitz were sent to try and trace the object. But they were unable to detect the UFO itself, with one of the pilots instead reporting a circular disturbance in the water between 50 and 100 metres in diameter. A Hawkeye surveillance aircraft was also unable to get a lock on to the UFO.  According to the report, it was possible the disturbance was being caused by an AAV but the AAV was \u0027cloaked\u0027 or invisible to the human eye. Another theory was the object had a highly advanced capability to operate undersea completely undetectable by our most advanced sensors. The object was later described by witnesses as an elongated or a \u0027Tic Tac\u0027 shape and said it was around 46ft long, solid white, smooth, with no edges.  It was uniformly coloured with no nacelles, pylons or wings, the report claimed.  F/A-18 pilot David Fravor later revealed the object appeared to notice the US aircraft before zooming away.  He said: It takes off like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. One minute it\u0027s here, and off, it\u0027s gone.

Holidaymakers filmed the prostitution protest, which was organised by a group of mainly British businesses, on their phones.

The protest took place in Magaluf in the early hours of the morning and was approved by police. However, tourists visiting the Spanish island of Majorca joined in.   The organisers say the prostitutes stir up trouble, often stealing credit card details and valuables from drunk holidaymakers. In one incident in Magaluf, a group of prostitutes used tasers to stun their victims. One German tourist had a €4,000 (\u0026pound3,500) gold chain ripped from his neck.

The man, likened to web-slinging superhero Spiderman after the incident, sprang into action after the four-year-old boy was seen desperately clinging to a balcony in Paris on Saturday afternoon. Fire crews had already been called to the building at Rue Marx-Dormoy in the French capital\u0027s 18th arrondissement with a terrified neighbour on the neighbouring balcony struggling to help the boy back up.  And one brave man started climbing before emergency services arrived, with jaw-dropping social media footage showing him risking his life.

Mr Berres said he wants to give the villa, named Son Coll in the rural north-east town of Arta, a spruce-up. Squatters have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property. But Mr Berres, a 44-year-old carpenter, insisted this week he would leave if police turned up to tell him to go.

Becker , 50, was declared bankrupt last June after blowing his \u0026pound100m fortune.  The triple Wimbledon champion’s wife Lilly vowed to stand by him but revealed in March their marriage came close to collapsing.  The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close \u0026pound13million before withdrawing it shortly afterwards. Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they had not seen Becker for years. The pundit is thought to own Son Coll through a Spanish company.  Mr Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several “abandoned” houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had “big projects” for the 31,000-square foot property.

She was just 45 when she died but she always held everything together.“She doesn’t have a headstone – the tree is effectively that – but when I go to that space I feel the presence of my mum.“It’s not a sad feeling. I feel a lot of joy, a lot of playfulness, and excitement for life, which is not something normally associated with death.“I hope that people viewing my work might take a sense of celebration and peace from it.”Janine’s project features line illustrations of plants surrounding the tree at Loch Katrine where her mother’s ashes were scattered.The interactive plates are illuminated in hues of blue and turquoise when activated, colours inspired from her research in cyanotype, and is a process that she hopes can form a connection between visitors to the show and the positivity that can be discovered after loss.The exhibit is accompanied by sound recordings taken at locations important to Janine, including Loch Katrine, Tentsmuir Forest, and the University’s own Botanic Gardens.Her showcase at the Degree Show is the culmination of a 13-year journey, one which celebrates the light that can be found in the darkest of moments and the abundance of life often left in the wake of loss.The Degree Show is one of the highlights of Dundee’s cultural calendar, and has already attracted thousands of visitors since opening to the public last week.Concluding on Sunday 27 May, entry to the event is free with further details available online.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b052a5cabe27-e1527066476433.jpg ","title":"dundee people little oak becomes the latest branch of dundee family tree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA miracle baby, a surprise engagement and a beautiful christening.

Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked. I didn’t expect it at all.“If I had known I would have battered him.“It was amazing that our families were there to see it because family is so important.“There are now five generations in my family so it was really special.“My mum kindly looked after Oak that night so we were able to go out in the Ferry and celebrate.”The couple are now busy planning their wedding in 2020, which they hope can be on the same date as their engagement.“I can’t wait for the wedding,” said Kayleigh. “Oak will be two when it comes around so she will be our flower girl and she will be able to walk down the aisle.”The happy family would like to thank Kayleigh’s mum Gillian for organising and paying for the christening and also uncle Paul who took all the pictures of the day.Kayleigh added: “We would also like to say a massive thank you to all of the godparents.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).
