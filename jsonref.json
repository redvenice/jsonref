Thanks so much for joining me today and for all the comments. I’ll be back again tomorrow.Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said a number of popular holiday destinations “really deserve” to be moved to the low-risk tier. Holidaymakers returning to the UK from green locations are not required to self-isolate, and only need to take one post-arrival coronavirus test. Charles told the PA news agency he expects additions to the list to include the Greek islands of Zante, Rhodes and Kos, the Caribbean islands of Grenada and Antigua, plus Malta and Finland.The transition of those locations to green status would be “a boost” to the struggling travel industry, he said. Assessments are based on a range of factors, including the proportion of a population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new variants, and access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing. Portugal is the only viable major tourist destination currently on the green list. Charles said he would be “surprised” if Spain’s Balearic Islands – including Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca – are added in Thursday’s update.“They’re hugely popular and I’m not sure the government is ready to encourage so much travel at the moment.” He also warned that Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia could be added to the red list, which means people returning to the UK are required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel. Travellers returning to the UK from an amber list location – which includes popular hotspots such as Spain, France, Italy and Greece – must quarantine at home for 10 days and take two post-arrival tests.The Government has urged people against non-essential travel to amber countries. Boris Johnson said the Government will “wait and see” what the recommendations of the Joint Biosecurity Centre are before announcing changes to the travel lists. Despite calls from some scientists for the government to push back the planned final stage of unlocking on 21 June, the prime minister suggested he saw no reason yet to deviate from the roadmap. He did, however, urge people to remain “so cautious” because the infection rate was rising again. He said ministers had known that the number of cases would start to increase again after significant freedoms were restored on 17 May, allowing people to gather in groups of six or two households indoors and up to 30 outdoors. Speaking during a visit to a school on Wednesday – his first public appearance since marrying Carrie Johnson over the weekend – Johnson said scientists needed “a little bit longer” to figure out just how much protection the vaccines were providing against a new surge. Read the full story here: The government also said that, as of 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 4,330 lab-confirmed cases in the UK. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 153,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, PA news reports.Although teachers were told to use their professional judgment to assess the grades their pupils should receive, Scotland’s exam board, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), has asked for evidence to support these estimates and issued question papers that must be answered “under closed-book conditions” – while insisting that these do not amount to exams. Shirley-Anne Somerville, who is now in post as Scottish education secretary, said she took “very seriously” the anxiety and concern raised by young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was “the fairest possible”. Critics in the sector reacted angrily, in particular because there seems to be no consideration given to inidual circumstances, in particular after last year’s model was found to actively discriminate against poorer children, resulting in a government u-turn over grading. Scottish Labour said that her statement failed to answer the key questions on pupil support, new evidence and, crucially, any avenue to have personal circumstances taken into account.  Read our previous story on this here: Ross Peltier, 29, plays for the Doncaster Dons and has represented the Jamaica international team nine times. Peltier, who lives in the constituency in what he describes as a “humble terrace house”, said he had a “profile of sorts in an area which holds rugby league as its beating heart”. “I feel I can bridge the gap with the working person who has been a single party voter all his life to the Green party,” he added. Batley and Spen is currently held by Labour, who have selected Kim Leadbeater, the sister of the area’s former MP Jo Cox.  George Galloway, former MP for Bradford West and Bethnal Green and Bow, announced last week that he intends to stand with the Workers Party of Britain, stating his aim was to oust Keir Starmer as Labour leader. The Conservatives have selected Leeds councillor Ryan Stephenson as their candidate, the Yorkshire party has chosen local engineer Corey Robinson and the Lib Dems, who came fourth at the last election, have selected TV producer Jo Conchie.

The press was not allowed into the meeting, but the White House will likely soon release a readout of the discussion between the president and Capito, who is leading the Republican negotiating team. Rural northern California is seeing a troubling rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, an alarming trend that comes as residents and businesses continue to protest against safety measures and vaccinations – with one Mendocino cafe threatening to charge customers $5 for wearing a mask. While the region makes up a small proportion of the state’s population, the growth in its caseload has been considerable, and comes at a time when the state overall is enjoying some of the lowest rates of Covid in the country.  After largely avoiding the worst of the pandemic, a block of far northern California counties now leads the state with nearly 40 cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, according to statistics maintained by the Los Angeles Times. Tehama county ranked the highest in the LA Times case ratings with 139 cases per 100,000 residents. Meanwhile 10 of the 21 total Covid deaths in nearby Siskiyou county have occurred since the beginning of May. The region has long been one of the most forceful in its pushback against measures such as masks, business restrictions and vaccine mandates – and the protests have only continued to gain steam. A cafe in the town of Mendocino made headlines after announcing it will charge customers a $5 fee if they order while wearing a mask. It also threatened to charge $5 to anyone “caught bragging about your vaccine”. The blog was clearly meant to help Trump amplify his political message after he was suspended from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the January 6 insurrection. However, the page did not have the kind of interactive features available on all major social media platforms, so users were unable to directly respond to Trump’s statements. That unsuccessful dynamic seems to have led to the blog’s early demise.The president and the senator are expected to discuss the latest infrastructure offer from Capito and her group of fellow Republicans, who have been negotiating with the White House in recent weeks. Republicans have proposed spending $928 billion on infrastructure over the next eight years. However, only $257 billion in that proposal is considered new funds the rest is baseline spending, meaning money that was already going to be used on infrastructure projects because of existing policies. In contrast, Biden has proposed spending $1.7 trillion over baseline spending levels on infrastructure. So the two sides remain far apart in their negotiations, and this meeting will likely determine whether any bipartisan deal can be reached.The G7 meeting begins in the UK mid-month. Here are the other main events of the day so far: Among other initiatives, four of the largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. The president emphasized that the vaccines will allow Americans to enjoy a summer where they can safely gather with loved ones without fear of the virus. “America is heading into a summer dramatically different from last year’s summer,” Biden said. “A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of get-togethers and celebrations. An all-American summer that this country deserves after a long, long dark winter that we have all endured.” Biden also noted that Americans are lucky to have such easy access to the vaccines, saying, “All over the world, people are desperate to get a shot that every American can get at their neighborhood drugstore.” The president also specifically urged younger Americans to get their vaccines, as their vaccination rates have lagged behind those of older Americans. “We need people under 40 to step up,” Biden said.The Biden administration announced this morning that it is launching a “month of action” to encourage Americans to get vaccinated.  Among other initiatives, the month of action includes a nationwide tour by Kamala Harris and a partnership with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to spread information about vaccines. “It’s clearer than ever — the more people we get vaccinated, the more success we’re going to have in our fight against this virus,” Biden said.The White House press secretary’s briefing has now ended, and Biden will soon deliver an update on the country’s vaccine distribution efforts. His administration has already announced a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated before July 4.“She actually asked to run point and lead on voting rights,” the White House press secretary said. Joe Biden announced yesterday that Harris would take the lead on voting rights initiatives as congressional Democrats work to advance the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. “I’m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities,” Biden said in Tulsa. “With her leadership and your support, we’re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it’s going to take a hell of a lot of work.” The announcement came as Republican legislators in dozens of states advance bills that would restrict voting access, as the ’s Sam Levine has extensively reported on. Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the massacre in Tulsa, the president touched on the hurdles in advancing his legislative agenda because of Democrats’ narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress. “I hear all the folks on TV saying, ‘Why doesn’t Biden get this done?’” the president told the Tulsa crowd. “Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.” The White House press secretary claimed that Biden’s comment was only meant to reflect the difficulty of discussing complex policy negotiations in a television format. “I don’t think he was intending to convey anything other than a little bit of commentary on TV punditry,” Psaki said.The incident came weeks after another ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline disrupted gasoline supply in several east-coast states. The White House previously said the hackers were most likely a criminal group based in Russia, and Psaki said Joe Biden will discuss recent cyber attacks when he meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in two weeks. “President Biden certainly thinks Putin and the Russian government have a role to play in stopping these attacks,” Psaki said. Psaki opened the briefing by reiterating the administration’s announcement that it is launching a “month of action” to get more Americans vaccinated by July 4. The White House announced that four of largest US childcare providers will offer free childcare for caregivers who are getting the vaccine or recovering after their shot. Pharmacy chains across the country, including Albertsons, CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens, will also offer extended hours from now until July 4 to make it easier to get vaccinated. Vice-President Kamala Harris is launching a “nation-wide tour to reach millions of Americans who still need protection against the virus”. “The Vice President’s travel will be anchored in the South, and the First Lady, the Second Gentleman, and members of the Cabinet will also join the Administration’s tour to communities across the country,” the White House said in its factsheet about the new initiatives. The administration is also partnering with Black-owned barbershops and beauty salons to start “Shots at the Shop,” which will allow the businesses to share vaccine information with their customers. “The ‘Shots at the Shop’ initiative will invite participation from across the country, with a particular focus on supporting shops in some of the hardest-hit localities still experiencing significant gaps in vaccination rates,” the White House said. Joe Biden will likely tout all these new developments when he delivers an update on vaccine distribution efforts this afternoon.Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s top election official who became one of the leading voices beating back conspiracies about the 2020 election, announced Wednesday she was seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in her state.  Arizona, where Donald Trump narrowly lost to Joe Biden in November, has become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who falsely believe the election was stolen. After the election, Hobbs beat back baseless claims of fraud and ensured that the state’s presidential electors were certified for Biden to properly reflect the outcome of the popular vote. “We had a job to do, and that job was simple: Count every vote. When you’re under attack, some would have you believe you have two choices: To fight or give in. But there’s a third option: Get the job done,” Hobbs said. “The other side isn’t offering policies to make our lives better. They’re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse.” In recent months, Hobbs, elected to her office in 2018, has taken on a leading role in monitoring and calling out a GOP-led review of 2.1m ballots cast in Maricopa county, the most populous in Arizona.  She has drawn attention to shoddy practices auditors are using and monitors deployed by her office have regularly noted significant problems in procedures. A compilation of notes published by Hobbs’ office on Tuesday, for example, detail security lapses, technological glitches, and confusion about who is in charge. The details revealed by her office have underscore how unprofessional the audit is. Hobbs’ entrance in the governor’s race will likely bring even more attention to who her successor will be. Mark Finchem, an Arizona legislator who is a prominent advocate of the Stop the Steal movement, is already seeking the Republican nomination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dac11407e002364d30778f28705ef1957da59d81/0_380_4707_2825/master/4707.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4cf746600f4720b6d557e7ad46127259","title":"coronavirus live news who sinovac vaccine approved malaysia lockdown","story":"If permission to purchase vaccines is not granted, it said it would call a strike.  “Next Friday the 11th, if there are no answers to our request, we are going to withdraw from our jobs to protect the health of all our colleagues,” the union’s leader, Guillermo Pereyra, said.France, which began vaccinations late last year with priority given to care home residents, has gradually been widening eligibility by lowering age thresholds and removing conditions such as profession or state of health. From May 31, Covid-19 vaccines were made available to everyone over 18. President Emmanuel Macron told reporters earlier on Wednesday that from June 15, young people aged 12 to 18 will be allowed to get a Covid-19 vaccine from June 15.It brings the total to 2,423,928 infections and 228,146 deaths, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday. Regions with a 14-day notification rate of infections below 50 cases per 100,000 people will be able to open discos and clubs until 3 am, although some restrictions will continue, Reuters reports. It was not clear whether dance floors will be allowed and the party group - a maximum of six people inside - has to remain masked, according to local media. “A gradual and progressive return to normality is needed. Lessons must be learned”, the health minister, Carolina Darias, told journalists. Health standards are in the hands of the regions in Spain, although according to the minister, this agreement is binding. Madrid, where bars and restaurants are already open until 1am despite being one of the top five regions with the highest infection rates, rejects the criteria and wants more flexibility. Spain’s overall infection rate fell to 118.5 cases per 100,000 on Wednesday, nearly halving since the end of April, but only the Balearic islands, Valencia and the North African enclave of Ceuta meet the sub-50 requirement. Those figures are up from the 296,404,240 vaccine doses the CDC said had been administered by 1 June out of 366,317,045 doses delivered, Reuters reports."},{"url":null,"title":"leaving cert students must wait until september 3rd to get results","story":"Leaving Cert students will have to wait until early September before receiving their results and CAO offers. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienLeaving Cert students will have to wait until early September before receiving their results and CAO offers.Minister for Education Norma Foley has confirmed that students will be able to access their results online on Friday, September 3rd, about three weeks later than normal.It is likely that CAO round one offers for college applicants will follow shortly afterwards in the week beginning Monday, September 6th.The later results date this year will force many third-level colleges to delay the admission of first-year students by a least a fortnight.Higher education sources say colleges will reopen as scheduled for other students .Ucas, which oversees applications to UK colleges, said it will move its deadline for accepting offers from Irish students until September 7th to accommodate the new results date.OptionsLeaving Cert students this year have the option to avail of accredited grades based on teachers’ estimates, sitting the written exams, or both, in any subject.Students will be automatically credited with the higher of the two grades in their final results.The vast majority of this year’s 60,000 Leaving Cert students have chosen to avail of accredited grades and sit at least one written exam. Some 99 per cent have opted for accredited grades, while 91 per cent plan to sit an exam.The written exams begin on Wednesday, June 9th and and will run until the end of the month.Ms Foley confirmed students will receive their results directly on thecandidate self-service portal, where they registered their options for exams or accredited grades, or both.“The usual helplines and supports will be in place for students on results day and beyond. I will be in contact with schools asking them to ensure that guidance support is available to students at this time,” she said.“I would like to take this opportunity once again to stress how important it is that students taking the examinations continue to follow the public health advice and limit their contacts as the examinations approach and during the examination period.”Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire criticised the delay in providing students with their results.“ This is crucial time lost, where students could have time to make an informed decision on whether they want to accept their third level offer,” he said.Labour education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin called on Ms Foley to move the date back to mid-August.“This will create more anxiety for students who have already endured a roller-coaster year,” he said.“The written exams are taking place at the usual time, and the accredited grades system is already in place, so I am at a loss as to why the results date will be in September.DelaysA number of higher education institutions are planning to delay the planned enrolment of first-year students in light of the later Leaving Cert results date.The academic year gets under way on September 6th in NUI Galway and University of Limerick, and on September 13th in Trinity College Dublin, UCD, UCC and TU Dublin, among others.Higher education sources say it is likely that enrolment will delayed until September 20th or later in many of these institutions.They say additional time will be needed for students to develop a new schedule for CAO offers.DCU, which was due to begin an orientation week for first years on September 13th and teaching on September 20th, said it is also working on a new schedule for new students.It said campus accommodation move-in dates will reflect any changes to enrolment for first years.Maynooth University – which had been planning to enrol first years from September 20th – is likely to be unaffected by the new results date.A spokeswoman for Ucas, meanwhile, said it has moved its “advisory conditions deadline” to September 7th in order to give students more time to meet their offers.“Any student that has a question about their specific application should contact their chosen university,” she said.Eunicas, which organises admissions to many European universities, said it was working with them to ensure Irish students can start their programmes as normal.Guy Flouch, head of Eunicas, said it was likely that Dutch universities will be able to accept late results. However, he said confirmation was not yet available from the Dutch ministry of education.CautionPublic health experts, meanwhile, have cautioned students and their families that they have entered a crucial phase where the threat of Covid-19 could disrupt candidates’ plans to sit exams.Any student who is a close contact of a positive case is required to restrict their movements for at least 10 days.Separately, education analysts expect that students’ grades and CAO points will be higher this year when the results are released in early September.This is on the basis that teachers’ estimated grades last year were significantly higher than historical results in the written exams.Some analysts believe grade inflation could rise even higher this year due to the fact that students will have more choice and time in their written exams, and will automatically be credited with their best result.Grade inflationLast year, grade inflation resulted in CAO points rising to a new high, while this year a record 84,000 students have applied for college places in the coming academic year.This is due to demographic factors as well as additional mature students seeking to retrain and increased interest from overseas applicants sparked by Brexit.Government sources say they hope the addition of about 4,000 extra third-level places this year will absorb pressure linked to growing demand and grade inflation.Details of where the additional places will go are still being worked out, but senior sources want to target them in areas of demand such as health, law, business, science, the environment and journalism."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Coveney says the countries share a commitment to global action on justice, conflict prevention and multilateralismInvestment in Cork commuter rail among items to receive funding under recovery planRevisiting strategies to align with climate action can ensure long-term viability and attract new investors"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca dose gap can reduce from 12 to eight weeks under new advice","story":"May 30th, 2021: Eyewitness footage has captured large crowds gathering in Dublin city centre on the evening of Saturday, May 30th.

However, the HSE’s decision will be contingent on there being enough supplies of the vaccine to make this change.The gaps between AstraZeneca doses was originally 16 weeks but was later reduced to 12 weeks.UK studies have shown that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are only 33 per cent effective in protecting against infection by the delta variant first identified in India, but that effectiveness rises to over 80 per cent after two doses.Earlier, Dr Holohan doubled down on his criticism of large crowds socialising in Dublin city centre last weekend.The scenes of crowds mixing on South William Street “looked like Jones’s Road on the day of an All-Ireland”, he said.While it could have been anticipated that people would be tempted to come out by the good weather, “if the council had organised an outdoor event they couldn’t have squeezed more people in there”.Not every outdoors activity is safe, he stressed. “If you get a large crowd in a small area, in close physical contact, that will present opportunities for transmission.”Meanwhile, people who have had Covid-19 are now presumed to have immunity for nine months, according to Dr Holohan.This period may be further increased from the previous six-month period to 12 months later this year, he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will also look at whether vaccinated people have to wear masks as part of a continuing review over the summer.A further 407 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by Nphet on Wednesday.With 5,811 cases reported over the past fortnight, the 14-day incidence now stands at 122 cases per 100,000 people.Some 81 per cent of cases were among people aged under 45 years, with just 2 per cent in those aged 65 and over.The median age of cases is 24 years.Incidence is highest in Limerick, at 376 cases per 100,000 people. The next highest incidence is in Donegal, followed by Offaly and Dublin.There are currently 93 Covid-19 patients in hospital including 34 in ICU.The reproduction number, a measure of how many other people a case infects, now stands at “just below 1,” according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group. Prof Nolan said the situation was stable and the outlook is positive thanks to the effect of vaccination. An average of 11,500 tests a day are being carried out, yielding a positivity rate of 3.7 per cent.However, unvaccinated people in particular needed to be careful and people generally need to keep their close contacts low over the coming weeks.Limerick recorded 740 cases in the second half of May, driven by multiple community outbreaks linked to “high risk” indoor activity such as house parties and family events, according to Dr Mai Mannix, public health doctor with the HSE in the mid-west.The vast majority of cases involved people in their 30s and 40s.In one instance, 30 cases were recorded in a school after a series of birthday parties and social events involving students. This activity around education led to a “combined pressure cooker effect” in the school, she said.In a second example, at least 40 cases resulted from a household outbreak which affected all family members. One member attended a social gathering, resulting in four more cases.Dr Mannix said a family member worked in a place “with strong ties to a particular community” where people tended to gather. From here, the virus spread to three households, another workplace, further households and two education settings.Dr Mannix said Limerick has recorded more than 50 cases in 20 workplaces during this period, including retailers, beauticians, hair salons, offices and factories. One hair salon had more than 50 contacts.In some workplaces the wearing of masks appeared to be “intermittent”, she said.Dr Nolan pointed out that about 70 per cent of the population remains at risk of infection from the virus, but vaccination was cutting this by 5 per cent a week. Arguing against a faster easing of restrictions, he said Nphet was following a “carefully calibrated” process of keeping variants out while people were being vaccinated. The number of cases of the delta variant first identified in India sequenced in the Republic has increased from 97 last week to 115, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory.Dr de Gascun said the data was reassuring but vigilance was still required to ensure no superspreader event occurred.Three cases of the variant have been identified in mandatory hotel quarantine in the past 10 days, officials said. Most Irish cases have been found in and around Dublin, while a cluster of the related kappa variant has been identified in the south-west.The delta variant remains “a cloud on the horizon,” according to Dr Holohan.Northern Ireland recorded no further deaths with Covid-19 on Wednesday, according to the North’s Department of Health. An additional 84 people tested positive for the virus. A total of 17 patients are receiving hospital treatment for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, with two in intensive care. Meanwhile, people aged 40 to 44 years old in the Republic will be able to register for vaccination from Wednesday.Those in that age group can register online for vaccination at vaccine.hse.ie or by phone at 1850 241850 for appointments. Once successfully registered, the HSE will send the appointment details by text message. People who register will be referred to a HSE vaccination centre and will be vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said that more than half the adult population had received their first dose of the vaccine with more than 2.7 million injections administered.“We’re moving ever closer to meeting our goal of offering vaccinations to everyone in Ireland who wants one,” he said.Mr Donnelly said there had been “very encouraging advances technologically” making the Pfizer vaccine much easier to store than the “super-low temperatures” used up to now.“All of this is going to serve as a backbone for our vaccination strategy for the next two years,” the Minister added.“We’re also taking steps to plan access to vaccines for countries less fortunate than ours.”He said that just 2 per cent of cases are now in those over 65 and nearly 80 per cent of cases are those aged 45 or younger.The reduction of cases for healthcare workers and those in long-term residential care was of the order of 97 per cent or 98 per cent, he added.Pharmacists will also become involved in the Covid-19 vaccination programme from early June.Following a long campaign to include pharmacists in the administration of Covid-19 injections, Mr Donnelly said the HSE confirmed on Monday afternoon that they would now have a role.They would be “particularly important” in “some of the areas which are further from the vaccination centres”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

File photograph: Dara MacDónaill  The Third level institutions will find it difficult to cater to the demand from Erasmus students who are opting to study in Ireland instead of the UK due to Brexit, the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU has heard.Representatives from various third level bodies said Irish colleges and universities will struggle to capitalise on the increased numbers of EU and non-EU students choosing to come to Ireland in the wake of Brexit, due to years of chronic under-investment.Concerns were also raised that Erasmus exchanges, traineeships and work placements, facilitated between Irish and UK colleges, would be withdrawn after the academic year 202223, when the UK formally leaves the Erasmus programme.Students from the Republic who attend colleges in the North, and vice versa, also need clarity regarding their status as international students, the committee heard.Jim Miley, director general of the Irish Universities Association (IUA), said that a substantial number of students who would previously have chosen the UK for their degree programme or for an Erasmus exchange are now likely to opt for Ireland due to Brexit.“More than 120,000 non-UK EU students studied in the UK annually before Brexit. While these students paid high tuition fees, they had access to government grantloan funding to assist with the costs, paid back on graduation. “Access to this funding is no longer available and students who do not have the ability to cover the higher non-EU tuition fees will seek alternative destinations. “The 2021 application deadline to UCAS showed that the number of EU applicants stood at 26,010, down from 43,030 the previous year, a drop of 40 per cent. Ireland should aim to be the preferred alternative destination for these students.”However, the Irish higher education sector will need serious investment to cater to these students, said Mr Miley. The ratio of staff to students in Ireland’s third level institutions is quite low, and facility upgrades are needed. “Capacity constraints could limit Ireland’s ability to absorb this demand,” he warned.He added that the UK was now specifically marketing itself to non-EU international students, so Ireland may not have much of an advantage as previously thought, as the only English-speaking country in the EU. “Rankings are far more potent factors in attracting international students. The lack of adequate investment in the university sector over the last decade means that Ireland has lost ground in rankings and is not in a position to compete as effectively in the highly competitive international student market.”With regards to research activities, which mainly concerns Masters students, PhDs and staff, Nora Trench Bowles of the IUA said Ireland’s Government Budget Allocation for Research and Development (GBARD) has been consistently below 1 per cent of total expenditure since 2012, reaching an all-time low of 0.93 per cent in 2018. “This is well below the EU average for GBARD, which is 1.34 per cent of total government expenditure. Ireland’s is almost half that of key competitor countries such as Denmark, ” she said. An additional €350 million per year would be needed to bring Ireland into line with the EU average.She said other issues, such as housing, the cost of childcare, and the lack of work opportunities for researcher’s families were also hindering Ireland’s research potential.The sector’s ability to purchase lab supplies and building materials is also being affected by Brexit, with Mr Miley warning that building costs of current projects are already costing more than planned.

File Image: The  Local authorities should have powers to vary local property tax (LPT) rates by significantly more than the 15 per cent limit that currently exists, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told Fine Gael colleagues on Wednesday night.Up until now, councils in Dublin in particular have used the 15 per cent freedom to reduce LPT rates in their areas, though this has led to complaints about the impact of local services.Fine Gael’s 2020 election manifesto already pledges to offer councillors more discretion to change LPT rates beyond the current ability they have to raise or decrease the rate.It is understood that Mr Varadkar’s preference could be included in the legislation that could pass the Oireachtas before the summer, though this would be subject to Coalition agreement.Meanwhile, people who buy new-build homes will not escape the LPT net like those who did so from 2013 until the reforms announced on Wednesday by the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe. New homes bought between 2022 and November 2025 will pay LPT calculated on a retrospective valuation of what it would have been worth if it had existed in November 2021.One hundred thousand homes built over the last eight years are now finally becoming liable for the tax, though the majority of homes that have already paid the tax will not face higher bills.Properties will be revalued in November to update the existing 2013 records of what the homes were valued at, while valuations will be updated every four years from now on, Mr Donohoe said.The rate of the tax has been cut and the property value bands widened “to make the changes affordable”, he said, adding that the majority of homeowners would see a decrease or no change in their bills.The changes, which will see the homes affected by an increase paying on average €90 more annually, will increase the annual yield raised by the LPT rise from €480 million to about €560 million.Homeowners will continue to self-declare their home’s value as of November 1st, 2021, though Mr Donohoe said the majority currently make an honest judgment.Inaccurate self-declarationsThe Revenue Commissioners will continue to follow up and challenge inaccurate declarations: “There are risks with any tax that is self-declared,” he told journalists. From 2023-2024 onwards, local authorities will retain 100 per cent of the LPT collected in their areas, in a bid to deal with Dublin complaints that revenue collected there is spent elsewhere.Currently, 80 per cent of the revenue raised is retained in each council’s area, but the remaining 20 per cent is placed in a central government fund and dispersed elsewhere.No local authority will be worse off from the change, said the Minister, adding that the exchequer would make up the €40 million to €60 million shortfall that this would cause.The new regime will see exemptions for pyrite-damaged homes phased out, with Mr Donohoe saying that “significant sums” of up to €166 million have been spent on repairs since 2014.Temporary exemptions will remain for the owners of pyrite- and mica-damaged homes in Donegal and Mayo that are eligible for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Meanwhile, the Minister is seeking to accelerate the passage of the legislation before the Oireachtas’s summer recess by bypassing the pre-legislative scrutiny due on legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"fianna f%C3%A1il candidate s old blog criticises tenant for cooking dinner in kitchen","story":"Deirdre Conroy’s old blog was titled Diary of a Dublin Landlady. File photograph: Eric Luke Past comments made by Fianna Fáil’s Dublin Bay South byelection candidate about a previous tenant lodging in her home, criticising them for cooking dinner in the kitchen, have been described as “shocking”. Brigid Purcell, People Before Profit candidate in the upcoming byelection, said the comments were “completely inappropriate” and showed “a lack of respect for renters.An old online blog from Deirdre Conroy byelection candidate criticised a tenant l for cooking dinner in the kitchen, which she wrote she would be “banning” next time. In the blog, titled Diary of a Dublin Landlady, she took aim at a former Latvian tenant over his “rancid” smelling cooking. She also criticised the tenant for claiming child benefit for a child back in his home country. In a February 2013 blog post, the former travel journalist described a “handsome prospect” from Latvia turning up for a viewing, who she said was a “lookalike” of Dr Kovac, a character from the US television drama ER. In her old blog, she first took issue with the Latvian tenant, after he asked for the heating to be put on during the night.The “last straw” for the tenant came only a few days later, with him “taking over the kitchen for two hours on Sunday evening,” she wrote. The kitchen layout meant the “foul-smelling cooking” filled the house with “fetid fumes for hours,” she wrote. “I’ll soon be back looking for a co-habitable tenant, a busy travelling man or woman who doesn’t like to cook. And just needs a base where I’ll happily wash and dry their clothes,” she wrote. A March 4th, 2013 post struck a more upbeat tone, on the day the tenant was due to move out. “This is the last morning I will awake to the rancid smell of boiled rice and oats,” Ms Conroy wrote. “I had it on good advice that single men like to eat out and when they’re not eating out they’re at the gym or having pints with their mates. That would be Irish single men, not Latvians,” she said. Ms Conroy wrote she was “exhausted” from leaving the house to escape the tenant’s “prolonged boiling” in the kitchen, and would be “banning” the next tenant from cooking. She also criticised the tenant for claiming child benefit for a child back in Latvia, to send the money home. “Worst of all, none of the money will be spent on Irish milk, bread, school uniforms, shoes, or even a night out with the missus,” she wrote. In a statement, Ms Conroy said the blog was written “in a light hearted manner,” and as a former landlord she had “good experiences and some bad ones.” “I was not in any way trying to suggest that people from Latvia were bad tenants. I had one bad experience with a tenant who happened to be from Latvia,” she said. She had rented the room in her home during the financial recession, but no longer did so, she said. “Anyone who knows me will know that I am a very inclusive person who is committed to ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their background, is treated equally,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"mcgrath backed health job pay rise if it did not exceed 300 000 committee told","story":" Robert Watt, secretary general of the Department of Health, has waived the €80,000 pay increase for the moment in the light of current economic circumstances.

The Department of Health has declined to answer questions on the economic criteria to apply for the full substantive salary tobe paid.Mr Fraser told the hearing on Wednesday that this would be at the discretion of Mr Watt.Questioned by the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin on whether there had been any decsion to carry out a benchmarking exercise on the pay that should apply for the Department of Health post, Mr Fraser said :“I certainly didn’t.”Mr Stanley said the secretary general of Department of Health in Scotland had a salary of €173,000 while in Finland the pay for a similar post was €131,000. He said the director of the World Health Organisation was paid €191,000.Mr Fraser said he did not know these figures.Mr Stanley said his parliamentary assistant had found out these international salary comparisons in an hour.Mr Fraser told Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin said he would rather “there was a much more scientific basis for all of these things but there isn’t there isn’t a public service pay body”.Asked by Mr McGuinness where the €80,000 figure for the pay rise had come from, Mr Fraser said the Minister agreed there should be an increased remuneration package “but felt it should be less than €300,000 and the figure of €292,000 was arrived at”."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland faces turbulent few months over brexit says varadkar","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar: ‘I have to emphasise that the only sustainable solutions are joint solutions, not unilateral action that would bring us nowhere.’ Photograph Nick Bradshaw Northern Ireland faces a “turbulent few months” as the countdown to Assembly elections has begun and with “unease” within unionism about the Brexit protocol, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking at the fifth dialogue of the Government’s Shared Island initiative, the Fine Gael leader said there was “political will in Dublin” to resolve outstanding issues around the protocol.The Government would “allow space for constructive technical engagement” to continue between the British government and the European Commission on resolving these matters.“But I have to emphasise that the only sustainable solutions are joint solutions, not unilateral action that would bring us nowhere,” Mr Varadkar said.The protocol was agreed as part of the December 2020 trade deal covering the UK’s exit from the EU, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea to avoid checks on the Irish land border.The new Democratic Unionist Party leader Edwin Poots has called for the measure to be scrapped and has urged the UK government to invoke Article 16 of the protocol to suspend it.Mr Poots has accused the EU of causing “demonstrable harm” to the peace process and said he is concerned about violence this summer due to anger over the protocol.Addressing the online Shared Island conference from Dublin Castle, Mr Varadkar said the Government would try to build political relationship with Mr Poots and the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party Doug Beattie as Northern Ireland heads towards Assembly elections in May 2022. “With the countdown elections effectively having begun, I think we are in for a turbulent few months,” he said.Mr Varadkar rejected a view expressed from the Protestant-unionist-loyalist community in Northern Ireland that its relationship with the Irish Government was “at an all-time low.” He acknowledged that to “reboot” political relationships there would be a need for an agreement on the protocol to “make that work better.” In thinly veiled remarks about the DUP, he stressed that the north-south relationship should not be characterised as a relationship between “one government and one party.”Middle groundHe described Northern Ireland as a “territory of minorities now” that is “more complicated to manage and work with”. He said there is an “exciting” middle ground of people identifying as British and Irish or Northern Irish - rather than Irish or British - and that this group was growing.“There are any number of parties, none of which represents much more than a fifth or a quarter of the population, so I think we need not make the mistake that any one party or any one community is Northern Ireland,” said Mr Varadkar.The Tánaiste accepted that there were “a lot of entrenched positions” around the protocol but that he doesn’t see any alternative solution to it.He warned that a breakdown in agreement on the protocol could also result in a breakdown in the wider free trade agreement between the EU and the UK. “That would leave Britain in a very difficult position,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the Northern Ireland protocol was agreed to manage the challenges of a hard Brexit that required checks and controls between the EU and UK to take place “somewhere.”“If they are not going to be at the ports and airports no matter how light and unobtrusive, then they have to be along nine counties and that is not something that the majority of people I believe in Northern Ireland or the Republic want,” he said. If that is accepted, then checks at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports must work better, he added. How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph:  Eva Marie UzcateguiBloombergLast September, nearly half of all US adults told the Pew Research Center that they would “probably” or “definitely” not accept a Covid-19 vaccine. More than four in 10 Democrats were among them.It is only in retrospect that the breadth of America’s initial vaccine hesitancy is startling. At the time, it was wholly of a piece with a nation lost to quackery, civic decline and near-feral scorn for elites.It is hard to know where that nation went. The US has administered at least one dose of vaccine to 63 per cent of adults, which implies millions of changed minds (and a few bluffers to begin with).President Joe Biden is aiming for 70 per cent by July 4th. Regardless of age, half the entire population is now partly vaccinated. With variants of the virus nearer at hand than herd immunity, refuseniks are still plentiful enough to matter. It is rash to dismiss their once-daunting movement as a paper tiger. But there is no ignoring the broad show of trusting compliance and its threat to all we “know” about this fractious country.It is time to entertain the exotic thought that America is not its politics. The first clue for this epiphany came last year, when a lockdown with few if any peacetime precedents commanded not just wide obedience but supermajorities of assent.Biden is president in large part because his predecessor Donald Trump bet on a silent plurality of, “Don’t tread on me” types that never materialised. What dissent there was – over the utility of masks, the wisdom of indoor rallies – was real enough and lethal enough. But the “culture war” was for the most part a headline in search of nationwide substance. Given the tribalism of red and blue America, it should have been much worse.Audit of governmentThe pandemic itself was an audit of government. Vaccination, at least in countries with sufficient doses, is a test of governability. It probes how much voters themselves accept facts, defer to remote authorities and set norms of good citizenship for each other.On that score, no rich nation was expected to fare worse than one in its third decade of vicious partisanship. Even those of us who don’t use the window into Hades that is social media feared for US take-up rates. Instead, it is Taiwan and other Pacific paragons, the cue for much credulous bunk about Asian docility this time last year, that are having to catch up.The implications here are profound. If there is a gap between the noise of America’s public square and the good sense of its mass behaviour (what economists would call its revealed preferences), the first should trouble us much less than it does. A country that can at times seem bound for violent rupture might be deceptively cohesive and governable. The lesson is as much for its external enemies as anyone else. They should not derive too much hope from the US’s discordant politics.It is hard to push this line of argument far without whitewashing politics as a harmless sideshow. It isn’t. It gets people killed on the grounds of Congress. To judge by the moral arc of the Republican party, there is no respite in the offing. But it is sometimes taken for granted that a nation’s public life dictates all its social outcomes.The evidence of the moment suggests that it need not. At least while the stakes are existential, Americans seem able to outperform their politics.‘Weekend bigot’The mystery is how. The Scots have a phrase for a Celtic or Rangers fan who howls sectarian abuse before resuming a blameless life. This is your “weekend bigot”. It is only one example of our species’ eerie knack for compartmentalisation. Lots of people who tell pollsters that Israel had a hand in the September 11th attacks in the US then go about their banal day.For all its poison, US politics appears to be highly compartmentalised. Millions of people use it as an outlet for a coarse or tribal part of themselves. But most seem perfectly able to snap out of it when normal life, and especially their practical interests, call.Their avowed cynicism did not stop multitudes caving in to two technocratic demands in a year: the first on their freedom, the second on their very persons. That a large minority of Democrats and Republicans say they would mind their child marrying someone from the other party does not gum up society in a meaningful way.Seen from this angle, even the fact that most Republicans believe the 2020 election was stolen is chilling, yes, but not proof of trouble to come. What matters is how intensely they hold that belief and what, if anything, they would do to act on it. September’s anti-vaxxers seemed to mean it at the time. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"artist accuses feminists criticised nude mary wollstonecraft","story":"Feminists objected to the naked sculpture of Mary Wollstonecraft because they are in denial that women have bodies, its creator has claimed.Maggi Hambling said she was amused and surprised by the fuss over the statue, which was commissioned as a monument to “the foremother of feminism” and unveiled on Newington Green, north London, last year.The “Everywoman” sculpture consisted of a tiny naked figure atop a large plinth. It was roundly criticised, with one objector knitting a tiny vest for it in Suffragette purple.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about the fact that many people disliked her work, Hambling replied: “A lot of people didn’t want the Eiffel Tower in Paris.”She added: “What sort of surprised me was the objection to the naked figure… part of the objections came from feminists. I don’t quite know – feminists are now denying that they have bodies. There has been nude sculpture for time immemorial.Hambling said she was quite used to producing polarising works, having weathered a similar storm in 2003 when she unveiled a giant steel scallop shell on the beach at Aldeburgh in tribute to Benjamin Britten.“I think more and more people are liking it,” she said of the Wollstonecraft figure. “I haven’t once set out to be controversial, but if the thing is controversial it does show it’s got a bit of life to it.“As people of Aldeburgh have come round to the idea of Scallop on the beach, I think people have come round to the idea of the sculpture for Mary Wollstonecraft.“And it did serve its purpose in that so many more people now have asked themselves, ‘Who the hell is Mary Wollstonecraft?’ and they’ve actually found out who she was

drivers than baby boomers because they re-read the Highway Code, a survey has suggested.New research found that the youngest drivers were four times as likely to refresh their knowledge of road rules and keep up to date with changes than motorists over the age of 55.The findings have prompted the AA to warn older drivers they should periodically brush up on the Highway Code, which has been subject to numerous additions and revisions in recent years.The driving organisation said that as well as potentially leading older drivers into dangerous manoeuvres, not keeping abreast of new rules could see motorists fall foul of police sting operations.The Government is currently proposing another overhaul of the Highway Code later this year that will see drivers given greater responsibility for protecting cyclists as well as setting out new guidance for driving on smart motorways, which don’t have a hard shoulder.The survey, conducted by the car insurance company Rooster, found that while only 26 per cent of drivers over 24 said they refreshed their knowledge of the Highway Code annually, the figure rose to more than half (52 per cent) for Generation Z drivers aged between 17 and 24.Millennial drivers, aged between 24 and 35, were slightly more diligent than baby boomers, with 28.5 per cent saying they re-read the code at least once a year.The research also found that a third of drivers aged 45 to 54 said they did not need to re-read the code as they felt the rules were largely “common sense”.Meanwhile, younger drivers also came across as more aware of the limits of their ability on the road than older motorists.Nine in 10 Generation Z drivers and 89 per cent of Millennials said they were aware that conditions such as adverse weather, busy roads as well as complex road systems and roundabouts could impair their ability behind the wheel.However, only 66 per cent of older motorists admitted that such conditions could affect their ability to drive, with 34 per cent claiming no outside conditions could negatively impact their driving.Richard Tucker, founder of Rooster Insurance, said: “It’s all too easy to become a complacent driver as we gain more miles on the clock and trips around the UK. “However, this is a dangerous trap for the more mature and experienced driver to fall into, becoming more and more unaware of potential driving dangers on the UK roads. “It’s great to see the nation’s youngest drivers on the road self-imposing measures to stay informed and remain safe while they’re driving.”Following the survey, the AA warned that the Highway Code has changed significantly in recent decades as ministers added more and more rules. A spokesperson for the AA said: “The Highway Code has got bigger and bigger over the last 20 years so what you learned years ago for your driving test now has lots more rules and regulations that drivers need to know to stay on the right side of the law.“The code is a guide to good driving and also the standard by which police officers decide whether or not you have committed an offence.The key point is that the Highway Code is a tool that the Department for Transport uses for new guidance and rules and drivers of all ages need to keep up to speed with those changes.”The AA also warned that drivers who did not keep up with new changes to the Highway Code could get caught out by the police.It pointed to rules now stating that drivers now have to give the same width as they would another car when overtaking cyclists, for which some forces run enforcement operations with undercover officers on bikes.“They get very upset when a policeman pulls them over and accuses them of not being in proper control of a vehicle.”According to the survey, only 13.3 per cent of baby boomers aged 55 to 64 refreshed their knowledge of the Highway Code annually and just nine per cent of over-65s said they did.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge

artificial lawn","story":"In the name of all that is green and pleasant, will the nation ever recover from the Royal Horticultural Society’s new scorched earth policy? This august institution is calling on British gardeners to let their sward go brown this summer – and it’s not even August. It’s all in the interest of saving water, which is ironic given that we have just endured the fourth wettest May since Noah loaded up the Ark. There’s no mention of an out-and-out hosepipe ban yet, but woe betide any householder whose urban pasture looks suspiciously bright.Me, I’m perfectly happy to be shopped to the floricultural feds because my astonishingly lush lawn is artificial. It’s from Easigrass and is exactly what it says on tin.I can feel the collective intake of breath, the disapproval and the dismay you thought better of me. To be honest, I once thought better of me too. But after many years spent seeding, reseeding, turfing and re-turfing, dousing with water and possibly illegal chemicals, I had nothing to show for it but a straggly Brazilian strip.I live in a city. My little garden is overlooked by impossibly tall London poplars that cast shade and suck up every drop of moisture, save the sweat from my toil. Surely there was a better way? I’d seen fake – sorry artificial – lawns at Chelsea that looked a sight better than the real thing. So I held my nose, did my research – and came up smelling of roses.Allow me to proselytise artificial lawns are not universally bad for the environment. They do not cause flooding – contrary to popular belief they are not made of AstroTurf, but are a mesh-like surface that allows water to drain away. It’s said that they impact on creatures that live in the soil, but I’ve seen worms and indeed weeds come up through mine. I will concede that grass lawns in theory provide clover and daisies for pollinators but a lot of gardeners assiduously get rid of them as soon as they appear.Lastly comes the general “they are awful and man-made and non-U and are destroying wildlife”. Not on my patch of Eden. And here’s why.I use no harmful weed killer. The Sisyphean effort I once spent on cultivating grass is now lavished on an herbaceous border alive with purple flowers for bees (it’s a thing), Erysimum for butterflies and ornamental thistles for the birds. Because the lawn is so neat and tidy I have gone for soft planting elsewhere, including any wild flowers that care to grow, ivy for nests and a dinky pond alive with amphibians and goldfish heck, I even rescue and rear the tadpoles and toadpoles in a bucket so they don’t get eaten.The truth is that not all gardens are suited to grass. They become parched or waterlogged and effective no-go areas for months at a time. I can be outside in all weathers without so much as a trace of mud and that is the single greatest selling point of artificial lawns. They get you out into the garden without pangs of I-really-should-cut-the-grass guilt. There’s head space for hoverflies and red admirals, bobbing wrens and goldfinches. The kids can play games to their heart’s content – you can even choose your gauge of “grass” and go for something hard wearing to accommodate year-round football.Mine is pleasing to the eye and fabulously low maintenance. And my envious neighbours on either side will attest that the grass really is greener on the other side of the fence.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"locals rule devon pub landlady says regulars should prioritised","story":"A Devon pub has imposed its own locals only policy as the landlady insisted her regulars should be prioritised over tourists during the coronavirus pandemic.Sara Roberton said she felt it was unfair usual customers at the King of Prussia Inn may forgo seats in favour of new visitors in the limited space she has available.The landlady indicated holidaymakers should look elsewhere for a beverage in a message left on a chalkboard A-frame on the street in Kingsbridge.The sign reads: LOCALS ONLY and adds in smaller writing: Due to restrictions by Boris!!

That needs to change, because Twitter is a completely different world.”Her quote is telling - not only because it is, of course, quite true that virtue-signalling is pervasive in our social media age - but because Malala is something of a rarity: someone who is correct to describe themselves as an “activist”: Since being shot at age 15 by the Taliban after refusing to be quiet about a girl\u0027s right to education, she has campaigned non-stop, and sticks to getting on with stuff - rather than uploading gratuitous Instagram photos of herself with captions tenuously linked to female empowerment.It is refreshing because many corporations currently rainbow-flagging in favour of Pride rarely back their words with action. Celebrities too (with the exception of non-jet-setting Greta Thunberg) -  take Meghan and Harry’s multi-million Netflix deal to “unlock action”, or Gary Lineker tweeting about refugees while battling HMRC over his freelance earnings . I’m not saying that you need to be shot by the Taliban to be an activist,  but I don’t think a red rose over your profile picture is enough either.Indeed, my friends and I now just roll our eyes at “woke blokes” who reference feminist theory and The  Feminine Mystique  in daily conversation: They’re most often the ones who treat women terribly and threaten to send their nudes about town when rebuffed. Similarly, I am intensely suspicious of people who put “be kind” on their Instagram bio - they tend to be less “kind” because they think kindness is an add-on, not a natural part of anyone’s psyche. Overwhelmingly, I’m starting to suspect that people have a limited amount of energy to devote to good causes - and when you use it all up on hot air about how much you do for other people, you\u0027re too exhausted to actually do anything. Most interesting is that having spent most of my life on the Left, I had always assumed that people on the Right did not do as much for other people. What I found, however, is that Conservatives were often more “activist” than people I’d encountered on the Left - helping with the vaccine roll-out, volunteering at a homeless shelter. They would, however, cringe at the idea of telling people what they do or describing themselves as an “activist”- they don’t do these things to “be kind”, but because they’re the decent thing to do. Indeed, James Bartholomew, who coined the phrase “virtue signal”, found that the Victorians and Edwardians give more to charity than we do now. We forget that people can actually be pretty generous without the performatism of screenshotting a JustGiving pageI like that it is “cool” to talk about certain progressive beliefs - how does anything from racial equality to LGBT rights cascade into awareness otherwise? We wouldn’t say Martin Luther King “virtue-signalled” with his I have a dream speech, nor Jesus in getting nailed to a cross for rabbiting on about Christianity. But the danger in rendering something cool, is that, like with much of social media, the weight is attached to other’s opinions - how will they know you’re doing this good thing? - rather than to your own - “what can you do that would make you feel you are a decent person”?And so, many believe that once they\u0027ve retweeted in favour of Palestine, they can fold their arms, put their legs up - because they\u0027ve done their good deed for the day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mick jagger among celebrities launch campaign save venice becoming","story":"A group of celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger and Tilda Swinton has written an open letter urging the Italian government to protect Venice as tourism re-starts.They are appealing for measures to be taken to prevent Venice from returning to how it was before the pandemic, its soul and unique character slowly leached by the invasion of millions of day-trippers, its churches and canals morphing into “a theme park like Disneyland.”  The 21 actors, film directors and luminaries from the arts world include Swinton, Jagger, James Ivory, Francis Ford Coppola, Wes Anderson and the British-Indian sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor, who recently decided to base his foundation in an historic Venetian palazzo.They have presented a list of 10 points which they say must be addressed to protect the “physical integrity and cultural identity” of Venice as it faces the resumption of mass tourism and the return of giant cruise ships, as well as long-term threats such as rising sea levels and a dwindling population.The 10-point plan includes banning giant cruise liners from the lagoon, providing affordable housing for Venetians, clamping down on apartments being rented out to tourists through platforms such as Airbnb and completing the multi-billion-euro Moses flood protection barrier.They are calling for much stricter regulation of tourist numbers, proposing “a management system based on the example of big museums like the Louvre, where groups can enter only if they have a booking.”The letter comes as tourists start returning to Venice, with some hotels reporting 70 per cent occupancy and the World Heritage city’s narrow alleyways once again thronged with visitors.The first of the season’s huge cruise ships is scheduled to dock on Saturday, despite the government indicating in March that it wanted to ban the liners from ploughing past St Mark’s Square and along the picturesque Giudecca Canal.A protest by Venetians will be staged against the arrival of the MSC Orchestra, which can carry 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew.“Big cruise ships must be definitively banned not only from St Mark’s Basin and the Giudecca Canal but in the whole lagoon,” the signatories said in their appeal.While many Venetians depend on visitors for their livelihoods, others view the return of mass tourism with dread - before the pandemic, Venice was flooded by an estimated 25 million visitors a year.The signatories also include Richard Armstrong, the director of the Solomon Guggenheim Museum in New York, Karole Vail, the director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice and Françoise Nyssen, a French former minister of culture.The letter was drawn up by Venetian Heritage, a non-profit foundation, which sent it to Mario Draghi, the prime minister, Sergio Mattarella, Italy’s president, Luca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto region and Luigi Brugnaro, the mayor of Venice.Toto Bergamo Rossi, the director of Venetian Heritage, dismissed any criticism that wealthy celebrities should keep their noses out of Venetians’ business.“Venice is Italy’s only international city. Its heritage belongs to the world. The people who signed the letter are not just a collection of well-known names.They are really involved with the city and several are on the board of our foundation,” he told The . “Like many Venetians, they want a city that is better than it was before the pandemic. It was total anarchy before. But we now have an opportunity, before mass tourism returns, to change things.”The population of Venice has dropped to just 50,000. “Every year we are less and less and Venice becomes more and more fake. If we don’t act now, it will be like Disneyland – only a Third World version, without the organisation of Disneyland.”Matteo Secchi, the head of Venessia, a civil society group that campaigns against over-tourism and other issues, welcomed the initiative.“It’s important because people listen to celebrities and people who have a high-profile,” he told The . “It shows that Venice is of interest to the whole world. It’s a positive thing, but we also need concrete action – we’ve been campaigning on these issues for years.”Now is a good time to act, just before tourists return en masse. “They are coming back gradually but we are still missing the British, the Americans and the Asians,” said Mr Secchi. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new british tanks costing 35bn cannot driven safely 20mph reveals","story":"A new fleet of tanks bought by the Army for £3.5 billion cannot be driven safely over 20mph, a leaked report has revealed.Military chiefs have been warned that the new Ajax armoured fighting vehicles pose safety risks to soldiers if they are driven at more than half their fastest speed.It comes after trials of the vehicles had to be suspended from November 2020 to March of this year, after it was found troops had suffered swollen joints and tinnitus while being inside the vehicles.In a Government report seen by The  it states that safety limitations on the tanks include “speed restrictions of 20mph” as well as “limiting time in the platform to 1hr 30mins before crew change”.The report warns that due to the speed restrictions, which are understood to be caused by design flaws that have resulted in excessive vibrations that prevent cannons being fired on the move, the Household Cavalry regiment “cannot conduct effective collective training on the platform”.  Meanwhile, it states that due to safety limitations the current design means “the vehicle cannot reverse over an obstacle more than 20cm high”.The report, which is due to be published next month but is understood to have been seen by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), adds: “The review team were told there is a real risk exposing the Field Army to the platforms in their current condition will undermine their confidence in Ajax.All soldiers who currently operate inside the tank must now have an ear test and wear noise-cancelling headsets, however it is understood that problems with vibration and noise levels were reported as early as 2017.One defence source claimed that the army is “so embarrassed about having to admit it’s failed, they won’t do it”.The MoD said it is committed to the Ajax programme, which will form a key component in the Army’s modernised warfighting ision, with current plans for Initial Operating for its scheduled deployment this summer. However, only 14 of the turretless Ares variant, which are manufactured by General Dynamics, the American aerospace and defence company, have so far been delivered.The programme to deliver a new family of armoured fighting vehicles was decided in 2010, with 589 different variants of the vehicle ordered in 2014.The vision was for the tanks to replace the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) armoured fighting vehicles, but it has been plagued by problems ever since and is four years behind schedule to be deployed.Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis, said: “The Army and the MoD have got to realise that they have got a problem on their hands. Throwing money at this is what they\u0027ve done for the last four years, and they have not solved any of the problems.

It is displayed for the first time, alongside Messel’s original design sketch of the dress. Princess Margaret wore it to a costume ball in July 1964 at London’s Mansion House, in aid of St John’s Ambulance.Messel, the uncle of Margaret’s husband, Lord Snowden, was better known as a stage designer, but was also an influential architect. He went on to design her home on the island of Mustique.The exhibition also features Diana’s wedding dress, designed by Emanuel, made from silk woven in Suffolk and lace made in Nottingham.It was last displayed at Kensington Palace in 1996 and permission was sought from the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex for it to be part of the exhibition.Acott Williams said the exhibition, which runs from June 3 until January 2 2022, was a “once in a decade” opportunity for the public to see the dress in person. Textiles, particularly silks, can degrade “very quickly” under light or humidity, she added.“We keep all of our light levels very low, generally under 50 lux, and that’s always for a very limited period of time,” she said. “In normal circumstances it’s kept in the dark, in neutral materials that don’t give off any kind of chemicals that would increase that rate of decay.“Particularly silk, we’d only display it for very short periods because it can really ... disintegrate quite easily, which is why something like this will never go on display more frequently than every 10 years.”The pattern for the wedding dress, which has never been displayed before, also features in the exhibition. It is the first time the pattern and the dress have been featured together since it left the Emanuel atelier the day before the wedding in 1981.Following the wedding, Diana changed into a pink silk day dress, known as her “going away” outfit, designed by Bellville Sassoon.The dress is displayed at the exhibition with a short sleeve bolero jacket, but a long sleeve version was also created in case of bad weather. She wore the dress again in Australia in 1982, and to open a hospital in Grimsby in 1983.A cotton calico toile worn by The Queen Mother for fittings prior to the coronation, in 1937, also features in the exhibition.Designer Madame Handley-Seymour used the toile - a prototype garment - to improve the shape and fit of the final dress.The intricate gown was painted with gold detail to represent the emblems of the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.Mr Storey said: “We are proud to open the exhibition with Madame Handley-Seymour, who combined astute business sense with design talent.“As a court dressmaker, well versed in the rules of dressing for royal ceremonial occasions, she was the perfect choice to make Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother’s 1937 coronation gown.“She had already won the Queen’s complete confidence by designing her debutante dress and wedding gown, which had won praise with its fashionable drop-waisted 1920s silhouette.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"top ten year 2021 entries","story":"This year, 331 entrants are vying for the title of Cuprinol Shed of the Year, more than double the number in 2020.The lockdown category introduced in last year\u0027s competition has been retained, with several DIY bars created as pubs in England remained closed until coronavirus restrictions began to ease in April. A public vote through readerssheds decided each winnerHere: Ally Scott with her entry The Peculiar Pear, in Southampton, Hampshire, a frontrunner in the Workshop and Studio categoryBoris Johnson says there is still ‘nothing in the data’ to delay June 21 unlocking -

Mr Miliband, , quit as party chief in the aftermath of the ballot box disaster which delivered the first outright Tory majority in  years. But he is back on Labour’s frontbench as Shadow Business Secretary. Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the party leadership in , pointed to the infamous picture of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich as an example of the intense scrutiny that comes with being leader of the Opposition. He claimed looking back at his five-year premiership was more stressful than experiencing it at the time. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “I’ve definitely had therapy both before and after it,” he told the Table Manners podcast. “That’s why going back into the frontline is quite anxiety-making because the experience of last time was like I ate a sandwich in a particular way etc, etc, etc. “There are definitely sacrices in being a frontline politician.” Like politics news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Askedat any point he felt relieved to have lost the election, he said: “I definitely felt, ‘At least I’m no longer a target’, but overwhelmingly, obviously, I wish I’d won. “Oddly enough, the stress at the time – I just felt it was part of the job and it’s only looking back on it it almost feels more stressful in retrospect than it felt at the time. “Once you’re in it you’ve got to do it. You think, ‘Well, nobody forced me to do this, I wanted to do it, I know the reason I’m doing it, the cause is what’s driving me forward to make the country fair and I think I can do a better job than Cameron’. “That’s what drove me forward and it’s when you then think back on it you think, ‘Oh, God’.” Dad-of-two Mr Miliband said his health had “definitely” improved since quitting as leader. He added: “It’s quite a stressful experience. “I wanted to do it and I felt I had something distinctive and important to say and that is a unique privilege to have done it, and I wouldn’t wish I hadn’t done it. “But it definitely takes its toll and also there is something about being part of a team working for sort of a common goal which is quite unique, and you get a chance to talk to the country about where the country is, how things need to change – that is a big thing. “I don’t regret doing it. “I think the biggest sacrice is about family, the intrusion into your family le. “My kids were even younger then, obviously.” Mr Miliband has been back in the spotlight since April last year when he was plucked from the backbenches for the business brief. “I’m now back on the front line in a sense, not as leader obviously – Shadow Business and Energy Secretary – but you do have a hesitation about that because the last experience of the frontline was quite full on,” he said.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyLabour PartyEd MilibandDavid CameronTherapyPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"four tests june 21 end","story":"NewsFour tests for June  end of lockdown explained - and are we meeting them Boris Johnson is facing calls to delay the final stage of the lockdown roadmap amid fears over the spread of an infections new iant.

But Covid cases have been rising as the B... ‘Indian’ iant becomes dominant in this country. And while deaths are not shooting up yet, the government is still awaiting crucial data on how damaging it will be. The key thing we need to know is how much more transmissible the new iant is than aposregularapos Covid .  Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam had said we might get a “ranging shot” last week, but that came and went. Boris Johnson needs to announce on June ,  days’ time, whether step four can go ahead as planned. Today he said: “I can see nothing in the data at the moment that means we can’t go ahead with… all the reopening on June .” But the Prime Minister immediately added “the data is just still ambiguous” and “we’ve just got to wait a little bit longer”. Scotland has already slowed down its unlocking - prompting furious pressure on Tory MPs for Boris Johnson to forge ahead. So how will we decide whether to forge ahead with the roadmap   Ultimately it’s a political decision for Boris Johnson based on scientic advice - but it will be based on passing four key tests. Here’s what they are - and how things are looking. Vaccines are rolling out The first test - that “the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully” - is the easiest passing grade for the government. Three-quarters of adults have now had a first dose of the jab, and ministers are working towards an unofficial target to get second doses to all over-s and vulnerable groups by June . This isn’t perfect, because it takes weeks for protection to build up, but is ahead of the government’s own plans. In England, first doses have gone to % of under-s, % of -s, % of -s, % of -s and % of -s. Among over-s, take-up is above % in every single age group. Plans look well on track to offer first doses to all adults by July .  Vaccines are reducing hospitalisations and deaths The second test is that “vaccines are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated”. So far this is a pretty big tick, though it could be upset by the new iant posing more resistance to the jab . Cases are much lower among the over-s age group, who are more likely to have had both doses, than younger Brits. ONS estimates suggest just  in , over-s would have tested positive for Covid on May .  That compares to  in  people aged  to ,  in , people aged  to , and  in  young people aged  to . But it’s important to note though that the vaccine is not % effective some people can’t get the jab and even when most older people are vaccinated, they still account for the most deaths. Of deaths in the week to May ,  were in over-s. Just  were of people aged  to  and just three were under . Case rates do not risk an ‘unsustainable’ surge to hospital The third test is that “infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS”. This is important, because it’s not just about the number of cases, or even the number of hospital cases - both of which are rising. The UK recorded , new positive cases yesterday - and the rolling average is up % in a week. Hospital admissions of people with Covid are up % in a week, with  new patients entering beds on May .  While a historic zero deaths were recorded on Monday, that was a bank holiday and another  were recorded on Tuesday. This surge is worrying and,it continues to rise exponentially, is a big problem. But will it put “unsustainable pressure” on the NHS On the one hand, the vaccine is helping break the link between cases andseriouscases. We’re at a much lower base of hospital cases now than in mid-September, when  a day were being admitted.But on the other hand, hospitals are already almost at capacity because they’re trying to clear backlogs of other cases. So it wouldn’t take much to tip them over the edge. New iants do not ‘fundamentally’ change the risks The fourth test - that “our assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new Variants of Concern” - is the trickiest. The two questions we must answer are how transmissible the B... ‘Indian’ iant is, and whether it evades vaccines. On the first question, Prof Van-Tam suggested it could be anywhere between a few per cent and % more transmissible.  But we still don’t have the data to stack this up - so it’s an open question. On the second question, there is some evidence the existing jabs work on the iant, but it’s not totally conclusive yet. Promising Public Health England data shows that from , Indian iant sufferers up to May , only  were known to have received both doses of the vaccine. Last month PHE said the Pfizer vaccine is % effective against symptoms of the Indian iant after a second shot, compared with % against the Kent strain. But one dose is only % effective – prompting a scramble to deliver more.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"woman conceived via sperm donor","story":":root Woman conceived via sperm donor on mission to meet  half siblings - and countingEXCLUSIVE: Paramedic Kianni Arroyo, , from Florida, grew up knowing she was conceived via a sperm donor.

Instead of having a mum and a dad, Kianni had two mums. “I saw a bunch of other kids with their dads and I thought, ‘why don’t I have one of those ’ and started asking questions when I was about four years old,” Kianni, , told The Mirror. “My mum said she wanted a baby so badly so she went to the doctor for help. Then she picked out a special seed and the doctor planted it in Mummy’s tummy.” As she got older, Kianni, who lives in Florida, USA, started to understand she’d been conceived via sperm donor. Although content with her childhood, she often wondered about who her donor was. “I used to make Father’s Day cards for my donor because I didn’t have a dad. I never did anything with them,” she recalled.  For years, Kianni’s donor had a private profile, meaning children conceived from his sperm couldn’t know anything about him. But after seeing Kianni in a promotional video for the donor company Xytex, he changed his mind. “The company told my mum they thought I was the first live birth to come from my donor’s sperm,” Kianni, who is a paramedic, explained. When Kianni’s donor made his profile public, it meant she could make contact with him when she turned . “I started searching for him just before I turned  because I wanted to meet him as soon as possible. As the first born from his sperm, I knew I’d be the first child he met.  “I’m a ball of energy and I always want to be doing something. When I was younger I picked up surfing and painting but no one on my mum’s side of the family does that stuff. “I had a packet of information about my donor which said he was artistic and athletic and I realised it came from him. I wondered what  I’d got from him,” she said. But while she waited for her th birthday to come around, Kianni found another way to connect with her roots - by finding her siblings. She signed onto a register with the sperm bank which marked her down as the offspring of her donor’s sperm and hoped others would follow.  When she was , a family made contact with her - the mother had twin girls who shared a donor with Kianni. She said: “They came to Florida on holiday to go to DisneyWorld and I only live  minutes away, so I decided to go and meet them. “They were only three years old so they didn’t really understand who I was - they just knew I was ‘sister’. “They were joined to my hip all day and it was an amazing feeling to experience being a real big sister. I grew up as an only child but after I met them I realised this was what it was like to have siblings.” As time passed, Kianni met about  of her siblings while she counted down the days to her th birthday - when she’d finally be allowed to meet her donor. When the day came around, she realised how many things she’d inherited from him and they got along well. Now, she meets him once a year. “It really helps me learn more about myself,” she said. “It’s so nice to have contact with him, not so much as a parent, but a friend.” Meanwhile, Kianni’s donor register kept growing, and she realised there were dozens more siblings out there than she’d previously thought.  “I think there are  that I know of, but there will be more we don’t know about,” she said. Among the brood are several sets of twins and one set of triplets. Whereas most of the siblings are in the US and Canada, Kianni has discovered some younger siblings on the other side of the planet in Australia and New Zealand. The youngest children are three years old and, whereas Kianni always thought she was the oldest, she’s found a sister who appears to be four months older than her.In her home state of Florida, Kianni has  siblings - some of whom she meets up with often.

Will Tyler was left temporarily unable to walk and in need of a skin graft after the incident at Formby Beach in Merseyside. The youngster, who was then aged nine, had gone on a day trip to the beach with his parents Toby and Claire, and his sister Lily last summer The family, along with their friends the Morley family, were visiting from Stockport, and had deliberately hiked across the sand dunes to avoid the crowds. This meant Willaposs dad was forced run across the dunes carrying his injured son for  minutes in the summer heat back to the car so his mum could get him to hospital in the June ,  incident.  They set up a disposable barbecue to enjoy some sausage sandwiches, and then once the barbecue had cooled, moved it to one side, far away from the children, so the youngsters could run around and play.Willaposs dad Toby told the Liverpool Echo : Everyone I’ve told this story to just cannot believe how sand can stay that hot.We’d used one of those disposable barbecues where the coals are in a foil tray. The bottom of the tray was on the sand, which I now know meant the heat was being sent down into the sand and the foil surface was trapping it there.  “When we moved the barbecue, the top of the sand cooled, but underneath it was still roasting hot as the heat had just been trapped there. We learned later it can stay dangerously hot for hours and hours. The kids were running around playing when suddenly Will just screamed. As a parent, it’s the worst sound I’d ever heard and it’s a sound I’ll never forget.  He pulled his foot out of the sand and his skin was peeling off his foot like melted wax. By the time I carried him to the car I was I was soaking wet with sweat. I wasn’t sure I was going to make it but seeing Will’s foot….I guess the adrenaline just kicked in.” Mum Claire drove Will to a nearby hospital before he was taken to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital.  From there it was a slow recovery process, initially spending nine days and eight nights in hospital unable to have visitors other than his mum, and in a lot of pain. Will had to have a skin graft from his right thigh to his left foot and was given morphine, gas and air to help him get through the pain. Once home, Will’s recovery was far from over and he relied on a wheelchair at first, before progressing to a walking frame and crutches and eventually was able to walk unaided again.  He still has to wear compression socks  hours a day and a splint at night, as well as moisturising his skin and massaging the skin to reduce bumps in the scar tissue. Toby continued: “He has fun with it – he calls it his ‘bacon’ because that’s what it looks like. As he’s still growing we’re not surethere will be operations in future. But for now he is recovering well and he’s lucky that he has some close friends that have been really great at supporting him.  The family have shared their story as Will, now , is fundraising for Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital - where he is still attending appointments all these months on after his injury. He said: “I wanted to do some fundraising themed around the number eight because that’s how many nights I was in the children’s hospital. “It was really dficult because it was last year during lockdown so my sister Lily and my dad weren’t able to visit me, I was only with my mum. But all the nurses were nice to me and everyone on the ward was really kind. Part of Willaposs fundraising efforts saw him and  other people take part in an km walk on Formby Beach on Tuesday. Other activities include an km paddle in the River Mersey and eight friends having their heads shaved.To find out more visit Willaposs JustGiving page.

A spokesperson for MSC told the Independent: “We can confirm that the present requirement of a fully valid UK passport for all British guests wishing to book one of our UK voyages is in line with requirements we have received from Border Force UK.” But a Home Office spokesperson has denied this is a legal requirement. “This is not Border Force guidance and this guidance has not been given to MSC Cruises by Border Force, a spokesperson told the Independent. “If cruise ships are staying in UK waters then passengers would not need six months validity on their passports.” The Daily Mirror has contacted cruise firm MSC for a comment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBorder ForceHome Office"},{"url":null,"title":"covid infection rates rising 68","story":":root Covid infection rates rising in  per cent of areas in England - see full listOf the  local regions across the country,  have seen an increase for the seven days to May , a total of  have seen a fall and  remain unchanged, official data showsCovid infection rates rising in  per cent of areas in England - see full listOf the  local regions across the country,  have seen an increase for the seven days to May , a total of  have seen a fall and  remain unchanged, official data showsBlackburn with Darwen in Lancashire continues to have the highest rate Image: Julian Hamilton Daily MirrorByJonathan ColesReporter:,  Jun Updated:,  Jun Covid infection rates are rising in  per cent of areas across England, figures show - as questions remain over unlocking on June .

Princes William and Harry, who technically own the dress, have loaned it to Historic Royal Palaces to form a centrepiece of the Royal Style in the Making exhibition which opens today. The exhibition will offer visitors a sneak peek into the rarefied world of the atelier, unpicking how some of Britain’s finest designers rose to the challenge of creating clothing destined for the world stage. Diana’s dress will be on show until January, alongside never-before-seen items from the archives of some of the most celebrated royal couturiers. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  Complete with its  ft train - the longest in royal history - it is set alongside examples of the stylish ensembles created for Princess Diana, the Queen and the Queen Mother. The exhibition also tracks the development of Dianaaposs style from her peach aposgoing awayapos honeymoon outfit to the sleek evening gowns she wore more than a decade later. Among the star items on display will be a rare surviving toile for the  coronation gown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, consort of King George VI. Created by London based court designer Madame Handley-Seymour - a favoured couturier of the dowager Queen Mary with an innate understanding of the rules and tradition of royal dress – the silk satin gown with its golden national emblems was the perfect choice to embody continuity at the start of an unexpected new reign. The toile is an extraordinary full-size working pattern of the completed gown, and features the stunning design for the embroidery hand-painted onto it, highlighting the attention to detail required in planning for such an important state occasion.  Matthew Storey, exhibition curator at Historic Royal Palaces, said: “Our summer exhibition at Kensington Palace will shine a spotlight on some of the greatest talents of British design, whose work has been instrumental in shaping the visual identity of the royal family across the twentieth century. “We’ll be exploring how the partnership between each designer and client worked, and revealing the process behind the creation of a number of the most important couture commissions in royal history. “While one of the highlights will undoubtedly be Diana, Princess of Wales’s show stopping Emanuel designed wedding dress, - which goes on show at the palace for the first time in  years – we’ve got some real surprises up our sleeve for fashion fans!”Visit hrp.org.uk Kensington-Palace whats-on royal-style-in-the-making for more information.

Paul Charles, chief executive of the PC Agency travel consultancy, has revealed the eight countries he believes will be turned from amber to green when the government reviews the traffic light system later this week. The travel analyst has a good track record when it comes to predicting which countries the UK will allow quarantine-free travel to. He predicted in April that “pretty well all of Europe” would be categorised amber when the international travel ban was lted on May , while noting Portugal and Gibraltar as exceptions. It’s believed officials are hoping to announce the first update this Thursday to take effect on Monday June . They hope Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will confirm the update at a pm press conference - but that could slip.  Ahead of the update, whenever it comes, Mr Charles has announced the eight countries he thinks will make the list. It should be noted that not even Mr Shapps knows how the list will change until a few hours before the announcement, as it is decided by the Joint Biosecurity centre.They look at a iety of factors including iants in the country, coronavirus case and vaccine rates, how good that country is at genomic sequencing and how good the overall data in the country is. Mr Charlesapos analysis focuses on two of these factors - coronavirus case and vaccination rates. Brits can travel from the UK to green list nations and back again and not have to quarantine, making it a major pull for those without unlimited days to take off work. However, Brits arriving home from green list countries must still take two Covid tests - one before they catch theirflight, and the other on Day  after arrival. Canary Islands After months of lockdown and a miserable May, spending a week on a volcanic archipelago while basking in glorious sunshine sounds like a good idea. While the Canary Islands are currently categorised as amber, their figures are very similar to green list country Portugal.  According to PC Agency data, it has a case rate of . per , people and . per cent of its population vaccinated once. This compares to . per cent of people jabbed and . cases per , people in Portugal. Finland  Not one of the most well trod holiday destinations but a cultural hotspot on the eastern edge of Scandinavia, maybe now is the time to get that heavy knit jumper out of the cupboard and head to Helsinki. At the moment . per cent of its population has been jabbed and its coronavirus rate is  ,. Balearic Islands  If those one goes green it will be a huge boost for British travellers. Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and the many smaller islands dotted in-between are bound to be a huge draw for those wanting some kind of release. Itaposs understood the government wants to separate out the biggest island hotspots from their host territories in future updates, so the Balearics could get the green light ahead of Spain.  At the moment Spain has a jab rate of . per cent and a coronavirus rate of . , compared to . and  , for the Balearics. Barbados  Perhaps the ultimate iteration of sun, sea and sand, this amber list country looks ripe to be turned green. At the moment its vaccination rate is middling at . per cent, but only . cases of coronavirus are being recorded per , people. If Barbados goes green then it may well be time to invest in a new pair of flipflops. Malta  This small Mediterranean archipelago is another favoured holiday destination which looks set to be turned green. It has a sky-high vaccination rate of  per cent and a coronavirus rate of . ,, which are signicantly better figures than many countries currently on the green list. Morocco  If the PC Agencyaposs analysis is right, then Morocco will also be turned green. While a lot of the places that may be added offered unrivalled beaches and blue seas, Morocco has both the stunning resorts and sprawling historical cities to intrigue incomers.  With a . per cent jab rate and . , coronavirus cases, it also has good figures. Grenada  One of the few countries in the world that has a coronavirus case rate of  ,.

A trilogy of women have now been his we. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting dferent results, but third time lucky, eh, Carrie  Maybe he really has changed. The post-nuptial photo they released was spun as a couple “gazing ­adoringly” at each other. This was % more honest than most of what’s come out of Downing Street of late, in that it was half true. Carrie genuinely is gazing adoringly. ­Johnson’s expression is best described as blank, dazed. His fist is clenched, but not quite so tightly that you can’t notice it seems he’s chosen not to wear a wedding ring. There’s no doubt that he’s picked the right woman.To marry him at this point takes a very specic type of person – let alone to marry him at a moment when the vows might as well have been: “To love, honour and distract from what Dominic Cummings said”. Johnson is – at the very, very least – notoriously a serial ­adulterer. He’s, so far, as ­incompetent at being a husband as he is at everything . He married his already pregnant second fiancee  days after his first marriage ended. During that blissful union he had an affair with a woman who recently revealed they’d had sex at his house, on the family sofa, minutes before his then-we came home. Johnson is also famously, ­provenly, almost proudly, dishonest across the board – an equal opportunities liar.So to marry him now, with no illusion left unshattered, is an act of extreme… let’s be charitable, and go with optimism. Carrie is clearly of the school of glass like totally half full, yah Someone with faith the toast will land butter side up, and, more importantly, who expects to see a striped leopard any day now, because it has changed its spots.She presumably goes by the logic thatit looks like a duck and quacks like a duck there might actually be a totally innocent explanation for it being something entirely dferent to a duck. After all, once a cheater, always a chance to do things dferently from now on. Maybe she classes being married as information, and is therefore buoyed by her husband’s new mantra of data, not dates . This rose-tinted mindset will serve Carrie well in the future, becausethere’s ever someone who can convincingly say they have to work late again, it’s the Prime Minister.Well, some Prime Ministers. Is writing the Shakespeare book still a plausible alibi  Boris, Boris, wherefore art thou, Boris  Still, at least when Carrie does eventually get to take a proper honeymoon, she’ll be able to keep the cost low. No, not because the deep ­pocketed Tory donors might step in – but because she can just hitch a ride on a flying pig.

There are few records of how -at all - Henry III, Edward III and James VI and I celebrated their -year milestones.

In  the Queen travelled over , miles by air around the UK and the world including Jamaica, New Zealand and Australia and Canada during the Jubilee. The gardens of Buckingham Palace were used for public concerts for the first time ever during the Golden Jubilee Central Weekend.  An estimated one million people watched outside the Palace in The Mall and around the Queen Victoria Memorial and  million on television as artists including Phil Collins, Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey celebrated the historic occasion. The event finished with Queen guitarist Brian May playing on the roof of Buckingham Palace while Roger played with the orchestra on the stage as the band belted out a version of God Save the Queen. In , The Queen became only the second British Monarch to celebrate a Diamond Jubilee, marking  years on the throne, with a spectacular concert once again held outside the palace. Organised by Take That singer-songwriter Gary Barlow and attended by the Queen, who arrived at  pm to rapturous applause from thousands of people who had attended through a ballot. Concert ticket holders were given access to the palace gardens for an afternoon picnic before the main event. They were served cold hampers with a British-themed menu specially designed by Heston Blumenthal and the royal chef Mark Flanagan.

The same applies to the Bank Holidays on Friday, April  and Monday, April . If you take April , , ,  as annual leave, you can actually be off for  days in total - from April  to Sunday, April .  The Early May Bank Holiday falls on May , which is a Thursday. If you take Monday to Wednesday off and count the previous and following weekend, you could be off for nine days. For the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday, hard-working Brits can get nine days off work by booking just three days’ worth of holiday.

Full-time workers in the UK are entitled to  days paid leave a year, and some employers choose to include Bank Holidays. Generally, workers need to request annual leave with as much notice as possible. Although employers can refuse to give leave at a certain time, they cannot refuse to let workers take the leave at all. During some periods of the year, employers can ask their staff to take leave, for example at Christmas. They could also restrict when leave can be taken, for example at busy periods, or when several employees want to be off at the same time.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBanksRoyal FamilyPublic servicesHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"inside britains best sheds including","story":"NewsInside Britains best sheds including bra HQ, priests chapel, snug bar and castleIts that time of the year again as we step inside the most incredible sheds competing in the Cuprinol Shed of the Year  - and the need to work from home during the Covid- pandemic has seen shed-loving Brits really up their game...mirrorShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyReporterTim Stewart:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsFather Len Black in his shed, the Oratory of St Joseph \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

From cosy garden snugs to train carriage transformations - these self-confessed shed-heads have all made it to the final of this year’s Cuprinol Shed of the Year competition. A record-breaking  hopefuls vying for glory entered the th annual ‘shed-to-shed’ challenge - with lockdown producing some of the most whacky entries yet. Catholic Priest Father Len Black, , submitted his own summerhouse where he has held Holy Mass since . Throughout lockdown, the shed, in Inverness, Scotland, has served as a beacon of comfort as Father Len Black streamed his services across the globe - attracting viewers from as far away as Australia. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Highland priest Fr Black has been streaming his masses live from The Oratory Of St Joseph summerhouse in Inverness via Zoom several times a week. Fr Black, who is pastor to the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in Scotland, said he had been determined not to let lockdown restrictions come between people and their faith. The tech-savvy Catholic priest said: I found that using Zoom to broadcast my masses is very valuable, especially for people who are isolated on their own. Itaposs created an opportunity to feel part of the church despite the fact that we are all in lockdown.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Thereaposs the spiritual side that people are getting the nourishment of the mass albeit in a peculiar way through zoom. And thereaposs also the social side of it thataposs important for peopleaposs morale, just to feel that weaposve at least got these friends that we can meet up with a couple of times a week. Former Navy veteran Nicholas Pointing from Sandown, on the Isle of Wight, also submitted his creation of a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-inspired shed, hoping he can chug away with first prize in the competition’s workshop studio category. Meanwhile Alex Reynolds designed The Snug - a cosy pub in the garden of his Consett, Co. Durham, home. This year’s competition featured an added ‘lockdown’ category, with entrants including Mark Campbell’s wooden ‘Winterwood’ castle - nestled in the bluebells of his Wingerworth garden in Derbyshire. Kieran Bentham, of Otley, also entered his cabin into the mix, hoping to scoop first prize in the summerhouse category - competing with Joanna van Blommestein for her shed, The Bra Boss in Faversham, Kent, where she runs her own lingerie boutique. Head judge and competition founder Andrew Wilcox said: “The past year has been an incredibly challenging time for all of us and, now more than ever, we’re aware of how important the humble shed can be. “Sheds are not just unloved, brown structures at the bottom of the garden that house tools and household junk, they are vital spaces where you can go to relax, work on a project or burn off some steam.  “The high-calibre entries this year really prove why we set up the competition in the first place - to highlight the valuable role sheds can play in our lives, in our businesses and the positive impact they have on our wellbeing.” A total of  finalists have now been chosen, with public voting closing on Monday, July . Instagram influencer and model Danielle Zarb-Cousin created a chic aposshag padapos shed bar to get over a bad break-up. Danielle, , was in need of a stf drink after she was unceremoniously dumped by her fiancé, Love Island star Jonny Mitchell.  She announced the traumatising split to her , Instagram followers by sharing a video of herself in a wedding dress in December . The following summer, Danielle threw herself into creating s-inspired Creme de Menthe bar from the empty shed in her parentsapos garden in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. And now she has been recognised for her renovation skills by becoming a finalist in the annual contest Cuprinol Shed of the Year . She said: My shed really helped to get over my split. I had nothing  to do.  The last thing you want after a break-up is not to see anyone and to be on your own. I couldnapost go out and see my friends or start dating again, so the shed became a massive focus for me during lockdown. The shed was brown, unused and empty and my parents were going to knock it down. But I thought it was a perfectly good shed and I was bored during lockdown, so I thought I would do something with it. It is now very colourful, bright and cheerful. I painted everything myself inside and outside, including the orange beams and bar itself. Everything in the shed was sourced from charity shops and second hard vintage furniture shops when they were open between lockdowns. My mum found me vintage records and everything built up over time.  Danielle shared a picture of herself painting the shed sporting a sizzling black swimsuit and clutching a large glass of white wine. The model has since shown off her curves regularly while posing in bikinis in front of her garden sanctuary. But lockdown has prevented her having any wild shed parties - for now. She said: I have been blogging from the shed. It is a really nice environment to write from. Iaposm looking forward to having some parties after lockdown eases as all everyone wants to talk about now is my shed. Placed in the Pub Entertainment category, her shed is one of the  finalists that now go to a public vote and then before judges to pick an overall winner.She said: One of my friends said I should enter and I thought it was a joke. I had to Google it to see that the competition was a thing. I never expected to make the final but now I have been looking at all the other entries and they are all so creative and uniquely dferent. Danielleaposs rivals for the title include specialist bra-fitter Joanna, , who built the lingerie boutique Bra Boss in Faversham, Kent The former Gossard sales manager had only just started her own business in her charming converted summerhouse when the nation into lockdown.  She said: When I was a rep, I would always say that things would go full circle and people would go back to more of the independent stores again. I think the lockdown has shown people how lovely it is to shop and support local and that online shopping can be quite boring - and more importantly you shouldnapost just buy your bras online without trying them on. And in the Natureaposs Haven category, archaeologist Rebecca Roseff built a medieval-inspired shelter - called Batbarn - in Colwall, Herefordshire, to support rare horseshoe bat colonies for their summer roosts.  Another shed is a replica castle. Organisers said that staging the th annual Cuprinol Shed of the Year contest during the pandemic has highlighted the health benefits of having a garden retreat.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnShedsCuprinol"},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton trying mediate between","story":"NewsKate Middleton trying to end feud between William and Harry before its too lateThe Duchess of Cambridge is a \"brilliant peacemaker\" said her uncle Gary Goldsmith.

Goldsmith, , who is brother to Kateaposs mother Carole, described the duchess as a brilliant arbiter and peacemaker and insisted she is doing everything she can to make things right between her husband and his brother. He said the Duke of Sussex, , needs to get a grip and stop his self-indulgent episode before it gets to the point where there is no common ground or relationship to rebuild. The Ibiza-based recruitment consultant said everyone has been left astonished by Harryaposs outbursts, which include accusing the Royal Family of racism and neglect in a series of interviews with Oprah Winfrey.  He told Closer: If Harry doesnapost get a grip and stop this self-indulgent episode, there will soon be no common ground or relationship to rebuild. Butanyone can bring peace to the royals, Kate can. Kate is a brilliant arbiter and peacemaker. Every bone in her body is about making friends and doing the best she can... sheaposs trying to mediate. Prince Charles has come in for criticism with Harry saying he did not do enough to look after him and William following Diana’s death.  The Duke of Sussex also said Charles and William are both “trapped” within the Royal Family. Harry has been opening up in ious interviews in the US with his latest a series on mental health that he has co-produced with Oprah Winfrey called “The Me You Can’t See”.Goldsmith said it was evident at Prince Philip ’s funeral how she sought to get William and Harry talking.He continued: “You could see at the funeral that Kate was there trying to make peace, bringing the brothers together.  “Harry and Kate were great friends, they were a trio with William and a strong unit. Family and relationships are everything to Kate – she’s very nurturing, she wouldn’t like that [rt] happening and she is trying to look after her husband and do what she can to make things right.” Harry has said he is more relaxed now living in Calornia, saying that le as a royal was like living in a “zoo”. He claimed he knew when he was in his early s that he didn’t want to be there.He has also said that the Royal Family were not supportive of him and his we Meghan Markle after they got married and especially when she was struggling with her mental health.

Speaking to LBC radio, he said: It shows that the enormous sacrices of the British people are starting to really deliver. The fact that the British people have gone out there with verve and gusto and actually got vaccinated when so many other nations have not had that same level of take-up is a real credit. It is promising what weaposve seen in terms of zero deaths but we canapost be complacent. We continue to be careful and weaposve got to make sure we continue to get vaccinated. Mr Williamson added that was a sense in Government that there had been really promising progress towards scrapping all restrictions on June , adding: Youaposre right to say it is about data, not dates, but the vaccines are having an impact in terms of actually reducing transmission, reducing the number of people in hospital and it is these factors that are going to guide the decision.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan  harry want attend","story":"NewsMeghan  Harry want to attend Queens  Jubilee in fresh headache for palaceDuke and Duchess want to attend but insider says it could cause problems, while Harry is set toto UK for Diana statue unveilingmirrorShareCommentsByAdam Barnett:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-harry-claim-queen-snubbed-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dxpwX,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A spokesman added: “The encampment was set up last night at about pm after they were moved on from the Long Walk. “The council is aware and in line with policy and statutory requirements on us welfare visits are being undertaken before any decisions are made on how to proceed. “The situation will continue to be actively monitored to ensure that the impact on local residents and the environment is minimised.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnRoyal FamilyThe QueenCaravans"},{"url":null,"title":"uk covid daily infections up","story":"NewsUK Covid daily infections up % in a week as  more die amid Indian iant spreadDaily infection figures have topped , for seven days in a row, and rose to , on Wednesday, a day after the UK welcomed its first zero death toll in monthsmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe death toll rose by  on Wednesday, official figures show \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Lauren Stacey, , has shared before and after photos of the mishap as a cautionary tale to sun-seekers across Britain while temperatures rise. Despite applying SPF  sun lotion to most of her body, she missed a spot on her forehead - and woke up the next morning barely able to see. When she looked in the mirror she was horried to find her face had ballooned. Lauren was on a girlaposs holiday to Barbados in  when she suffered the severe reaction - known as cholinergic urticaria - which is caused by an increase in body temperature. It left her looking so unrecognisable that the digital face scanner at the airport mortyingly failed to identy her on the way home days later. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  I woke up feeling a little off. I tried to open my eyes but couldnapost and asked my friendmy face looked normal, Lauren said. She gasped when she saw my face and told me to take a look in the mirror. I looked and my eyes were sticky and I could barely see because they had swollen that much. My whole face had swelled to the point where I looked like a monster. Thankfully, after a course of steroids and antihistamines, the swelling reduced and she made a full recovery. Now, with temperatures hitting mid-s this week, Lauren is warning others to be more cautious when applying sun-cream.  Itaposs scary to think sun burn can turn so sinister, Lauren said. Please take care and look after your skin. Lauren, from Swansea, South Wales, says she initially had normal sunburn, and it wasnapost until the next morning that her face felt puffy. Despite the setback, she was determined to have a good time for the rest of the trip. She says: That night I went out with my friends. I didnapost want to miss out on the fun, so wore a hat and sunglasses the whole time to cover my reaction. It was only when I was in the airport two days later that I had to remove my hat and glasses for the digital facial recognition. As expected, it didnapost recognise me and I was utterly embarrassed. Thankfully, the airport security were fine and askedI was okay before letting me through.  After five days, the swelling went down and Laurenaposs face was back to normal. She explains: Luckily, I didnapost have work, so stayed at home. I was far too embarrassed for anyone to see what I looked like. With the UK now facing its hottest days of the year so far, Lauren is now urging people to be careful when spending time in the sun.  She says: Before, I always made sure to thoroughly apply sun-cream. But now, Iaposm much stricter with myself. I try to always wear SPF  sun-cream when spending time in the sun and even when itaposs not scorching hot outside, I use a moisturiser or foundation that contains it too. Iaposm now a lot more cautious about putting sun-cream on my face, because it can be an area that some people forget about. You donapost have to burn for your skin to be damaged, so people really need to be careful when spending time outside in the summer.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeHe played a hand in more than  deaths and is even said to be the Mafiaaposs deadliest ever hitman - now, heaposs free to walk the streets. Italy has erupted in fury this week after mob boss Giovanni Brusca was released early from jail, having helped prosecutors in their fight against the Sicilian Mafia group known as the Cosa Nostra. The criminal turncoat, , was given a -year reduced sentence despite horric acts that include dissolving a young boyaposs body in acid and cooking corpses over a grill. Over his bloody career, which saw him finally arrested in , Brusca waged war not just against bitter gang rivals, but also the state - notoriously assassinating the high-profile judge Giovanni Falcone. Known as aposThe Pigapos and the aposPeople Slayerapos, his release has sickened relatives still mourning the victims of his barbaric reign. Tina Montinaro, whose bodyguard husband was killed alongside Falcone, told the Republica: The state is against us - after  years we still donapost know the truth about the massacre and Giovanni Brusca, the man who destroyed my family, is free.  Natural born killer with aposlittle charismaapos Born into a long line of Mafiosa, Brusca grew up on the streets of San Giuseppe Jato, Sicily, visiting his criminal father in jail when he was just five years old. Even as a young child, he learned how to clean his fatheraposs guns and helped fugitives on the run by giving them food and clothes. By the age of , he had killed his first two victims - the second with a double-barrelled shotgun outside a cinema. Such an early penchant for bloodshed earned Brusca entry into the Mafia, serving under the powerful crime lord Salvatore Riina as he worked his way up as a hitman.  In his book The Mafia, author Al Camino describes Brusca as a ruthless butcher with little charisma. Torturing victims for information in painful half-hour sessions, he would reportedly break their legs with hammers and pull on their ears with pliers. His bloodlust appeared to have no limits. When a neighbourhood boss bizarrely asked him to kill a man seen on a certain type of tractor, Brusca saw three such vehicles pass by and killed all three drivers. On another occasion, he rushed a job because a victim was about to get married and he did not want to see the fiancee be left as a widow. Dissolved boy in acid after  days of torture Chillingly, Brusca showed little remorse, later boasting in his memoirs about his increasingly vile exploits. “I’ve dissolved bodies in acid I’ve roasted corpses on big grills I’ve buried the remains after digging graves with an earthmover,” he wrote. “Some pentiti [former Mafiosi] say today they feel disgust for what they did. I can speak for myself: I’ve never been upset by these things.”  His most stomach-churning crime came in , when the Mafia decided to take revenge against turncoat Santino di Matteo by kidnapping his -year-old son. Led by Brusca and gang leader Salvatore aposTotoapos Riina, the Cosa Nostra disguised themselves as cops, telling young Giuseppe di Matteo that they were taking him to see his father. Attempting to intimidate Santino, who was being held in police custody after agreeing to testy against the mob, the group sadistically tortured Giuseppe for nearly  days. Kept in a cafe, beaten and starved, they sent pictures of the boy to Santino, who desperately tried to negotiate his release. However, in , Brusca gave the order to get rid of the puppy and the exhausted child was strangled to death. His body was then dissolved in acid to ensure it would never be found - a practice known as aposlupara biancaapos.  Blew up anti-mob investigator on bridge The chilling murder, however, was not what brought Brusca down. By now, the man also dubbed aposThe Executionerapos and aposThe Slaughtererapos was already on the run. Four years earlier, the mobster had detonated a car bomb that killed Italyaposs leading anti-Mafia investigator, Giovanni Falcone. The legendary judge had spent his career trying to bring the mob to justice, famously bringing about the so-called ‘maxi trial’ in , which led to the conviction of  mafiosi. Brusca was instructed to seek revenge, and in  planted half a tonne of explosives under the road near Palermo as Falconeaposs car drove past. Falconeaposs we and three bodyguards were also killed in the attack, and Brusca was forced on the run. It was the capture of Santino di Matteo that later identied aposThe Pigapos as the ringleader, and sealed the fate of young Giuseppe.  Brusca was finally snared on May , . Now aged , he was caught by officials living at a small house in the Sicilian countryside near Agrigento, where he was dining with his girlfriend and their family. Incredibly, investigators tracked down the location when the noise of a plainclothes officer driving by the house on a motorbike was picked up by officers listening to a call intercepted on Bruscaaposs mobile phone. aposI cannot remember the names of the many I killedapos The following year, Brusca was sentenced to  years in prison after admitting he plotted the assassination of Falcone. The case, which remains one of Italyaposs most notorious murders, was instrumental in introducing a raft of tough anti-Mafia legislation.  Brusca, however, broke his own rules - agreeing to become a state witness to reduce his sentence. His evidence led to police tracking down a number of gangsters responsible for the Mafiaaposs crime wave across the s and s. In , he published a prison memoir in which he bragged about his sickening past, claiming to be the Mafiaaposs most prolic killer. “I killed Giovanni Falcone,” he wrote. “But it was not the first time: I had already used the car bomb to kill Judge Rocco Chinnici and the men of his escort. I am responsible for the kidnapping and death of little Giuseppe Di Matteo, who was  years old when he was kidnapped and  when he was killed. I have committed and personally ordered over  crimes. Even today I cannot remember every one, one by one, the names of those I killed. Many more than a hundred, certainly less than two hundred.” His early release this week, however, has united both the public and political parties from across the spectrum in indignation. Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League party, said: After  years in prison, the mafia boss Giovanni Brusca is a free man. This is not the aposjusticeapos that Italians deserve.

Police have arrested  people in connection with the incident after the brutal attack on the medic, identied locally as Dr Seuj Jumar Senapati, in Odali Model Hospital in Assam. The doctor was dragged down a flight of stairs as the deceased manaposs relatives hurled abuse at him, with one woman taking a sandal off to thrash him. They repeatedly whack him over his head and back as helpless Dr Senapati urges them to stop, pulling his face towards his hands to protect himself. At one point, one member of the group pulls out a large broom and starts whacking the doctor with that too. Other members of the group slap him across the face and kick him. The group then pulled Dr Senapati from the floor and marched him through a hallway while they continued to attack him. It was then that police officer nearby tried to intervene and take the medical professional to safety. But the furious group were undeterred, pulling him down a short flight of stairs and outside onto a patch of grass where he falls to the floor again. When a woman got out a sandal and began slapping the medic repeatedly he managed to slip away and rush to hospital.  The doctor said he went to check on the patient after relatives said his condition was serious, only to find that he had died. Dr Senapati said: The relatives of the patient complained that the patientaposs condition was serious. When I reached the patient, I found that he had already died. The relatives then immediately vandalised the furniture at the hospital and attacked me. The attack comes after similar footage emerged in April when  family appeared to surround a young doctor after their relative died of Covid. The group were said to have suspected the patient died from a lack of oxygen while being treated by the medic in the back of ambulance. The doctor, identied locally as -year-old Dr Siddhant Totla, had been tending to the -year-old man on the way to hospital.

The rare treasure, known as ambergris, is a highly sought-after substance used in the perfume industry. The  fishermen from southern Yemen spoke of their joy after the lucky discovery in the Gulf of Aden which lted them out of poverty.One of the men told the BBC : If you find whale ambergris itaposs a treasure.One of the fishermen from Seriah called us in the morning and he said: aposThereaposs a whale and it may contain ambergris.apos He said as they got closer to the mammal, they noticed a strong smell and had the feeling that there might be something precious in the whale.  They then took the whale to the shore to see what was inside it - and found the precious substance in its belly. The fisherman said: The smell wasnapost very nice but ... lots of money. Another man told the BBC: When we found the ambergris I felt so happy. They sold the substance .bn Yemeni rials - the equivalent of about . million- to a trader from the United Arab of Emirates.  The profits from the ambergris were ided equally among the fishermen and they also gave money to some people who needed help in the village. One fisherman said the huge amount of money also allowed some of them to buy houses or cars - and some of the men are planning to get married soon. Despite their lucky find, the men have vowed to continue fishing, with one saying: I have to keep going to sea, evenI donapost get anything. Itaposs in my blood. A fisherman told the Middle East Eye that he had never found any ambergris before.The price of ambergris ies depending on the quality and the colour of the substance, but generally it is worth around £, per kilogram. Sperm whales eat large quantities of cephalopods such as squid and cuttlefish, which have some parts that are dficult for the mammals to digest.  Most of the time they are vomited out, but sometimes they move into the whaleaposs intestines and bind together, forming a solid mass of ambergris.It is also believed that the substance protects the whaleaposs internal organs from the sharp squid beaks, according to the National History Museum.Ambergris has been called the treasure of the sea and floating gold.  Earlier this year, a woman found a huge lump of whale vomit as she walked along the beach in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand.She walked up closer to the substance to have a look and found it had a fishy smell. Thinking that it could be something she could sell, the -year-old dragged it back to her house which was around  metres away from the beach. The oval-shaped lump weighed kg and was about  inches wide and  inches long.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore

for neurodivergent fife teens who may have natural ability","story":"Teenager Max Rafferty could have a natural talent for cyber security.Experts reckon that young people with autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD could be ideal candidates for careers in the sector, where skills like cracking passwords and staying one step ahead of computer hackers are needed.That’s why Fe College offered him and a group of neuroergent pupils from Levenmouth Academy the chance to take part in a four-week taster course run by lecturers.The skills learned by -year-old Max could be put to good use in his future career in engineering, he said.“The wide range of things that you can do for cyber security interested me.“The password cracking was probably what I enjoyed the most.“We learned the dferent techniques hackers would use to crack someone’s password.”He completed the course earlier this year with five of other pupils at the Buckhaven school.Harry Brown, principal teacher of developing youth workforce, was delighted when Fe College offered the school the opportunity.He hopes it will enhance opportunities for disadvantaged pupils at the school and some of the teenagers who completed the introductory course have already expressed an interest in exploring careers in computing and cybersecurity.He said: “ is very important, particularly with the backgrounds we have here because we do come from a low socioeconomic area.“At Levenmouth we’re working a great deal with those iniduals who could have those neurological dficulties so the course that Fe College came up with was absolutely perfect.”The course was delivered by lecturers at Fe College and funded by Skills Development Scotlandand the Scottish Government under the strategic framework for a cyber resilient Scotland.A gap in support was identied by SDS and a fund was created to teach the pupils about the protection of computer systems and networks from information discourse and digital forensics.Cyber security is one industry in which these students can flourish.#Iain Haker, Fe College.After the successful delivery of the course, it is hoped the opportunity will be extended to other schools from across the Fe region.Iain Haker, assistant principal at Fe College, said lecturers wanted to do more to support neuroergent students in the kingdom.“We want to bridge the gap between school and college, and highlight the careers that might be available to them with the skills and qualities that they have.“Cybersecurity is one industry in which these students can flourish, and with the current digital skills gap in Scotland there are a lot of opportunities in this area.”Claire Gillespie, digital technologies sector skills manager at SDS, said: “It’s very important that we continue enhancing the support available so that every young person regardless of their circumstances has the opportunity to explore the fulfilling and rewarding careers available in the digital sector.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/06/2.60141042-240x180.jpg

urged people to watch out for fish in garden ponds.An SSPCA spokesperson told The Courier that an animal rescue officer had attended and searched the local area but had been unable to locate the critter.Earlier this year orphaned otter cubs were found wandering the streets of Inverkeithing.The cubs, found in February, were later taken to the Scottish SPCA#s National Wildle Rescue Centre near

You can see the Banchory Violin Trail map below. Locals can also pick up the map in all participating venues.J.G. Ross Bakery, Banchory Lodge Hotel, Copper  Grey, Scott Skinner’s Restaurant  Bar, and FOLD at The Barn are some of the venues taking part in the art and music trail.Corinne said: #We appealed for local business through Banchory Business Association to come forward and sponsor one of the artists.#They funded the artworks for the trail, which is something we#re very grateful for because a lot of the local businesses had a dficult year as well. So it was really great of them to come on board and show their support for this project.#They supported the artists, but also encouraged visitors to come to our town and explore the ious shops and cafes we have here in Banchory.#The Barn#s marketing manager Dawn Hawkins, said the arts venue was #delighted# to be part of the Banchory Violin Trail.She said: #The violin trail relates back to our local heritage, landscape and folklore and brings a sense of community with it.#It’s lovely to see a buzz about Banchory again after such a long period of lockdown.#The violin displayed in the window of FOLD is by artist Astrid Björklund.#Inspired by themes relating to local heritage, landscape, wildle as well as folklore, each violin is a unique work of art.Corrine said: #We appealed for local artists to get involved in the trail. They were given a design brief but we left the scope quite open to create a piece about what Banchory meant to them.#Beverley Black, whose violin is displayed in J.G. Ross Bakery, said: #My violin reflects the local beauty spot of  Crathes Castle which is irresistible to an artist.#I have painted it many times in all seasons and the changes through the season are depicted in the paintings on the violin.#Artist Iris Walker-Reid was inspired by old photographs and maps of Banchory Railway Station and The Deeside Line.She said: #I used the pattern from the wood of the violin as contour lines of old maps and decorated the neck with train lines to connect the strings to the railway lines. I then reflected the ornate station canopy around the sides of the violin.#Iris# violin can be seen at book store Yeadon’s of Banchory.#The artists have really embraced a erse group of topics,# said Corinne.#We hope people will come, walk around Banchory and learn more about the history. It#s a great day out for families.#After the trail has concluded on September , all  violins will be auctioned off. The funds raised will be split between the artist and the town to be used for other creative projects.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/shutterstock_1649461294-e1622460125117-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Aberdeen to a close.The former Dons and Caley Thistle midfielder led the Reds Under-s to the Development League title in -, his first season in charge.Sheerin also oversaw a run to the  Youth Cup final, which ended in defeat to Hibernian.After the dismissal of Derek McInnes in March, Sheerin took charge of the Reds first team on an interim basis and lost his sole game in the dugout - to Dundee United.The -year-old says that, while he always had the intention to manage again one day, that spell at the Pittodrie helm showed him he was ready now.He said: #I was in a brilliant job, a job I loved. But I always had that inkling that I wanted to get back# that burning desire to be on the touchline on a Saturday and week-to-week be involved in the training ground as my own man.#When the Falkirk job became available it was too big an opportunity not to have a look at. I just felt the time was right.#What I realised during that interim period at Pittodrie was that I was ready to step in again – you’re never convinced until you’re given that chance.#The circumstances weren’t the best for me to take charge at Aberdeen but it was vital for me because I’m now confident I can do the job.#Sheerin was Arbroath manager between  and , winning the Third Division before becoming boss of Aberdeen#s development side.During his seven years in the Granite City, Sheerin worked with McInnes and Tony Docherty and reckons he is all the better for that experience.👉 https:t.co RueeZmug pic WDSWRbsvYfmdash Falkirk FCMay , #I#ve been fortunate enough to work with Derek and Tonyfor seven years,# he said.#They are arguably two of the best coaches in the game so that experience will be invaluable for me going forward.#I#ll certainly be dipping into that well as time progresses.#Sheerin will reunite with former Dons youth Robbie Mutch at the Falkirk Stadium.Elgin-born Mutch, , left the Reds for the Bairns in  following a y youth career. He also had loan spells at Arbroath, Dumbarton and Deveronvale.Sheerin is looking forward to seeing how Mutch has progressed after more than  appearances in the Falkirk first team.#I enjoyed working with Robbie. He probably just fell shortand needed to go and find his way.#He#s done excellent since he left the club and has cemented his place in the first team here at Falkirk.#I#m looking forward to working with him again. I#ve spoken to him and he#ll obviously be able to liaise with players in the dressing room and let them know what kind of coach I am.#It#s handy to have a familiar face coming in.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"ding ding bowling along in round one","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then there#s the goats.Leaving the harbour car park, turn right and follow the road back up the hill for m.You will pass two minor roads on your right, the turning to Port Righ on your left.Continue until the school is on your left and immediately look for a forestry road to your right .Turn right on to the track, keeping the car park to your left. Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left.

Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead.

This also allows closer inspection of the amazing folded Dalradian rocks.Once back at the bay # where you may decide a swim is in order # head right up the track from the carpark at its eastern end.After a gate you will be in fields which may have livestock. Veer sharp left at the other side of the first field and follow the track to another gate out on to a lane.Head straight ahead toto Carradale village and the main road. Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"summer in the garden roses and relaxing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Dunchraigaig Cairn, are the earliest known in Scotland and the first clear examples of deer carvings from the Neolithic to Early Bronze Age in the whole of the UK.This is also the first time ancient animal carvings have been discovered alongside cup and ring markings in the UK.Discovery of the , to ,-year-old artwork shatters long-held perceptions about prehistoric cultures and adds to the reputation of Kilmartin Glen as a site of global signicance.The carvings were discovered by chance by Oxfordshire man Hamish Fenton, who has a background in archaeology, while visiting Kilmartin Glen.The carvings are located inside the cairn on the capstone of an Early Bronze Age burial cist.Kilmartin Glen has one of the most important concentrations of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in Scotland, including some of the finest cup and ring markings in the country.Dr Tertia Barnett, principal investigator for Scotland’s Rock Art Project at Historic Environment Scotland , said: #It was previously thought that prehistoric animal carvings of this date didn’t exist in Scotland, although they are known in parts of Europe, so it is very exciting that they have now been discovered here for the first time in the historic Kilmartin Glen.#This extremely rare discovery completely changes the assumption that prehistoric rock art in Britain was mainly geometric and non-figurative.#While there are a few prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, the only other ones created in the Early Bronze Age are very schematic.#It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig Cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent.#This also tells us that the local communities were carving animals as well as cup and ring mots which is in keeping with what we know of other Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, particularly in Scandinavia and Iberia.#Until now, we did not know of any area in Britain with both types of carvings, which poses questions about the relationship between them and their signicance to the people that created them.#Following Hamish’s discovery, experts from Scotland’s Rock Art Project examined the carvings to confirm their authenticity.This included utilising innovative technology in their analysis.A structured light scan was carried out by HES digital documentation experts to create an accurate and detailed D model with photographic texture, and ious visualisation techniques were then applied to the model in order to reveal more details of the carvings than would have been visible to the naked eye.Dr Barnett added: #Digital techniques are being used more and more frequently to create precise D models of rock art and reveal details that were previously unknown to us, or that we only suspected.#Digital technology is becoming increasingly important for archaeology, and particularly for rock art, and is a key to unlocking the hidden secrets of our past.#This incredible discovery in Dunchraigaig Cairn makes us wonderother animal carvings previously unknown to the UK are hidden in unexpected places in our ancient landscapes, waiting to be uncovered in the future.#The cairn, which is in care of HES, is m wide and contained three stone burial chambers, or cists.The third cist, where the carvings are located, was dug directly into the ground, lined with drystone cobbled walls and capped with an unusually large stone over .m long.The remains of up to  iniduals, some cremated, were also discovered here when the site was initially excavated in the s, as well as artefacts including a whetstone, a greenstone axe and a flint kne.Hamish Fenton said: #I was passing Dunchraigaig Cairn at dusk when I noticed the burial chamber in the side of the cairn and decided to slide inside with my torch.#As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn’t appear to be natural markings in the rock.#As I shone the light around further, I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock.#This was a completely amazing and unexpected find and, to me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past.#The cairn is currently closed while HES carries out further evaluation and puts measures in place to protect the extremely rare, and delicate, ancient carvings.Kilmartin Museum curator Dr Sharon Webb MBE said: #The archaeology of Kilmartin Glen is extraordinary, and every new discovery adds to its international importance.#Future research will help us to understand how this amazing and unique art fits into the story of the glen, which is really exciting.#We’re in the process of rebuilding the museum with a £. million redevelopment and we’ll be including interpretations of this rock art in the new exhibitions when they open in .#PICS:Deer antlers can be seen carved into the rock.

minorities in the royal workforce in documents unearthed by thenewspaper.The paper also outlined how in the late s civil servants and senior figures from Government negotiated with royal aides an exemption for the Queen and the household from legislation designed to prevent race discrimination.A Buckingham Palace spokesman stressed the Queen and the household comply with the present Equality Act ldquoin principle and in practice, adding: ldquoClaims based on a second-hand account of conversations from over  years ago should not be used to draw or infer conclusions about modern-day events or operations.A Home Office civil servant, TG Weiler, writing in February  summarised a meeting with Lord Tyron, then the Queenrsquos most senior financial manager, his deputy and their legal adviser in documents relating to the  Race Relations Act.The Whitehall official reported the palace aides as suggesting the Queenrsquos household fell ldquointo three categoriessenior posts, which were not filled by advertising or by any overt system of appointment and which would presumably be accepted as outside the scope of the billclerical and other office posts, to which it was not, in fact, the practice to appoint coloured immigrants or foreigners andordinary domestic posts for which coloured applicants were freely considered, but which would in any event be covered by the proposed general exemption for domestic employment.Mr Weiler went on to say: ldquoThey were particularly concerned, however, thatthe proposed legislation applied to the Queenrsquos household it would for the first time make it legally possible to criticise the household.ldquoMany people do so already, but this has to be accepted and is on a dferent footing from a statutory provision.The legislation was passed after an exemption was agreed which meant the Race Relations Board dealt with allegations of racial discrimination made by members of the royal household rather than the courts.reported an exemption still remains in place under the  Equality Act which replaced the  Race Relations Act, the  Sex Discrimination Act and the  Equal Pay Act.The newspaperrsquos reporting stems from documents it has

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.

It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.

If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judges# attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the #person in the shadows#.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, said: #Every year this competition attracts a huge number of high quality entries from learners across Scotland, and it is an honour that our young people made it to the final.#These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I#m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many, many years and we#re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#Gaelic education is offered in more than  of our primary schools and five secondary schools.#There has been an increase in interest in Gaelic Medium Education, which will have a positive impact on future generations of Gaelic speakers.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"author meyrick moves into gangland territory","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These animals are easily adaptable to a iety of habitats: from meadows to woods to city streets. They can also survive on a wide range of food, such as small mammals, invertebrates and fruit, but they will take advantage of food discarded by people.Foxes are social animals who live in small groups that consist of a breeding male , a femaleand their cubs. Usually, the male and female bond for le but there will be occasions when the male may seek additional mating opportunities.Mating takes place in winter and this is when foxes are most vocal. If you happen to have a window open on a winter night and you hear a loud screaming noise that sounds like a high-pitched screech, it is most definitely a fox looking for a mate and fending off its rivals.In spring, females give birth to several cubs, which become fully self-sufficient by autumn when they leave their parents. Some cubs may decide to stay with their family and they will play a big part in raising the following yearrsquos litter.My adventure with foxes started not that long ago. I was always fascinated by them but never really happened to photograph them. Occasionally, I was lucky to catch a glimpse of a fox but usually it was late in the evening or in a dense woodland, where photo opportunities are low.At the beginning of this year, I promised myself that I would find a family of foxes and get some decent shots. You may not believe it, but I spent weeks studying Google Maps in search of the best spots in East Lothian that I would visit everything marked green or looking like an open space was in scope for investigation.As spring progressed, I started to become more and more lucky with foxes. I reached the point when I could see them almost each time I left the house. I have taken multiple images, but I was never happy with them, until one dayhellipIt was a sunny Saturday morning when I decided to go out and look for deer. I visited a local meadow and quickly spotted a roe deer buck which I decided to follow. I did not manage to take any photos of the deer because as soon as I rushed after him, a beautully coloured fox crossed my path. Every day thenceforth I was coming back home with more information about the fox that I found. Finally, I was rewarded with some lovely shots in the setting sun! This is something I was dreaming of for so long! These animals are fantastic and I have completely fallen for them .Now, with lockdown eased, I hope you will have a chance to spend more time outdoors and hopefully see some lovely foxes. Evenyou donrsquot spot them on your walk, donrsquot give up! Look for some signs which may indicate of their presence: fox pooor their underground burrow .Scats are usually easily identiable as they are twisted and contain bits of fur and bones. They are deposited at prominent spots such as on footpaths, stumps, posts or rocks. The den is nothing  but a circular hollow in the groundyou are brave enough to lower yourself and snf it, you will smell a strong and unpleasant scent. Foxes secrete this smelly odour to mark their territories but it also helps to distinguish iniduals . They also have scent glands on their feet, so they mark their well-used trails as they walk ndash this is quite helpful to effectively navigate at night.If you would like to share your fox sightings with me or advise about good photography spots, please get in touch. I will also be delighted to chat anything wildle, so please do come up to say helloyou see me out and about with my camera.Speak to you next month!www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww.instagram zans_lenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-lodged-crematorium-near-musselburgh","story":"East Lothian Council will now consider the project from the Westerleigh Group, a developer and operator of crematoria and cemeteries, with  facilities in England, Scotland and Wales.A single-storey crematorium, of around m internally, which would house a -seat chapel, is planned in the larger of two fields on the site.There would be a waiting room, accessible toilets, administration office, crematory, covered walkway and floral tribute area.Car parking providing  spaces, including six disabled accessible bays and an additional four spaces for staff parking, and memorial gardens are also planned.George Bell, regional manager for north and east from Westerleigh Group, said: \"There is a pressing need for a crematorium in East Lothian.\"East Lothian does not have a crematorium of their own and their residents currently have to travel long journeys into Edinburgh, through busy roads, to access a crematorium.\"The area already has a large population base and this is going to grow further in the coming years, with some signicant new housing developments being planned.\"If our planning application is successful, this new crematorium will also serve the wider Edinburgh City region.\"We pride ourselves on creating and maintaining crematoria which are welcoming, attractive places for remembrance and reflection, and which are true assets to their local communities.\"The teams at all our crematoria have proudly earned a reputation for providing exceptional care and support to local people, enabling families to remember, mourn and celebrate the lives of their loved ones in a way that is uniquely personal, and we look forward to hopefully being able to bring that same high level of service to the people of East Lothian.\"Earlier this year, we conducted a public consultation exercise and were delighted to receive a positive response.\"The full planning application has now been submitted and we hope to receive a decision in early autumn.\"The site of the proposed development is around  acres, located north of the village of Old Craighall.

And leaving the scarf, that wasnrsquot part of the plan either.Doubts and anxiety about the trip once again surfaced in Izzyrsquos mind. It had been so carefully planned to keep Finn safe, but now it seemed to be unravelling. The incident at Bridge of Orchy had unnerved Izzy to the extent she was no longer sure she could trust Ewen to keep to the arrangements they had painstakingly put together.The more she thought about it, the more she began to realise that ending the trip and taking Finn home would be the safest thing to do.But her mind was torn in a dilemma. She could see he was enjoying and benefitting from the adventure. As shersquod hoped, the landscape, the stories and immersion in nature had created a new emotional space for Finn. The Highlands were working their magic and Finn was slowly opening up his anxiety seemed less and he was managing his anger better. His regular calls to his mum were vital to maintain this, but there were signs that this trip, as Izzy had hoped, could be a seed for healing.And, besides, Finn had already made it clear he didnrsquot want the journey cut short. If she did so now, how could she explain her decision to him  She would have to make something up and he would feel so let down, probably assume he was to blame.As Izzy drove over the bridge, her mind swirled with indecision. She reached the junction with the main road, then hesitated. Head north to Rannoch Moor, or south and take Finn home  It was late afternoon now, with perhaps three hours of daylight left.ldquoCome on aunty, there are no cars, you can go.Izzy made her decision: she turned left and headed north.A distant view of the Caledonian wood was suddenly blocked by a dense plantation of Sitka spruce by the road. Then Loch Tulla reappeared into view, its banks littered with naturersquos debris, landed there during previous flooding by the loch.Before they began their ascent to Rannoch Moor, they passed the ruined castle at Achallader. Its tower was clearly visible in the distance, a jagged tooth standing defiantly but dwarfed by the mountains beyond.It was yet another fortress built by Black Duncan, this time on land taken from the Fletchers, so the story goes, by devious means. The conniving Campbell chief engineered a deadly confrontation between one of his servants and the head of the Fletchers. The sad result was the murder of the servant by the Fletcher, all part of Black Duncanrsquos plan. It was done in the heat of the moment, but murder it was, and Fletcher would hang for itcaught and tried. Duncan ensured he himself was witness to the incident, so he had Fletcherrsquos fate in his palm. So upon Duncanrsquos advice, the Fletchers fled, leaving the land to be acquired by the cunning Campbell chief, who promptly had a tower built by the farm to mark his possession of it.ldquoJust like a dog pees on lampposts to mark his territory, commented Finn.ldquoWhat an image, but yes! laughed Izzy. ldquoAnd it guards the edge of his Campbell estate, as well as the droversrsquo route. From here, we climb up to Rannoch Moor.The road curved as it climbed to give a spectacular view over Loch Tulla and the peaks of the great wall of Rannoch, a mountain boundary on the south of the moor. Izzy had travelled this way many times, but her anticipation was undiminished: Rannoch Moor is a wild place seeped in legend and history, not a few ghosts, and an unpredictable temper.Izzy pulled up at a layby on the edge of the moor and turned to look at her nephew.ldquoWersquore going on a walk, arenrsquot we  he said despondently. He looked around. It was all empty moorland with distant mountains. ldquoWe are in the middle of nowhere, aunty, what are we going to see ldquoI will be honest, Finn, itrsquos not far but it may be boggy and wet underfoot. But itrsquos a place of special meaning for me and I really want to share it with you.He looked down at his boots, then gave her an affirmative smile.ldquoOK then, I suppose so far I havenrsquot regretted going on your lsquoshortrsquo walkshellip much!They set off onto the moor but kept not far from the road. They leapt between mounds of wispy grass and bog myrtle, trying with limited success to avoid boggy areas. Soon Finn could see what he guessed was their destination: a large boulder with a tree growing from the top of it.It was a lsquogiantrsquos stonersquo but not as large as Samsonrsquos Putting Stone. Izzy climbed to the top with an ease that suggested shersquod done it before and gave Finn a hand up. They both sat under the branches of the tree, a small weather-beaten rowan, looking out to the mountains which they had passed on their journey. Cars whizzed by on the nearby road, but soon Finn became unaware of their fleeting presence as he listened to his auntrsquos words.ldquoHow it seeded in this unlikely place, I canrsquot say, she said. ldquoPerhaps a careless bird dropped a berry and couldnrsquot retrieve it. But however the seed arrived, it sprouted and grew from this small crack on the boulderrsquos summit. This tree survives on meagre ground and in an exposed position, howling winds have bent its spines. Irsquove seen it in all seasons, resplendent with berries in autumn, battered by freezing winter gales, its naked branches turned white by frost, wearing a coat of blossom in spring. Its le here seems impossible, yet it survives. Each time I pass on tour, I slow my coach and say hello under my breath. But when I am on a personal journey, I often stop and keep it company for a while.ldquoKeep it company aunty, really ldquoItrsquos alone, Finn. Trees connect with each other just as humans do, although in dferent ways of course. They crave the company of their kind, their roots intertwine as we might give each other hugs. But this beautul tree is lonesome.ldquoI donrsquot think trees get lonely, aunty, they donrsquot have feelings like we do.Izzy bent her knees up to her chin and wrapped her arms around her legs, staying silent in thought for a moment before replying.ldquoMaybe yoursquore right, Finn, perhaps itrsquos that trees can help us recognise our own feelings. You know, when we see their struggles, they remind us of our own. They are living things too and I think they can understand.Finn peered up at the tree. A few red berries hung from its wilted branches. From a distance, it had looked defiant, but close up it looked, well, precarious perhaps even anxious, clinging onto its almost bare rock for survival. He didnrsquot want to admit it out loud, but he did understand what his aunt was saying he too could feel a connection to the rowanrsquos struggle.As they sat either side of the tree squeezed on top of the boulder, Izzy told a story. Finn wasnrsquot sureit was for him or the tree probably both, he reckoned. It was a story he would long remember, more deeply than he could have imagined he would.They walked back to the car silently, carefully re-treading their steps to avoid sinking ankle deep in bog. Midges buzzed in the air but didnrsquot bother. It was getting very cool and breezy darkening clouds were making the sky seem angry.ldquoThe mood of the moor is changing, reflected Izzy out loud. ldquoYou ready to see what lies beyond that ridge Here are the links to chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, , , , ,  and ."},{"url":null,"title":"alcohol-seized-youths-drinking-hotspots-dunbar","story":"Reports of underage drinking at Lochend Woods and John Muir Country Park have been passed to police.Constable Chris Hutchison, from the Dunbar Community Policing Team, updated members of the townrsquos community council in a written report.He said: ldquoThese areas continued to be patrolled on foot, bike and vehicle by local officers, which has led to seizures of alcohol from youths.

People inidually can make a big dference to the species on their doorstep, but also need to take collective action to help bring our wildle back.\"Encourage neighbours\"The key is to share enthusiasm and what everyone can enjoyyou all work together. As a charity we have been trying to do more landscape-scale conservation where more people work together. If people are inspired by people they know and live near, its really powerful,\" says Jelley.Share experiences\"We moved into our house in November, put in a trail camera and discovered we had a hedgehog in our garden and I started having a conversation with the neighbours, asking themthey had hedgehogs in their garden.\"A hedgehog moves through quite a large area when its feeding, so it needs access to gardens. One of the challenges is that a lot of gardens are fenced or have a wall, so hedgehogs cant access the gardens so easily,\" he says.\"Talk to neighbours to seethey can help create a corridor by cutting a small hole in the bottom of their garden fence. Then the neighbour can share stories of what the hedgehog was doing in their garden and it starts to feel like its a community pet, with shared responsibility for looking after its welfare.\"Connect through social media\"There is a  Days Wild Facebook group which is a great example of how people from all walks of le share their experiences of wildle, ask for help in identying something, or support each other with practical ideas on how to make space for nature,\" explains Jelley.\"Technology is a brilliant way of recording wildle, but its also a brilliant way of celebrating it. There are loads of dferent groups on social media s who are sharing stories of what theyve encountered and asking questions about species.\"Join or set up a community group\"If you have a shared community green space within an urban area, there is an opportunity to influence that to help wildle,\" he notes. \"We work with social housing providers to help them manage their land. Often these providers will engage the residents that live there and ask them what theyd like to see - to accommodate what is good for wildle, but is also interesting for people.\"You might get involved in creating a wildflower meadow. It doesnt have to be a huge field. You can create a wildflower meadow in a raised bed or a pot or at the side of a shrubbery.\"You can get all generations involved too. The charity suggests recording some older community members talking about their most treasured wild memories as part of a wild time capsule project.Create neighbourhood competitionsChallenge the next village along to build the best bug hotel, for instance, the charity suggests.Think about doing less\"Sometimes with wildle, its actually about doing less. If youre cutting back verges or hedges less often, you are providing more natural conditions for wildle. Engage with decision-makers and people who manage the green space around you, which is a powerful community influence.\"Donate wildle-friendly gtsDonate nest boxes to a local school, business or care home, which will not only give the recipients a connection to nature, but encourage neighbours and friends to do the same, to cast the natural network wider, The Wildle Trusts suggests.Learn from allotment holders\"[Allotments] are fantastic places for wildle. They are a leline for species like slow worms and other reptiles that rely on compost heaps and the conditions allotments provide,\" says Jelley.\"Allotment holders are often very knowledgeable about the need for bees and butterflies, to grow the crops they are trying to grow.\"Access specialist groups\"There are specialist groups around the country for all sorts of dferent things. The Wildle Trusts can help signpost people to them. If people dont know where to start, contact your local wildle trust to find out whats happening in your area,\" says Jelley.\"The local trusts will often be running activities and events, but are also the facilitators of more specialist groups, such as those who are interested in bats or dragonflies or whatever. They are keen to pass on that knowledge and to help newcomers learn about stuff on a basic level.\"For more ideas and to join in the fun at  Days Wild visit wildletrusts.org DaysWild."},{"url":null,"title":"food-learn-make-vietnamese-food-scratch-home","story":"Food: Learn how to make Vietnamese food from scratch at homeVietnamese: Simple Vietnamese Food to Cook at Home by Uyen Luu The first pancake is always a dud. It doesnt matter how smooth your batter, how hot and Teflonned your pan the debut is always a crumpled mess that flops sadly onto the plate.This is true whether its an English pancake destined for lemon or sugar, or, as in this case, a turmeric-spiked rice flour and coconut milk crepe, laden with plump prawns and a forest floors worth of coriander. Impaled by rogue bean sprouts and soggy rather than crisp, I have utterly massacred food writer Uyen Luus sizzling crepes. I hope she will forgive me.I order in Vietnamese food every chance I get: fragrant chicken phocoarsely shredded papaya salads golden spring rolls and enticingly translucent summer ones pork-prawn wontons with sesame and chilli oil chargrilled, fish sauce-drenched aubergines... but until now, Id never attempted to cook it myself.Why even try when the depth of flavour seems unfathomable to achieve  When every dish is so zingy and bold, fresh and sprightly  Who has such lightness of touch  Luu, thats who. And me, it turns out, when armed with Luus new recipe collection, Vietnamese.The dishes in the brilliantly blush pink cookbook are designed to \"demysty Vietnamese cooking\", promises Luu, who reckons the most common mistake people make when approaching the cuisine, is \"they think its more complicated than it is\".You cant really blame themwhen the \"flavours feel and taste complex\". However, to hit those key Vietnamese flavours - sweet, sour, salty, umami, hot and bitter - its just a matter of combining ingredients, Luu insists. Theres no need to be intimidated.I start off slow with the stir-fried greens a tangle of noodles, shards of pak choi and a sauce I didnt even have to go shopping for . It took literally  minutes to throw together, and the Thai basil I did go out and buy especially, was fully worth the trip .The ginger chicken I try next proves to be an alchemical triumph of caramelised brown sugar, chicken thighs and a hefty scattering of fresh ginger matchsticks. I grow sceptical when told to add a full teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper to the bubbling panbut am an idiot to argue. It brings warmth and depth and almost tricks you into forgetting that really, its the fish sauce you should be applauding, because thats the umami deliciousness holding everything together.We crunch through spears of asparagus and broccoli on the side, a sign of Luus insistence to make things work for you. She just species \"greens\" - whatever greens youve got will do perfectly. Hence why my dodgy first crepe is folded scrappily into shells of iceberg and baby cos lettuce, and although I have a few strands of Thai basil left, and a little coriander and mint, I bump it up with chervil from a pot on the balcony too. Greenery of all kinds welcome.We eat the lettuce-wrapped crepes in shts, dunking them in a piquant fish sauce that runs down your wrists. They get crispier and crispier as I get more patientand the pan itself gets hotter and hotter, until the crepes crackle when they hit the plate. The piles of herbs, abundance of prawns and the elegance of the fish sauce in a blue and white china bowl, make this crepe supper feel special, memorable, but also achievable. And thats the crux - Luu wants us to feel confident making these dishes,not every night of the week, at least once or twice.As a general rule, the dishes we cook at home on autopilot are the ones we grew up eating. Ask chefs, food writers and home cooks, Who taught you to cook , and we almost always invoke grandmothers, nonnas, abuelas. Being a child, having a tea towel pegged to your top and a wooden spoon put in your hand by an elder, is practically universal.They can hold the keys to our culinary heritage in a way parents - too close, too busy - tend not to. For many of us, its our grandmothers recipes we long to record, and that we miss most desperately when we realise were grown up and have our own kitchens to use. Straying outside the culinary remits of our grandmothers can be dficult.My childhood was caullower bakes, spaghetti Bolognese , Chinese takeaways on Fridaysand roasts on Sundays. My Granny made treacle tarts and elderflower cordial, bundt cakes, baked potatoes with boiled eggs, and chicken nugget bagels with peas and corn.And yet, as I prepare Luus ginger chicken, and watch long strands of spring onion curl and twist as theyre submerged in a bowl of icy water, they make me think of my Granny anyway, and how shed use scissors to turn s of shiny wrapping paper ribbons into cascading spirals.It turns out the act of learning something new, grasping unfamiliar methods and skills, or mastering a flavour combination that once seemed daunting, can make your brain turn to the person who taught you the first things, way back in the beginning.Vietnamese: Simple Vietnamese Food To Cook At Home by Uyen Luu is published by Hardie Grant, priced pound.

Responding to an initial written question, a Minister would read out a turgid civil service response, then subside gratefully, hoping for a y supplementary to catch his breath.Up from the Labour side would bound Tam, to declare in his sonorous Etonian tones: ldquoHow much  Or, even better: ldquoWhy  Cue startled Minister.I thought of Tam when I pondered the question of a putative co-operation deal between the SNP Scottish Government and the Greens. Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

Given that working from home suddenly became a necessity last year though, I wonder how many of us who work in offices now find them a much more appealing place to be Over the last  years I have seen many changes in working environments but none so dramatic as those brought about by the pandemic. We all found new ways to work, and quickly: using our laptops on our kitchen table, or balancing them on our knees, became an everyday reality, as did video calls. For many, the lack of a commute, comfort of home and access to the kettle was refreshing ndash initially.However, as the months rolled by I have spoken to an increasing number of people who have felt isolated, in spite of technology, and are eager for the physical connection with colleagues again. There is no doubt that the virtual world cannot compensate for real interaction.Interestingly, as peopleto offices, not only do employees and employers want toto work in a safe and controlled way, there is also a recognition that this is a chance to consider new ways of redesigning space. People, it seems, are no longer prepared to sit at a desk all day.In my industry I am seeing a demand for introducing and integrating more social, relaxed, settings and by that I mean work cafes or breakout areas. Staff are being given options about how best to collaborate with colleagues while making sure the work still gets done.Itrsquos a dferent working dynamic which takes into account awareness of physical distancing. Whereas in times gone by some employers might have wanted to fit as many people as possible into a space, there is now a desire for distance and movement. Doing away with rigidity physically seems, in my experience, to have the same impact on peoplersquos thinking.Itrsquos taken a long time for businesses to recognise that the environments they create contribute hugely to motivation, mental health and well-being. Now, more than ever, there is a desire to make going back to the office an attractive option.There is no doubt that brainstorming works best in a shared space like an office where we can bounce ideas off one another. I donrsquot think Irsquom alone in becoming keenly aware of the energy that just being around people generates, as well as the sense of community and common purpose.That said, remote working is here to stay and the value of video calls, particularly when it comes to the climate considerations, cannot be underestimated.

Without some trusted points on the map, wersquoll be lost in a confusion of our own making.There seems to be five areas of agreement starting to establish themselves. They appear to break down as follows:, Tory \"disrespect\" has fuelled independence supportThe word \"disrespect\" will likely alienate those of unionist bent, but itrsquos dficult to argue that Brexit, and the lack of consideration for the majority of Scottish public opinion, wasnrsquot a smack in the face. The Union is meant to be a matter of consent, not coercion.To save unionist supporters taking offence at the word \"disrespect\", letrsquos say instead that the Tory Government \"failed to consider and act upon\" the majority of Scottish public opinion. A wrong can be done passively as well as actively. Negligence can be wounding.Couple this disrespect ndash negligenceyou prefer ndash with the dismissal by Boris Johnsonrsquos Government of the Scottish election presenting a democratic mandate for a second referendum and the sense that Scotland is being \"controlled\" against its will becomes ever greater., The case for independence needs remadeIf we accept that Mr Johnsonrsquos Government has changed the nature of the Union from consent to control, and that a mandate for a second referendum exists, then surely there should be a refreshed independence prospectus. The case for independence hasnrsquot been adequately updated since Brexit.Brexit clearly increased independence support but it also changed the nature of what independence means. Before Brexit, there was no question of a hard border with England, now that prospect is real.: SNP must tell Scotland what independence meansNor has the economic case been improved. Support may hover around  per cent but in the polling stations much of that support could evaporatethe Yes movement ndash and the SNP in particular, given itrsquos effectively subsumed much of the Yes movement ndash doesnrsquot address hard economics. Currency, the cost of separation, the isions of the marital assets and debts, pensions, EU re-entry and the euro ndash the list of unanswered economic questions goes on.While itrsquos the economy which will make up most peoplersquos minds, the other great unanswered questions hover like Banquorsquos ghost too: Nato, Trident, the military, the intelligence services.The SNPrsquos \"independence taskforce\" is shambolic. Established with the intention of \"firing up\" the Yes movement, itrsquos a Potemkin village. The taskforce head, former SNP minister Marco Biagi, has quit, reportedly because the role was the ldquoworst job ever. The SNP remains riven with toxic internal feuds ndash more proof,it were needed, that entrusting a project like independence to one self-interested political party is both dangerous and absurd., If independence fails again, it fails foreverTherersquos a sense that Mr Johnson will relent at some point ndash probably when he sees Yes sliding in the polls ndash and grant a referendum. If he does, andthe case for independence hasnrsquot been well made, especially amid such clear goading by Mr Johnsonrsquos administration, then itrsquos all over for at least a generation. Veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart warned much the same at the weekend. If the Yes movement fights and loses indyref, independence will retreat to the sidelines, becoming a minority sport. Thatrsquoll spell disaster for the SNP ndash what would be the point of the party any longer  Nor could the SNP continue to use its constant sleight of hand to distract voters from its many failings in office by pointing at wicked Westminster., Le inside this \"new\" Union will be toughWhether or not another referendum is fought and lost by the Yes movement, itrsquos clear Scotland faces le inside a very dferent Union. If we agree that London is now exercising much less consideration towards \"Scottish views\", then that will only ramp up in the wake of a failed indyref. Holyrood will increasingly be told what to do, or perhaps more what not to do.Therersquos a hint of that tougher future in the looming Supreme Court hearings over whether Scotland has the authority to issue certain types of legislation. Two bills, incorporating the UN Rights of the Child and the European Charter of Local Self-Government, are to be scrutinised in court over whether they overreach Holyroodrsquos powers. The UK Government has also \"ordered\" Scotland to inform London of all contact with the EU. Expect more of the same., The Tory Government will get nasty with ScotlandMr Johnson isnrsquot going to be gentle with Scotland. Hersquos not David Cameron. Mr Johnsonrsquos \"muscular unionism\" intends to put Scotland in its place. The English electorate, broadly, and Tory voters in particular arenrsquot in an especially loving mood towards Scotland. They probably want to see a little hardball with Edinburgh.If a second referendum does materialise, then discussions over the shape of that vote wonrsquot be the cosy chit-chat that lead up to , theyrsquoll be brutal. If a Yes vote happened, prepare for horror-show negotiations as the UK tries to hammer Scotland into submission.So le either in or out of the Union will become very dferent politically from what wersquove known.: Indyref refusal will sign the death warrant of the UnionHere then are perhaps a few points on the map we can agree on: Mr Johnsonrsquos new-style Tory Party has driven support for independence, yet the case for independence has been insufficiently made and needs updating. If we do get another referendum and therersquos a No vote, itrsquos all over probably for a generation. No matter what happens in terms of Scotlandrsquos constitutional future with England, the relationship with London has changed from one of consent to control, and it looks certain Westminster will be much tougher with Scotland than before.Itrsquos not much of a map ndash butwe agree on those points, we can at least try to navigate our way towards the future in a meaningful, informed fashion.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Itrsquos not a done deal.With the collapse of the old unionist parties, Scottish identity is undoubtedly on the march. But as he points out: wersquove been here before in the last  years, and the Union has endured.As it evolved in the th Ccentury, after the abortive Jacobite Risings, the UK gave considerable space for the expression of Scottish identity ndash initially in the form of the Kirk, law and education and latterly as a key component of ldquoGreat Britain. As Sir Tom points out, Scotland was never ldquoannexed by conquest, like Wales or Ireland. Scots did not feel like a subject people in the Union, though they often found plenty to complain about.The Union was not about extinguishing or subsuming the Scottish nation ndash it was really about enriching it. Scotland was offered a partnership in the exploitation of the colonies and free trade, which it seized with enthusiasm. Not only did Scots not feel oppressed, they did a bit of oppressing on their own account in the colonies. Scots effectively ran the Empire while the English elites collected most of the profits. The Union was massively popular in Scotland, especially in the th Century.: Nicola Sturgeon is kidding about indyref and voters will soon twigWhat this means, I think, is that the economic case for independence has always assumed much greater signicance here than identity. When Ireland finally became an independent republic in , the people celebrating in Dublin streets werenrsquot worrying about what currency theyrsquod use. Similarly, when the Baltic states won independence from the ruins of the Soviet Empire there was little debate about economics. No one in Lithuania sang songs about equalisation formulae.Independence movements in Slovakia and Slovenia werenrsquot bothered about pension entitlements. They were reviving national cultures that had been crushed by successive empires for nearly  years. This partly explains a country like Slovakiarsquos enthusiasm for the European Union. Brussels guaranteed its national and cultural autonomy. EU membership secured borders, even as Slovakiarsquos economy was arguably annexed by Germany.Scotland was never in this situation. Its national border was never in doubt its culture never erased. Indeed, most Scots were happy with their relatively privileged place in the British Empire. Scottish identity became part and parcel of the Union ndash especially on the battlefield, where Scots thrived. The Victorian elites fell in love with the whole romance of Scotland ndash its mountains, its rugged inidualism, its martial culture embodied in the Scottish regiments. This was summed up by the kilt, a garment famously designed by a London tailor which became the defining sartorial expression of Scottishness.As recently as the s, Scots voted overwhelmingly Tory Unionist. Gradually, of course, in the later th century, the economic underpinnings of the Union crumbled. The Empire is gone now, along with Scotlandrsquos heavy industry. Scots began to reassess their place in the UK ndash especially after the North Sea oil bonanza and Thatcherism. But initially at least, they were seeking a new relationship with, not the extinction of, the UKIn the s, Scots restored a large degree of political autonomy, in the shape of the Scottish Parliament. Scotland is restoring by degrees economic autonomy. But so far this has remained within the context of the UK. It is not at all clear that they are even now ready to give it up.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe  referendum offered independence without tears. In fact it wasnrsquot really independence, in my view, but a form of confederalism. Scotland would have retained the pound, and no one needed to worry about a hard border because it was assumed Scotland and England would remain within the EU single market. Thatrsquos all changed since Brexit.Independence now meansseparation from the Union, not a renegotiation of it. The SNP hasnrsquot begun to address this radical discontinuity.As the anger over Brexit fades, and the Northern Ireland protocol reminds Scots just how troublesome borders can be, the SNP needs to remake the case for independence from the ground up. The Scottish Government needs an economic prospectus more compelling than anything the Union can offer. Jeering at Boris Johnson and complaining about English tourists is not enough.My only real disagreement with Sir Tom is on his suggestion that Mr Johnson is ldquomore right wing than Margaret Thatcher. That is hard to justy. She was a free market ideologue and would never have agreed to the expansion of the state that Boris Johnson has embarked upon. Mr Johnson is an interventionist. Brexit aside, hersquos more like Michael Heseltine than ldquothat bloody woman as Mrs Thatcher was often called on the doorsteps. Scots loathing of Mr Johnson is almost palpable right now. But they will eventually realise that he is not Thatcher reincarnate.Sir Tom wisely points out that the SNPrsquos rise has been very recent and was not inevitable. As recently as , the SNP was going backwards under the leadership of John Swinney. Its extraordinary rise was largely down to Alex Salmond after hisin . He delivered the narrow SNP victory of , the landslide of  and the  referendum. There is no one in the SNP now possessing that kind of populist genius.Mr Salmond was greatly assisted by the mistakes made by Labour, who had delivered devolution only to turn Holyrood into a repository of mediocrity.

The period between the Scottish referendum in  up to the start of the pandemic have been wasted years when so much could have been done to present the case and answer questions. I can see no point in holding a referendum until the case has been advanced. Boris Johnson may strike early by offering a referendum he thinks he can win, andhe does it will probably be ldquoane end of ane auld sang ndash again, quoting the Earl of Seafield in .Le could indeed be toughthe unionists win a referendum, in the sense that those Scottish institutions and others which threaten the Union will be hastily dismantled or rendered powerless so that there can never be a repeat, and this would not be unexpected. Unfortunately that would place Scotland in a more disadvantageous position than pre-devolution when at least some of our institutions and ways of le had survived. Under renewed threat within the Union, those who cherish Scotland will have lost more than a referendum.If Scotland votes for independence Mr Mackay says the UK will play hardball at the negotiating table but he underestimates the cards Scotland holds, the cards that make the UK so desperately want to hold on to us in the first place. Sitting on the Scottish side of the table, and it cannot just be the SNP but must include others, the first cards are turned over ndash Trident, fishing, oil, gas, water, whisky, green energy. The next card, our strategic geographic location in the North Atlantic ndash does Nato really want its northern back door left wide open by refusing us membership, Trident or not  The next card, the most important one, is our sharing card, the one which says we want to share with the rest of the UK and continue with many of our common interests but now as an equal. Nine cards played and no Jokers used.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.AREAS WHERE WE CAN AGREEI WAS encouraged to read that Neil Mackay had identied five areas of agreement with regard to the constitutional question of indyref. However, I was quickly disappointed when I discovered that all five points related matters of attitude or expectation.We, and in particular those in favour of independence, need to focus on practicalities. I therefore offer five points upon which there might be some agreement.First, the negotiation period will take far longer than the  months outlined in  and the transition period will be even longer.Secondly, Scotland, upon achieving independence, will not be a member of the European Union. Consequently there will initially be no hard border between Scotland and England . During the transition period it is likely that the position will change as Scotland makes its own arrangements with Europe.Thirdly, the monarchy will remain and the current Union Flag would still fly over Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse when the monarch is in residence. The flag will represent the monarchrsquos personal union of the crowns as it was between  and .Fourthly, Scotland will have full tax-raising powers. Collection of these taxes might be an issue and double taxation will be a matter that will have to be resolved.Fthly, Scotland will not invest in Trident. Westminsterwill have to make other arrangements.In addition to the above there are many areas of equal or even greater importance on which there is no clear agreement. All of these matters need to be discussed. A vote for independence is a once in a letime decision and all views and opinions must be heard before that vote is cast.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh.COMPROMISE FORSAKENMANY thanks to Keith Robertson for his letteradvocating tolerance and compromise. Unfortunately, on assuming power in , Nicola Sturgeon decided against the dficult but necessary job of creating a post-referendum Scotland at ease with itself within the UK. Instead, she has been leading us in the opposite direction, further and further from a consensus built on the outcome of the SNPrsquos own \"gold standard vote.She and her fanatical Yes movement will stop at nothing until they have secured independence, and will accept the slimmest majority and the most ided Scotland necessary to achieve it. We can only conclude thatshe and they really love Scotland, they have an extremely strange way of showing it.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.UNION FLAG DISLIKE IS NOT ANGLOPHOBIAPENNY Pondersascribes a derogatory comment made by a supermarket customer on the Union Flag to ldquocasual anglophobia. She appears to be making the strange mistake of imagining that the Union Flag is the flag of England, which of course it is not.A flag combining the crosses of St Andrew and St George, long-established emblems of Scotland and England, was introduced at the direct instruction of James VI on succeeding to the English throne, specically to symbolise the union of the two kingdoms. The later addition of the red saltire to represent Ireland in the Union was dictated by artistic rather than historical considerations: that device is from the family crest of the FitzGeralds and has no authentic connection with either St Patrick or Ireland as a nation but its signicance as part of the flag is perfectly clear.The entire meaning andof the Union Flag is shown by its name and absolutely no trace of either bigotry or racism is implied by the fact that supporters of Scottish independence are liable to dislike having it stamped all over the products we buy.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen.DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM SALMONDYOU report that Alex Salmond claims that Prince William demonstrates ldquopoor judgment by meeting with Prime Minister Gordon Brown . The former First Minister is obviously losing the plot.Last week Prince William and his we met Gordon Brown and his we, and listened to views on Scottish independence.Last week Prince William and his we met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and listened to views on Scottish independence.Why has Mr Salmond not accused the Prince of poor judgment over the Sturgeon meeting Walter Paul, Glasgow.HYPOCRISY OF THE HOME SECRETARYGEORGE Robertsonconsiders Fidelma Cookrsquos description of Priti Patel as \"like a black-shirted stormtrooper\" ldquocrossed a red line of decency and fair comment.

At the current delivery rate, fleet renewal will take -plus years.In addition, the operating subsidy from  to  amounted to pound million and is expected to rise by around -% annually.The report on the current Ferguson debacle intimates that Ferguson was the most expensive tender, had new non-shipbuilding owners and possessed no experience in delivering complex dual-fuelled vessels,Overall, we get a true picture of the level of CMAL management competence in decision making.Mr Hobbs asserts the need for more money even though pound million over five years has been granted for fleet renewal as well as additional funds for upgraded pier improvements to accommodate the new vessels. One could argue that his current comments are a pre-emptive endeavour to sht blame for non-delivery of vessels in the future to a lack of funds rather than an intransigence to explore more efficient ferry arrangements.In , the Scottish Government invited Stuart Ballantyne, a Scot Australian to present information regarding catamarans.

She was nearly  years old and could still do her designed speed of  knots. Ill admit the engine room was not a bed of roses, and that once we left Southampton on only one engine. But that problem was soon solved and we arrived in Cape Town on schedule. Not only did she do the Cape run all those years, she spent the war running troops all over the world, always running at full ahead to avoid U-Boats.The dference seems to be that the Stirling Castle was designed, built, owned, maintained and operated by competent personnel. Somewhere in CMAL and Calmac this competence has been lost. I would also add a slide rule was the most sophisticated bit of kit available in the s.To add insult to injury the PR handout from Calmac issued on the Loch Seaforths inauguration in  stated: \"Three backup diesel generators would allow her to operate to timetable even with one main engine out of service\".

The contribution from Scottish Renewables policy director Morag Watsonis criticised as disingenuous, even misleading, and is anything but reassuring. It begs the question:the intention is to rely on renewables are we in danger of sleepwalking towards an age of regular blackouts, or are we to rely on users having to pay for importing expensive electricity generated presumably from the sources we have abandoned Surely these concerns are so serious that it is time for a public inquiry into the extent the Scottish Government intends how the countyrsquos future energy needs can reasonably be expected to be met, particularly when renewables inevitably cannot meet the demand Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.TURBINES ARE NOT GREENALLAN McDougallsees wind turbines spinning, intermittently, as non-polluting, but consideration of the whole truth tells a very dferent story which is not at all \"green\".Their manufacture, overseas, and installation not only release much CO but demand lithium and rare earths from a near monopoly under Chinese control, using labour by youngsters working in a filthy, hazardous environment.In operation, they depend on large amounts of oil for lubrication and their ultimate demolition.

Some clubs have been able to retain revenues by streaming matches for a fee, and that will be a long-term positive that will help clubs boost revenues even after we have full gates again. But they have also borrowed and deferred payments and just how much pressure that will exert later remains to be seen.ldquoThe impact of limited numbers of spectators in grounds in Scotland may not have the same degree of negative impact for clubs here, as many have signicantly more extra ground capacity than their average pre-pandemic weekly attendances, added Pattullo. In November, Rangers annual operating loss rose from pound.million the previous year to pound.million - with a further pound.million required from directors just to see out the season.Meanwhile Celtics interim results in February showed a pre-tax half year loss of almost poundm up until December, where there had been a profit of pound.m in .Begbies Traynor partner Gerald Krasner, who led the team of administrators that successfully sold Wigan Athletic Football Club out of administration in March this year and is one of the UKrsquos leading football restructuring experts said: ldquoRights issues by shareholders have injected capital in some cases where owners have the means to step in, and in other cases bank debt and deferred payments to creditors including players and senior managers have helped.ldquoHowever, although these measures have been successful in securing the short-term survival of clubs and pushed the threat of administration further down the road, the cumulative effect is to build up a wall of debt that will have to be serviced and ultimately paid off.\""},{"url":null,"title":"covid-19-army-drafted-accelerate-covid-vaccinations","story":"NHS Lothian said army personell willprovide additional capacity at centresfrom next week as the health board ramps up first and second doses.The health board has previously warned that mass vaccination centres were facing critical staff shortages and issued anurgentalert for volunteer vaccinators to plug gaps in shts.A sourceclaimed the health board has up to  shts unfilled until Thursday.: NHS Lothian warns of critical vaccinator shortagesEdinburghhas seen an increase in newly diagnosed Covid cases in the past week, with one area - Davidsons Mains and Silverknowes - named as having the highest rate inScotland.Pharmacists have claimed major cities including Glasgow and Edinburghare experiencing vaccinatorshortages due to a decision to downgrade their payments - from pound per hour, which dentists and other staff receive,to pound, the same rate as nurses.

Or where those smiles due to the fact that the penny quickly dropped that they were getting out of their Friday Maths lesson,” quipped mum, Julie. The College pupils were curious, and were keen to know all about Jessica’s surgery. Their Class has been following ‘Jessica’s Journey’ with Miss Nelson..But many wanted to ask questions about Jessica’s surgery and recovery.“The questions included ‘how does she sleep with frame on, how long does the frame stay on, was it painful and how does the frame work to change the shape of the face and lots of other great questions,” outlined mum Julie.“It was wonderful for Jessica to be able to spend some time with her friends and for them to be able to gain a better understanding of what Jessica has been through over the last number of weeks.” Jessica won’t be able toto school until September, but will keep in touch with the class via Google Meet.Word of her visit quickly spreadWord of Jessica’s visit had spread quickly amongst the staff and it was wonderful to see so many teaching and non-teaching, go out of their way to come and chat with Jessica and Julie.“Each had been following Jessica’s Journey with great interest and they went out of their way during a busy school day to come and see her, to encourage her and offer their support,” outlined Julie. The school office staff were delighted to see their ‘friend’ back and to get one of their ‘wee daily chats’ with Jessica. “Jessica’s assistant often jokes thatshe ‘loses’ Jessica during the school day, she always knows where to find her – ‘the office’,” laughed Julie.Mum Julie was full of praise for Slemish College who have played a vital role in supporting and encouraging Jessica on this journey.“They have gone above and beyond during what has been a very challenging year for schools, to ensure that Jessica, although not able to be in school in person, has been very much part of the school community,” she said “And we really do appreciate all that they have done and will continue to do for Jessica. Their core values and ethos are not just words in a prospectus, they are lived out daily by staff and pupils alike and we look forward to Jessica getting back in person in September .” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622639095914.jpg--covid_19___wed_2nd_june_figures.jpg?1622639095000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210602newscovid 19 wed 2nd june figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

To have Davagh Forest following, it’s a remarkable accolade in the perfect location for a clear view of the stars.“I have no doubt it will bring tourists to this area and develop rural tourism on this side of the Sperrins. That’s vital in the more remote parts of Northern Ireland.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Dark Sky Observatory in Davagh Forest FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Dark Sky Observatory in Davagh Forest Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning.

It provides a fantastic opportunity for stargazing.”After sampling the interactive tools and trying the virtual reality headsets for size, the minister got a closer look at the centrepiece of the complex: a -inch LX Meade telescope, which allows stunning detail to be captured.The sophisticated device will be used to observe the night skies via a retractable roof and to transmit images onto large screens.Education is key, with the virtual reality headsets, touchscreens, binoculars, mini-telescopes and interpretative  designed to help visitors explore the solar system,The full night-time experience, including film shows, will follow in the autumn.The site was part-funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs . It has a nearby glamping facility to allow people to stay overnight and keep their eyes on the stars from the comfort of their beds.Work is under way to connect the observatory to the ancient Beaghmore Stone Circles, bringing the old and new worlds together.Councillor Cathal Mallaghan, chair of Mid Ulster District Council, said the project was designed to allow people to enjoy an untouched area of the Sperrins.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseVisitors to the Dark Sky Park can expect to see the heavens in all their glories FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueVisitors to the Dark Sky Park can expect to see the heavens in all their gloriesHe added: “It’s great to get it finally open. We’ve already sold out bookings for the next two weeks, so that really shows there’s a wide interest in this sort of thing.“This is only the second Dark Sky-recognised site in Ireland and we’re proud to have it here in mid-Ulster.“One of the advantages of having an area which has been under-developed over the years is that you can have this type of site that has no light pollution. It gives people a fantastic opportunity to come here and observe the solar system.“The thought that has been put in to the development is fantastic and it will give the perfect opportunity for experienced and amateur astronomers, and anyone  who would like to get a closer look at the stars, to do just that thanks to some very high-tech pieces of kit.“There are a wide range of activities here now. You can explore the solar system, there’s hundreds of acres, forest walks, cycle trails and a play area. It really has become a tourist destination right in the middle of the Sperrins.“We’re starting to see the infrastructure associated with that with brand new glamping pods. It’s becoming a very welcoming site for visitors.“One of the projects we have ongoing is to provide a walkway through to Beaghmore Stone Circles. That was actually the site of an observatory here thousands of years ago. It will be great to link the two places together.“This is a unique development in a truly special place, with an ancient landscape and amazing archaeology.“This opening marks a milestone in our strategy to build a strong, sustainable tourism offering in the Sperrins which showcases the region’s stunning landscapes and its history and heritage.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDundonald house death linked to car crash: Seven arrested over incident released as tributes paid for young mumTwelfth : What is happening and where parades will be this summer Nathan Carter apology for ‘irresponsible actions’ after birthday bash breaches Covid rulesPolice probe ‘definite link’ between death of womanin house and car crash in DundonaldDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldTop VideosPlay£. million observatory opens for public \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayHillsborough granted Royal statusLatest Northern IrelandCalls to extend job retention scheme for aerospace industryMedics warn that under pressure AE system is facing crisisHolby City: NI actor Niamh McGrady’s shock at axing of TV hospital drama Sinn Fein accuses DUP of snubbing another north-south meetingTV vicar Richard Coles ‘delighted’ as council agrees to memorial for NI gay rights campaigner Mark AshtonLatestEimear McGovernOpinionMost of us don’t have a garden big enough for  guests, but who hasn’t fallen off lockdown wagon like Nathan Education catch-up tsar quits over lack of funding on ‘awful day’ for GovernmentRachel Bilson reacts to Mischa Barton’s claims about her exit from The OCCalls to extend job retention scheme for aerospace industryManchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak regrets Super League involvement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tomorrow I have the Party Leaders’ Forum, but I will be making those announcements in the not-too-distant future.” Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Mr Poots met with MLAs on Tuesday in the wake of last week’s fractious party meeting.Afterwards, East Belfast MLA Joanne Bunting was named chief whip, with Assembly colleagues Trevor Clarke and William Humphrey appointed as her assistants.Mr Poots also named Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley, one of his key supporters, as his chief-of-staff, a new position. Mr Buckley will liaise with liaise MLAs on behalf of the party leader.The DUP leader said he was excited about naming his Executive team.“I’m absolutely looking forward to the challenge,” he added.“It’s obviously a very challenging time. Politics is a challenging game.“We have just got through a very dficult period. Northern Ireland is on the cusp of coming out of Covid. I had my second vaccination today, actually. That will open the door for us all to come out of the Covid pandemic.“Now we need to work on how we drive things forward, how we drive tourism, how we drive business, There’s also a health crisis – , on a waiting lists. That’s entirely unacceptable, I know that.”He also had words of praise for Education Minister Mr Weir.“We had some great work from him yesterday on educational underachievement,” Mr Poots said.“Those are the things we want to see and I intend to lead on that.“I have absolutely no doubt the party will be behind me. We’ve had a contest. It has been bruising. We’re through it.“I will be and have been reaching out to other people within the party.I am absolutely confident the vast majority of those people will be very happy to work under my leadership.”Mr Poots also said he had no qualms about reaching out to anyone after Justice Minister Naomi Long warned the DUP against “cosying” up to loyalist paramilitaries. Her comments came after a suggestion from DUP MP Ian Paisley that the party should “engage” with grassroots unionism.Mr Poots said he only needed to look across the Assembly chamber to see that engagement with everyone was vital.“Given that I sit in government with Sinn Fein, and given their role alongside the IRA over so many years, I believe that it’s incumbent upon us to reach out to all communities,” he added.“It’s important that we bring the loyalist community with us.“Many of them are disaffected by Stormont, many of them are disaffected with politics in general. That’s a bad place for us to be.“We need to engage.

East Belfast MLA Joanne Bunting was made chief whip with MLAs Trevor Clarke and William Humphrey appointed assistant whips.Ms Bunting was hailed as a good choice by both camps in the party. “She’s thorough, meticulous and an unbelievably hard worker,” one insider said. Ms Bunting is now likely to be appointed to the Assembly Commission.Mr Poots created new unpaid posts. One of his key supporters, Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley, was made chief-of-staff. It will be his job to liaise with MLAs on behalf of the leader.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMr Poots walks past a portrait of predecessor Ian Paisley at Stormont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMr Poots walks past a portrait of predecessor Ian Paisley at StormontMichelle McIlveen and deputy leader Paula Bradley were appointed welfare officers. It is understood Mr Poots will be bringing in outside assistance to support any MLAs with mental health issues.Every MLA appointed yesterday had supported Mr Poots’ leadership bid, but there is intense speculation that at least one of Arlene Foster’s ministerial team – Diane Dodds, Peter Weir, and Gordon Lyons – could be retained in the Executive, although moved to a dferent department, and that a Donaldson supporter will secure a committee chair.Education Minister Peter Weir declined to sayhe expects to be replaced in the reshuffle. He also pledged that whatever happened, he wouldn’t leave the DUP. I will remain loyal to the party and I will continue to fight the corner for unionism, in whatever role that may be,” he added.Mr Poots played down suggestions that appointing new first and deputy first ministers at Stormont could become mired in political contention, amid speculation Sinn Fein could use the process to gain a cast-iron pledge from the DUP on Irish language legislation before next year’s Assembly election. The DUP leader said he had received no ultimatums from Sinn Fein, nor did he expect any.Meanwhile, the new DUP deputy leader said she believed isions in the party could be healed. In a BBC interview, Ms Bradley said Arlene Foster had to go.I felt we had become stale, I felt that there were issues ... people were feeling somewhat at sea as a member of the DUP. I#m not saying she was to blame for all of that.She was the figurehead, she was the leader. Sadly, that#s the way politics works,” Ms Bradley said.

There was constant noise and constant screaming and shouting,” the woman told the Belfast .Bottles were being broken. There were gangs of people everywhere. Groups fighting on the ground. They were running like wild animals. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning.

The exams have also finished.” The resident added it was particularly bad around Agincourt, Fitzroy and Palestine streets. “I haven’t had any sleep.”Another resident said they had been kept awake for two hours due to the “relentless” actions of the young people.None of us manages to get through the week with a night of eight hours sleep. The situation is completely out of control and totally unacceptable,” he explained.The residents’ complaints come as Justice Minister Naomi Long warned new legislation to tackle anti-social behaviour is unlikely to be brought forward in this Assembly mandate –  despite a consultation on measures to address the problem closing almost three years ago.It is envisaged proposals will be brought forward to give councils more enforcement powers relating to anti-social behaviour, such as that frequently witnessed in the Holyland student district.In correspondence to a Belfast City Hall official in response to requests from councillors in the Botanic area for more enforcement powers, Mrs Long said her department was currently leading a multi-agency group tasked with formulating the legislation.A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police received several reports stating that groups of young people had gathered in the Holylands area of south Belfast in the early hours of Monday, May .“Officers attended and enquiries are ongoing.”Authorities have pledged to tackle the anti-social behaviour.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      It’s understood the basis of some of the complaints revolve around “intimidating and threatening” messages sent to senior members of the DUP who are close to Mr Donaldson.According to sources, the words “you’re next” were among the alleged threats directed at members of Donaldson’s team, while other exchanges were made on the phone and email.A PSNI spokeswoman said: “Police have received a complaint that a number of members of a political party had been threatened during a recent leadership campaign.”The Sunday Independent previously reported how the UDA’s “shadowy figures” had deployed bully-boy tactics by threatening DUP members to sign a letter of no confidence in Ms Foster.It was claimed that several loyalists helped to enlist support by “reminding” some MLAs thatthey did not sign the motion, their seats at next year’s Assembly election would be in jeopardy.During Mr Poots’ acceptance speech several prominent DUP members, including Mr Donaldson and Diane Dodds left the meeting on Thursday night.In a further twist, Ms Foster’s close friend and colleague in her Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, Paul Bell, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Poots’ ratication.Mr Bell warned the DUP will lose “thousands of votes” over the recent course of events.“We cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, but because of what took place before the election,” he said.A party ided, a police probe and several resignations within the next week are not the only issues Poots must deal with.His choice of first minister and how he responds to outstanding issues such as the implementation of Irish language legislation and the Northern Ireland protocol will be watched closely by Sinn Féin, his partners in government.Read MoreGail Walker:OpinionWhy Poots’ and Paisley’s Back to the Future strategy casts a shadow over not just the DUP but the Union“It’s important to remember the majority of parties and ministers in the Executive do not support his position,” a Sinn Féin source said.The source said the party has not ruled out refusing to nominate a deputy first minister after Poots’ proposes Ms Foster’s replacement, who is believed to be former communities minister Paul Givan.He is partly blamed for the collapse of the devolved institutions four years ago, when he and his officials cut funding for an Irish language initiative and forced an early election.“I am hearing September mooted for a potential election,” said another source.In Dublin, Mr Poots’ first few weeks will be watched closely by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who is expected to speak to the DUP leader about the contentious issue of the protocol.Speaking after his election as leader, Mr Poots claimed relationships between Belfast and Dublin “are really, really bad”.Meanwhile, the British-Irish Council will take place in Co Fermanagh next month, where Mr Martin, along with the UK government’s Michael Gove and Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon, will meet with leaders from Wales, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Northern Ireland.However, who will be leading Stormont remains to be seen as Ms Foster, who is still first minister, has threatened to quit this Tuesday — weeks earlier than planned —Mr Poots names her successor..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDundonald house death linked to car crash: Seven arrested over incident released as tributes paid for young mumTwelfth : What is happening and where parades will be this summer Nathan Carter apology for ‘irresponsible actions’ after birthday bash breaches Covid rulesPolice probe ‘definite link’ between death of womanin house and car crash in DundonaldDeath of Paul McKeown , discharged with ruptured appendix from Antrim Hospital, was ‘preventable’, inquest toldTop VideosPlay£. million observatory opens for public \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news eda .ece AUTOCROP wh bedcfbdaceccff.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice car involved in east Belfast crashPlayHillsborough granted Royal statusLatest PoliticsMark BainOpinionA fair start: But now it is up to the Stormont politicians to make it work Belfast City Council: Kate Nicholl installed as Lord MayorDUP’s Poots makes party changes but defers Executive reshuffleBrexit: EU ambassador accuses DUP’s Poots of lacking ‘adherence to reality’ over NI ProtocolDUP leader Edwin Poots expected to reveal new ministerial team with ‘surprise’ a possibility as need for olive branch to Donaldson campLatestEimear McGovernOpinionMost of us don’t have a garden big enough for  guests, but who hasn’t fallen off lockdown wagon like Nathan Education catch-up tsar quits over lack of funding on ‘awful day’ for GovernmentRachel Bilson reacts to Mischa Barton’s claims about her exit from The OCCalls to extend job retention scheme for aerospace industryManchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak regrets Super League involvement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its always good to come out of an interview having learned something new. “I know a lot of airline pilots who are scared of heights,” says Newbridge native Deborah Walls. “The key is to look out, but never down. Always look to the horizon, or eye level, and you wont get that wobble people can get with fear of heights.” A fear of reaching new heights has certainly never been a factor for Deborah. With data from the International Society of Women Airline Pilots revealing just over % of the worlds pilots are female, women in aviation are greatly outnumbered. Deborah prepares for take-off. googletag.cmd.push Deborah, who holds a private licence, always had an interest in flying, but it was a throwaway comment from a male acquaintance that finally set her on her aviation journey. “It was a fella that said to me, yeah, but you couldnt do it, you wouldnt manage it, and I just thought, well see about that,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just thought Id go and check out the flying schools and eventually went to Newtownards, because it seemed to be the most consistent training. I signed up and that was me. “There were more lessons cancelled than taken because of the weather, but I made it through. I would be studying on long-haul flights wherever I was going to, be it the States, Asia or South America. googletag.cmd.push “Id be on those flights studying for that period of time to do the exams. There is work involved, but like anything, it takes your commitment and dedication to get it. “Its not cheap for people. If you want to do it, you need to commit to it and stay the course. I see parents paying for their kids to fly and theyve maybe not taken it so seriously. “But this was coming out of my pocket, and Im not the type to do something like that. Once Im in, Im committed.”  Low-key misogyny is just one of the barriers placed in the way of women looking to get involved in flying, particularly in Northern Ireland.     “Ive always loved aviation. Even though it doesnt seem that long ago, when I was at school, it just wasnt a thing that girls did,” said Deborah. “Going to a Catholic school, the RAF Cadet scheme wouldnt really have been opened to Catholics in Northern Ireland. I hate to bring it back to that, but thats how it was. “Many young people take that route because its a sponsored scheme of training youngsters to fly, but it wouldnt have been open to me back then, and certainly not girls. “It was probably beyond the realms of affordability for most people. In my mid-s, I had a good job and was working back in Northern Ireland and I was able to devote the time needed to the training.” Deborah initially graduated from Ulster University, Jordanstown, witha degree in Biochemistry, before going on to complete a Masters in Business. The former St Marys Grammar School, Magherafelt student has spent  years working for a major oil company.  Her work takes her to all corners of the globe, but holding a private pilot licence has allowed her to see those corners from a very dferent perspective. “Ive worked in Scotland, Siberia, Angola and all over west Africa. I lived in those locations, so I wasnt just breezing in and out,” she said. “My other half is Australian and I really love Australia. I did a bit of flying there actually in January last year. It was just spectacular really. “Steve and I hired a plane and we flew inland to Wave Rock, out in the outback and it was a fantastic experience. “It is the typical burnt, red earth and outback that you would anticipate. It was in the middle of the Australian summer and it was very hot. “I love the heat, but it was hot even for me. Its just a vast land of burnt red earth. The pictures were good, and it was an excellent experience. “Thats the beauty of flying, you can do those experiences with your licence.”  Despite her wide flying experience, Deborah names the approach to Carrickfinn Airport in north Donegal as her favourite. Irelands unique scenery makes for pleasant flying, but the associated climate can cause problems for pilots. “I was once flying out of Newtownards, past Larne, and a storm was moving in around me, very heavy rain showers and cloud,” she said. “To my left, I couldnt clear because there was high ground and controlled air space, and to my right there was the sea, as well as very heavy rain showers in front. “It was almost like flying into a U-shaped band of weather that moved in very quickly and wasnt in the forecast.” The ordeal prompted Deborah to enhance her training further by attaining instrument rating, allowing her to fly through the cloud solely using the aircrafts flight instruments. “Its not a licence to fly in poor weather, but it is an extra set of skills, and the authority to fly using instruments only,” she said. “Had I had that skillset at that time, I could have got out of that situation easier, but I made the decision to turn and fly back to base.” In a nod to her own journey, Deborah has created a unique hashtag to signpost other female pilots, or those thinking of making the move, towards support and advice.  The -year-old launched #GirlsWhoFly in an effort to encourage young women and girls into flying. “I thoughtI could post positively about my flying adventures and experiences, there might be a young woman or girl, or an older lady, or whatever walk of le you come from, inspired to try it,” she said. “There have been a few ladies who saw the hashtag and contacted me, saying theyd signed up for a flying school, or joined the RAF Cadets, whatever it might be. “There are few women in the industry, I think women need to be encouraged to understand it is an opportunity for them. “Even flying privately, its a mixed bag. You find people who are extremely supportive of women flying and you find people that are skeptical, but gender should always be irrelevant. “I am no shrinking violet. I tend to laugh off or challenge people like that. If youre dedicated and want something badly enough, none of that will deter you.” The option of moving into the industry and becoming an airline pilot is still there, but Deborah says it is a love of flying, rather than any career ambition, that drives her. “My partner is an airline pilot, but Ive never felt the need to make a career jump like that,” she said. “I have a great job as it is and I like to fly as a hobby. My partner and I have bought an aircraft recently and its another thing youve got to enjoy for le. “It sounds awfully extravagant, butyou wanted to fly to Donegal for your Sunday lunch, you could do that, or fly to the Isle of Man, or anywhere in Europe. “We wont be flying over the Atlantic or to Asia any time soon, but for me, its the views you get from up there and the absolute love of aviation combined with the mental challenge it is as well. “Ive done many great things, but this is the best thing Ive ever done.”  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The bank holiday weekend is just hours away and the good weather is attempting a coup. A dull brightness begins to break through the grey clouds, leaving walkers on the street squinting and furrowing their brows. The clouds snarl in response to the affront, and tentative droplets of rain begin to find their way to the ground. Even in the warm, muggy air, the smell of a turf fire floats down the villages main street. Theres always one. Two school pupils are heading out the Clady Road. I glance at the time. .am. Exam season creates a flexible timetable. googletag.cmd.push The sporadic sound of traffic has all but given way to the birdsong, and the proleration of feeders in the local gardens are fuelling their melodic reverie. Two men stand outside a house on the way to Portglenone, in conversation with a woman across the street. One is brandishing a golf club in an apparent visualisation exercise, swinging it absent-mindedly around the garden.  The people I approach are not in a talkative mood, and after a few stops the reason becomes fairly clear. A power cut has left Clady in darkness at an inopportune moment. Hospitality is about to kick off its first fully reopened weekend – a bank holiday weekend no less – and local businesses are reeling from this latest setback. googletag.cmd.push Gym-goers at Pink X Fitness are making the most of the natural light to persevere with their workouts. In the Vivo, an exasperated manager tells me it could be  oclock by the time the power is back. In Teady McErleans bar, a solitary drinker sits at the bar, the chink of light from a half-raised shutter illuminating the pint in front of him against the darkness. With the village in a flap and counting the opportunity cost of losing out on a few hours electricity, no one is keen to fill two pages for a reporter. Out the Clady Road, heading towards Lavey, is an oasis of serenity by the road side. Opposite the Waterwall Bar sits Clady and District Angling Club.      There are two men sitting on a memorial bench outside the club house when I arrive, and within seconds of explaining myself Im inside and the kettle is on. The pandemic initially hit the club hard, closing all activities for months in the early days of uncertainty and fear, but gradually its role became crucial. One member describes it as a type of mens shed for the local community. “At the start there was no fishing whatsoever, but as things eased, people joined the club to get out and about,” he tells me. “Im glad to be alive, I had a run in with a bit of cancer in the lung and Im glad to be fit to move around at all. “I go up to the wee path for a walk, right up every day for a bit of exercise. Id have done that even before I took ill, I used to do the Fishermans Walk. I started when I retired. “I would probably know two or three that have passed away from Covid. Bad, bad times. Thank God everything is on the turn, the vaccine made a big dference. I feel safer.” The members explain the facility is benefiting not just the local anglers, but the whole community, with the pathway experiencing a huge increase in footfall since the first lockdown began last Spring. Francis McKenna and Danny Henry taking the time to answer our questions last week. While the other members chat to me, club member Gerard Webb has been busy procuring further interviewees. Sisters Laura and Clare McQuaide are part of a younger generation who are making the most of the clubs grounds, stretching both their own legs and those of their dog, Evie. “We just take our dog for a walk here most days, especially when there is good weather. We just find other, bigger places are not as clean and tidy, and this is handy for where we live,” says Laura. “I do think it is better now. This time last year, you were still able to get out for walks, but it was tough. I work in Ballymena and have been pretty much working during the whole thing. “We closed for two months, but Ive been working since last May and its weird seeing how people have adapted to it. It is better now, obviously with the vaccine. “People kept asking me how I found it, but for me, it was just the same. I work in Subway in Ballymena and it never changed –anything we were busier. “We used to always go to the cinema and its been a real loss. Just simple things – you dont realise how much you value them until you cant do them.” After Laura and Clare disappear over the bridge with a restless Evie, I head back inside the club, where Francis McKenna has arrived and is holding court. He tells me people need to be mindful that Covid- hasnt gone away. The gates at St Oliver Plunkett GAC, Greenlough. “Its still scary. In a way, Im still afraid that things arent right, and people are abusing it. People think its completely over, some people,” he says. “That really annoys me, when you see a couple of hundred standing with no masks on them. It doesnt feel right at all. “It affected my nerves at the start when I heard how many were dying with it. My we wouldnt have gone out of the house or let anyone in, including our own family. “That was the worst part. They could come to the window and all that craic, but she wouldnt them in. Shed even be wary today about letting them in.” Experienced enough to remember the feeling of war, even the muted panic of rural County Derry, Francis says the pandemic has created more fear. “When the war was on, the siren went and you knew to hide, or go to an air raid shelter or go somewhere safe, but with that type of thing, the authorities dont even know,” he says. “Theyre doing their best to tell the truth, but they dont even know the whole truth. Its very scary.” The sheer number of people using the facility has surprised Danny Henry, who has sidled into the room while Francis was in full flow. “One Sunday I came down here and there were  cars here,” he says. “The police actually came because they were parked in front of the Water Wall and thats a really dangerous corner. “At the start of the pandemic, I was up one Sunday morning, about  oclock, and there was this man and woman, a brave age, looking at a phone. “They were looking at Google Maps, and they asked me, because they were trying to work out where this pad takes us. “They were from Larne. They were here at  oclock on a Sunday morning. The pad leads right to Greenloughs old chapel. I dont even knowit was on Google Maps at all. “Im living here this  years, and I would never have thought of going to Larne to walk, and they were coming here.”  After a guided walk from Gerard Webb as far as the hand-crafted insect hotels on the pads, the uplting effects of such a serene, natural facility becomes very clear. There are horses grazing on the opposite side of the river. Ripples spread across the reflective bliss of the still water as fish top and tail in the May heat. Sunshine has won the battle of wills and is now bathing the village and its surrounding areas in light. On the way back through Clady, the power appears to have been restored. There are lights in the chippy. The hum of the drier from the hairdressers. Probably the boom of music from the gym. Normal service is resuming, and long may it continue.  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The bank holiday weekend is just hours away and the good weather is attempting a coup. A dull brightness begins to break through the grey clouds, leaving walkers on the street squinting and furrowing their brows. The clouds snarl in response to the affront, and tentative droplets of rain begin to find their way to the ground. Even in the warm, muggy air, the smell of a turf fire floats down the villages main street. Theres always one. Two school pupils are heading out the Clady Road. I glance at the time. .am. Exam season creates a flexible timetable. googletag.cmd.push The sporadic sound of traffic has all but given way to the birdsong, and the proleration of feeders in the local gardens are fuelling their melodic reverie. Two men stand outside a house on the way to Portglenone, in conversation with a woman across the street. One is brandishing a golf club in an apparent visualisation exercise, swinging it absent-mindedly around the garden.  The people I approach are not in a talkative mood, and after a few stops the reason becomes fairly clear. A power cut has left Clady in darkness at an inopportune moment. Hospitality is about to kick off its first fully reopened weekend – a bank holiday weekend no less – and local businesses are reeling from this latest setback. googletag.cmd.push Gym-goers at Pink X Fitness are making the most of the natural light to persevere with their workouts. In the Vivo, an exasperated manager tells me it could be  oclock by the time the power is back. In Teady McErleans bar, a solitary drinker sits at the bar, the chink of light from a half-raised shutter illuminating the pint in front of him against the darkness. With the village in a flap and counting the opportunity cost of losing out on a few hours electricity, no one is keen to fill two pages for a reporter. Out the Clady Road, heading towards Lavey, is an oasis of serenity by the road side. Opposite the Waterwall Bar sits Clady and District Angling Club.      There are two men sitting on a memorial bench outside the club house when I arrive, and within seconds of explaining myself Im inside and the kettle is on. The pandemic initially hit the club hard, closing all activities for months in the early days of uncertainty and fear, but gradually its role became crucial. One member describes it as a type of mens shed for the local community. “At the start there was no fishing whatsoever, but as things eased, people joined the club to get out and about,” he tells me. “Im glad to be alive, I had a run in with a bit of cancer in the lung and Im glad to be fit to move around at all. “I go up to the wee path for a walk, right up every day for a bit of exercise. Id have done that even before I took ill, I used to do the Fishermans Walk. I started when I retired. “I would probably know two or three that have passed away from Covid. Bad, bad times. Thank God everything is on the turn, the vaccine made a big dference. I feel safer.” The members explain the facility is benefiting not just the local anglers, but the whole community, with the pathway experiencing a huge increase in footfall since the first lockdown began last Spring. Francis McKenna and Danny Henry taking the time to answer our questions last week. While the other members chat to me, club member Gerard Webb has been busy procuring further interviewees. Sisters Laura and Clare McQuaide are part of a younger generation who are making the most of the clubs grounds, stretching both their own legs and those of their dog, Evie. “We just take our dog for a walk here most days, especially when there is good weather. We just find other, bigger places are not as clean and tidy, and this is handy for where we live,” says Laura. “I do think it is better now. This time last year, you were still able to get out for walks, but it was tough. I work in Ballymena and have been pretty much working during the whole thing. “We closed for two months, but Ive been working since last May and its weird seeing how people have adapted to it. It is better now, obviously with the vaccine. “People kept asking me how I found it, but for me, it was just the same. I work in Subway in Ballymena and it never changed –anything we were busier. “We used to always go to the cinema and its been a real loss. Just simple things – you dont realise how much you value them until you cant do them.” After Laura and Clare disappear over the bridge with a restless Evie, I head back inside the club, where Francis McKenna has arrived and is holding court. He tells me people need to be mindful that Covid- hasnt gone away. The gates at St Oliver Plunkett GAC, Greenlough. “Its still scary. In a way, Im still afraid that things arent right, and people are abusing it. People think its completely over, some people,” he says. “That really annoys me, when you see a couple of hundred standing with no masks on them. It doesnt feel right at all. “It affected my nerves at the start when I heard how many were dying with it. My we wouldnt have gone out of the house or let anyone in, including our own family. “That was the worst part. They could come to the window and all that craic, but she wouldnt them in. Shed even be wary today about letting them in.” Experienced enough to remember the feeling of war, even the muted panic of rural County Derry, Francis says the pandemic has created more fear. “When the war was on, the siren went and you knew to hide, or go to an air raid shelter or go somewhere safe, but with that type of thing, the authorities dont even know,” he says. “Theyre doing their best to tell the truth, but they dont even know the whole truth. Its very scary.” The sheer number of people using the facility has surprised Danny Henry, who has sidled into the room while Francis was in full flow. “One Sunday I came down here and there were  cars here,” he says. “The police actually came because they were parked in front of the Water Wall and thats a really dangerous corner. “At the start of the pandemic, I was up one Sunday morning, about  oclock, and there was this man and woman, a brave age, looking at a phone. “They were looking at Google Maps, and they asked me, because they were trying to work out where this pad takes us. “They were from Larne. They were here at  oclock on a Sunday morning. The pad leads right to Greenloughs old chapel. I dont even knowit was on Google Maps at all. “Im living here this  years, and I would never have thought of going to Larne to walk, and they were coming here.”  After a guided walk from Gerard Webb as far as the hand-crafted insect hotels on the pads, the uplting effects of such a serene, natural facility becomes very clear. There are horses grazing on the opposite side of the river. Ripples spread across the reflective bliss of the still water as fish top and tail in the May heat. Sunshine has won the battle of wills and is now bathing the village and its surrounding areas in light. On the way back through Clady, the power appears to have been restored. There are lights in the chippy. The hum of the drier from the hairdressers. Probably the boom of music from the gym. Normal service is resuming, and long may it continue.  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Following in the footsteps of the barbers opening their doors and covering a Larkin Cup game, it was another sure sign to this column that we are ing to normal. Unfortunately our soccer team didnt have the spring in our steps on ourto play last Wednesday. If we were a car, wed be on the scrapheap. The black smoke was bellowing out of the system and lights on the dashboard were flashing like a disco. Unless youre wee Co McEldowney. He never lost his wizardry and turned me inside out that many times, I didnt know what day it was. googletag.cmd.push But it was great. Banter, exercise and social interaction. Three things the sporting world missed by the lorry load. We are all going to have to live with Covid and any signs of it raising its head to the level that sport pauses sporadically. But, for now, its time to move on. Two rounds of the club hurling leagues have came and gone, while the football league rolled over the horizon last weekend. “Youll be busy now with the football being back,” is the most commonly used phrased offered in my general direction in the last few weeks. It is busy, but just a dferent kind. The endless weeks of nostalgia and shooting the breeze with some of the characters of the past have been swapped with live sport. And its great. googletag.cmd.push There is a buzz everywhere, with the mammoth boost that fans can make ato game. Also, its great to see Derry senior footballers taking a step on the path on the upward spiral. The Everest of Croke Park competing for the biggest prizes is away in the distance, but the long-suffering Derry fans have a group of players what could grow into something special. When it trickles down, it lts everyone. Fixtures lists are bulging. Social media and these pages are awash with teams back in full flow. Oh, but we have missed it more than words can fully explain.     The increase in games puts a stress on the availability of referees. Club committees have all the Covid- administration to keep on top of. Even going to report on a game brings regulations and health questionnaires to be submitted. This is the new norm, but to hear the sound of laughter and a balls thudding around pitches is music to ears that have been used to a silent wilderness of nothing. What is also pleasing is how clubs have adopted with swelling numbers. The U, U and U age groups have brought their own problems, with players out of underage before they are ready to compete at senior level. The U. and U competitions, while they look good on paper, they are not the same. But clubs have rolled out more recreational teams in the lower isions to mop up anyone who wants to play a game. The split season has given clubs their own identity back. As county teams get on with their own business, the rest of the GAA family have games aplenty. In Derry, the abandonment of relegation through the leagues allows everything to carry on. Slaughtneil have county players across two codes, with up to  featuring regularly with their footballers last season. The new arrangement allows them to full commit to the county scene and gives the CCC a chance to let the show go on for everyone . The new situation isnt totally bulletproof. When the dust settles on theto play, ato some form of promotion via the leagues is required. Some clubs playing in the junior and intermediate leagues as a result of the restructuring have no avenue to progress. It is the one tweak that needs considered for the long-term future of Derrys split season. As a dual county, its not easy balancing all the plates. But for now, games are coming with regularity and give everyone a chance to get back to how it used to be. Pitches are thronged with players of all ages. As for our five-a-side team,we take another tanking like we did last week, it might be time to break the bank and lure Jimmy McGuinness away from the clutches of Dundalk. His magic has worked with unfancied horses in the past. Maybe this is a bridge too far. Thankfully our offering is behind closed doors. Far from any watching prying eyes. But, sure lookit, its great to be back.  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Following in the footsteps of the barbers opening their doors and covering a Larkin Cup game, it was another sure sign to this column that we are ing to normal. Unfortunately our soccer team didnt have the spring in our steps on ourto play last Wednesday. If we were a car, wed be on the scrapheap. The black smoke was bellowing out of the system and lights on the dashboard were flashing like a disco. Unless youre wee Co McEldowney. He never lost his wizardry and turned me inside out that many times, I didnt know what day it was. googletag.cmd.push But it was great. Banter, exercise and social interaction. Three things the sporting world missed by the lorry load. We are all going to have to live with Covid and any signs of it raising its head to the level that sport pauses sporadically. But, for now, its time to move on. Two rounds of the club hurling leagues have came and gone, while the football league rolled over the horizon last weekend. “Youll be busy now with the football being back,” is the most commonly used phrased offered in my general direction in the last few weeks. It is busy, but just a dferent kind. The endless weeks of nostalgia and shooting the breeze with some of the characters of the past have been swapped with live sport. And its great. googletag.cmd.push There is a buzz everywhere, with the mammoth boost that fans can make ato game. Also, its great to see Derry senior footballers taking a step on the path on the upward spiral. The Everest of Croke Park competing for the biggest prizes is away in the distance, but the long-suffering Derry fans have a group of players what could grow into something special. When it trickles down, it lts everyone. Fixtures lists are bulging. Social media and these pages are awash with teams back in full flow. Oh, but we have missed it more than words can fully explain.     The increase in games puts a stress on the availability of referees. Club committees have all the Covid- administration to keep on top of. Even going to report on a game brings regulations and health questionnaires to be submitted. This is the new norm, but to hear the sound of laughter and a balls thudding around pitches is music to ears that have been used to a silent wilderness of nothing. What is also pleasing is how clubs have adopted with swelling numbers. The U, U and U age groups have brought their own problems, with players out of underage before they are ready to compete at senior level. The U. and U competitions, while they look good on paper, they are not the same. But clubs have rolled out more recreational teams in the lower isions to mop up anyone who wants to play a game. The split season has given clubs their own identity back. As county teams get on with their own business, the rest of the GAA family have games aplenty. In Derry, the abandonment of relegation through the leagues allows everything to carry on. Slaughtneil have county players across two codes, with up to  featuring regularly with their footballers last season. The new arrangement allows them to full commit to the county scene and gives the CCC a chance to let the show go on for everyone . The new situation isnt totally bulletproof. When the dust settles on theto play, ato some form of promotion via the leagues is required. Some clubs playing in the junior and intermediate leagues as a result of the restructuring have no avenue to progress. It is the one tweak that needs considered for the long-term future of Derrys split season. As a dual county, its not easy balancing all the plates. But for now, games are coming with regularity and give everyone a chance to get back to how it used to be. Pitches are thronged with players of all ages. As for our five-a-side team,we take another tanking like we did last week, it might be time to break the bank and lure Jimmy McGuinness away from the clutches of Dundalk. His magic has worked with unfancied horses in the past. Maybe this is a bridge too far. Thankfully our offering is behind closed doors. Far from any watching prying eyes. But, sure lookit, its great to be back.  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Over recent weeks, the council have discussed the issue of signage, with UUP councillor Meta Graham calling for an English first policy at a committee meeting last month. She told this months meeting that nobody was listening to unionist concerns. “We live in a erse society and everyone coming to live in Northern Ireland speaks English to some degree. It is confusing to not have English placed properly,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “The reality is that it causes tension, ision and bad feeling among people who previously lived in relative harmony. “Every time it is brought up, we have a vote, and every time we are out-voted. I would like our nationalist colleagues to actually hear what we are saying and asking, and not just vote us down again. Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake, however, citicised the latest motion to come before the council. “On reading the wording of the motion and listening to what has been said about Irish being something that is threatening, it simply needs to be called out for what it is,” he told the council. googletag.cmd.push “This is complete nonsense. It demonstrates both an inability to tolerate the language itself and to understand the rationale and need for minority language policies in the first instance. “Irish is a minority language, under threat, and thats why specic measures are needed to protect the language. “I dont think anyone would believe the English language is in any way being threatened with extinction.”  SDLP councillor Martin Kearney disputed a claim by Cllr Graham that everyone in the council used English as their first language. “Within Mid Ulster, there is a signicant Irish language community,” he said. “ people living in Mid Ulster speak Irish as their first language: , or .% can speak, write and understand Irish: , or % of the population have some ability in Irish.     “There is a challenge for everyone here - for Nationalists of all shades do not alienate Unionists from cultural capital which rightfully belongs to both traditions. “The defacing of English language signage is no more acceptable than the defacing of Irish language signs. “The Irish language is not and must not be allowed to be the possession of any one section or group within our community. It is a heritage belonging to and shared by all on this island. “In the neighbouring nations of Wales and Scotland the native language sits clearly at the top of the signage. “British pluralism has no problem with the use of Welsh or Scots Gallic on signage within these countries. “Surely what’s good enough for Wales and Scotland is good enough for us.”  The proposed motion to reconsider the councils policy on Irish language placename signage was defeated by  votes to .  --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Young man left unconscious after being assaulted and robbed in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katie SimpsonWoman arrested as part of investigation into murder of Katie Simpson in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Tuesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  How the planned apartment complex will look.New images reveal how planned apartment complex on the Tillie and Henderson site in Derry will look overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The protest will be outside Strand Road police station.Protest to be held outside Derrys main police station later today overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Company announces plans to create  jobs at a new facility in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry death notices - Wednesday, June ,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Danny Tallon on his championship debut in .Tallon withdraws from Derry senior squad overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia HOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offerHOSPITALITY HEROES: Discover all the outdoor attractions this county has to offer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"DOWN MEMORY LANE: Gemma Groogan celebrates her st birthday  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Out  About at Jacks Bar, Maghera  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

None of the men, who were wearing wet suits and le jackets, were seriously injured and it is believed adverse weather conditions caused the boat to overturn, said a Coastguard spokeswoman.As this incident was closing and the helicopter had just landed the casualties, Coastguards then received information that two young boys were being blown offshore in a small boat close to Ballyhornan.ldquoThe helicopter was re-tasked and itrsquos crew stood by with members of the Ardglass Coastguard unit, but the children, who were aged  and , were able to make it back to shore safely, she added.SAINTFIELD ndash Teenagers in Saintfield are being blamed for vandalising stone walls and blocking a river in the town.Concerned residents in Shrewsbury Dale have voiced their concern about what is happening and asked local councillor Robert Burgess to address the problem.Mr Burgess said residents and local farmers are becoming increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the teenagers and highlighted the importance of making them realise the error of their ways.He explained that over the past number of months, children have punched holes in local hedgerows to gain access to fields adjacent to the Shrews-bury Dale housing development.ldquoLivestock and horses have been in the fields concerned and we have to be thankful they did not escape as a result of the childrenrsquos action, Mr Burgess continued..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-NewPlaypark.jpg","title":"New £50k play park at Downpatrick school  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK primary school has officially opened its new pound, playground and garden facilities.St Colmcillersquos Primary School in Glebetown Drive now has a new sensory garden called the Rainbow garden, an outdoor play park and a new welcome garden at the schoolrsquos front door.School principal Stephen Austin said the facilities were financed by pound, raised by the careful management of the school budget and pound, from the schoolrsquos Parents, Teachers and Friends Association .Planns were drawn up last June and the work by contractor, All Play Ballynahinch, began in January.Mr Austin explained: ldquoThe school is set on a spacious site with several large green areas.ldquoI wanted to maximise the learning potential of our school site to improve pupils holistic learning experiences, particularly within the areas of outdoor education, activity based and play based learning which are essential areas of the curriculum and so important in eliciting enthusiasm in learning and developing key skills in core areas such as literacy, numeracy, ICT and STEAM.ldquoI also wanted to enhance facilities for our wonderful children who deserve the best and who were disadvantaged by interruptions to their schooling in recent times due to the Covid pandemic. But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers. They have enjoyed amazing support from our parents and the whole school community who all have been very generous. So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Please try again later.Submitting...Commemorating the opening of the Ulster Parliament BuildingsToday John is sharing some of the exhibits here marking the ongoing NI  centenary programme, which the whole of the UK’s postal service has been celebrating.During April and May, here and in England, Wales and Scotland, there has been a special hand-stampmarking the centenary with the slogan ‘Our Story in the Making - Northern Ireland Beyond ’.Along with the commemorative post-mark, the postage stamps and cards in the centenary display mostly depict “local places, people and events” John explained. Little or nothing has been omitted from the vast range of local themes and topics included.ouvenir commemorative cover marking the signing of the Anglo-Irish AgreementNo better place to begin, perhaps, than the State Opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament by the King and Queen on  June .There’s a magnicent postcard captioned ‘Their Majesties at the Ulster Hall.’ Before the pomp and glory of the formal ceremony, HM King George V and Queen Mary arrived in the city centre in a magnicent open carriage drawn by four white horses with top-hatted riders and footmen. The card shows lots of bunting and a canopy over the entrance to Ulster Hall.There’s a second carriage behind the King and Queen’s carriage, police guards on horses, a guard of honouron the footpath outside the Ulster Hall and police standing at attention with guns, in front of massive crowds of onlookers.More than a few bowler hats were being waved in the air. The procession passed the Albert Memorial Clock, draped in flags, the King and Queen’s carriage followed by a police escort on horseback. Another of the special centenary exhibits marks the official opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament Buildings by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales on  November .It’s a first day souvenir cover, with a drawing of Stormont on the envelope. The one and a half old-pence stamp is postmarked with the date, proclaiming ‘Ulster Parliament Buildings, Opening Day.’Staying with politics, a souvenir commemorative cover dated  November  is postmarked ‘Hillsborough’. There are three stamps on the envelope, and a black and white profile picture of Sir Edward Carson captioned “We Will Not Have Home Rule.”The Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed on  November  at Hillsborough Castle by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Irish Taoiseach Garret Fitzgerald, commemorated by this special cover. More recently from the realm of politics was Northern Ireland Devolution Day,  December , the first sitting of the Northern Ireland Government since  March . Bearing the beautully decorative £ Carrickfergus Castle postage stamp and two ordinary little p stamps, the Royal Mail Special Delivery envelope was posted in Parliament Buildings, Stormont, described on the envelope as “a temporary Sub Office of Castle Place, Belfast.”Roamer never knew that Stormont two-timed as a sub-Post Office, nor had I ever heard of an Irish Moiled Cow till I perused the NI  commemorative philatelic display. One of a number of first day covers of British Cattle issued on  March , Northern Ireland’s p stamp depicted the Moiled Cow, with a painting of the cow and a postmark bearing its profile on the commemorative envelope.The postmark explained - ‘The Irish Moiled Cattle Society. Founded , Ballynahinch, County Down.’The story behind the stamp is intriguing. Irish Moiled Cattle are an ancient breed that came close to extinction in the early s when numbers declined to a mere  calves and only two herds in the whole world. Today, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Irish Moiled Cattle Society and the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, numbers have increased dramatically though are still quite small. Moiled is an Irish word meaning ‘round headed’, applied to the cattle because they haven’t any horns. Thus they are great for small holdings and family farms as well as being hardy and producing high quality milk and meat in poor grazing conditions. It’s the rarest surviving indigenous breed of Irish cattle and the only surviving livestock native to Northern Ireland.Thank you to John Proctor and his philatelist friends for today’s wonderful stamps and cards, andanyone wants to see their Friday online display, contact John on [email#protected]He also tells me that the Portadown Stamp Exhibition and Collectors Fair, usually held at the end of September each year, will be held on the last Saturday of October this year - lockdown permitting.And there’ll be more from the NI  centenary philatelic display here soon.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  local people are urging the Cardf and Vale University Health Boardto build a health centre on Eagleswell Road, where a former primary school closed in .The disused plot of land is currently owned by Vale of Glamorgan council, and is allocated for  potential houses in the local development plan.But campaigners want the council to allow the health board to build a new health centre there, complaining the townrsquos current surgeries arenrsquot up to scratch.Councillor Gwyn John, of the Llantwit First Independent party, is organising the petition. He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.

The legislation was passed after an exemption was agreed which meant the Race Relations Board dealt with allegations of racial discrimination made by members of the royal household rather than the courts. reported an exemption still remains in place under the  Equality Act which replaced the  Race Relations Act, the  Sex Discrimination Act and the  Equal Pay Act.The newspaperrsquos reporting stems from documents it has uncovered relating to the use of the Parliamentary procedure known as Queenrsquos Consent, where the monarchrsquos approval is sought before legislation ndash which may affect either the royal prerogative or the sovereignrsquos private interests ndash can be passed by Parliament.Race has become an important issue for the monarchy after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex accused an un-named member of the royal family of commenting about how dark their son Archiersquos skin tone might be before he was born.The Duke of Cambridge has defended the monarchy against Harry and Meghanrsquos claims, saying soon after they were made ldquowersquore very much not a racist family.It is understood records on representation were not kept at the palace before the s, so it is not known when minorities were first employed in clerical roles.A Buckingham Palace spokesman added: ldquoThe principles of Crown Application and Crown Consent are long established and widely known.ldquoThe Royal Household and the Sovereign comply with the provisions of the Equality Act, in principle and in practice. This is reflected in the ersity, inclusion and dignity at work policies, procedures and practises within the Royal Household.ldquoAny complaints that might be raised under the Act follow a formal process that provides a means of hearing and remedying any complaint..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Palace  uhad practice of not employing minorities for clerical jobs in s u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLord Tryon, the keeper of the privy purse at the time, spoke about minorities in the royal workforce in documents unearthed by thenewspaper.The paper also outlined how in the late s civil servants and senior figures from Government negotiated with royal aides an exemption for the Queen and the household from legislation designed to prevent race discrimination.A Buckingham Palace spokesman stressed the Queen and the household comply with the present Equality Act ldquoin principle and in practice, adding: ldquoClaims based on a second-hand account of conversations from over  years ago should not be used to draw or infer conclusions about modern-day events or operations.A Home Office civil servant, TG Weiler, writing in February  summarised a meeting with Lord Tyron, then the Queenrsquos most senior financial manager, his deputy and their legal adviser in documents relating to the  Race Relations Act.The Whitehall official reported the palace aides as suggesting the Queenrsquos household fell ldquointo three categoriessenior posts, which were not filled by advertising or by any overt system of appointment and which would presumably be accepted as outside the scope of the billclerical and other office posts, to which it was not, in fact, the practice to appoint coloured immigrants or foreigners andordinary domestic posts for which coloured applicants were freely considered, but which would in any event be covered by the proposed general exemption for domestic employment.Mr Weiler went on to say: ldquoThey were particularly concerned, however, thatthe proposed legislation applied to the Queenrsquos household it would for the first time make it legally possible to criticise the household.ldquoMany people do so already, but this has to be accepted and is on a dferent footing from a statutory provision.     The legislation was passed after an exemption was agreed which meant the Race Relations Board dealt with allegations of racial discrimination made by members of the royal household rather than the courts. reported an exemption still remains in place under the  Equality Act which replaced the  Race Relations Act, the  Sex Discrimination Act and the  Equal Pay Act.The newspaperrsquos reporting stems from documents it has uncovered relating to the use of the Parliamentary procedure known as Queenrsquos Consent, where the monarchrsquos approval is sought before legislation ndash which may affect either the royal prerogative or the sovereignrsquos private interests ndash can be passed by Parliament.Race has become an important issue for the monarchy after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex accused an un-named member of the royal family of commenting about how dark their son Archiersquos skin tone might be before he was born.The Duke of Cambridge has defended the monarchy against Harry and Meghanrsquos claims, saying soon after they were made ldquowersquore very much not a racist family.It is understood records on representation were not kept at the palace before the s, so it is not known when minorities were first employed in clerical roles.A Buckingham Palace spokesman added: ldquoThe principles of Crown Application and Crown Consent are long established and widely known.ldquoThe Royal Household and the Sovereign comply with the provisions of the Equality Act, in principle and in practice. This is reflected in the ersity, inclusion and dignity at work policies, procedures and practises within the Royal Household.ldquoAny complaints that might be raised under the Act follow a formal process that provides a means of hearing and remedying any complaint..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Palace  uhad practice of not employing minorities for clerical jobs in s u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The IFS paper warned that signicant remedial action was urgently needed and the necessary responses were ldquolikely to be complex, hard and expensive.Without such measures, lost learning could translate into reduced productivity, lower incomes, lower tax revenues, higher inequality and potentially expensive social ills.It added that the effects of lost learning could possibly be neutralised for those from well-off families and the long-run negative effects could be concentrated amongst those from disadvantaged backgrounds. vw,vw,px, px\"The Education Policy Institutethink tank has previously estimated that a three-year funding package of pound. billion is required in England to reverse the disruption to pupilsrsquo education due to the pandemic.In a report, the EPI said that longer school days should be introduced so pupils who have lost learning amid Covid can take part in social and academic activities.It also added that school hours should be extended, more incentives should be offered for teachers to work in ldquochallenging areas, and some pupils should be allowed to retake the year as part of its education recovery plans.The money, announced by the Department for Educationon Wednesday, will be used to offer pupils up to  million hours of tuition as part of the Governmentrsquos catch-up programme for children in England who have faced disruption due to Covid-.The pound. billion is being made available on top of pound. billion that has already been pledged..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Education catch-up tsar resigns over fund for pupils article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
