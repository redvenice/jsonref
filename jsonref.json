Earlier this week, Royal Caribbean called off its Spectrum of the Seas cruise for 6 January after nine guests on its 2 January trip were identified as close contacts to a local Hong Kong Covid case. They have tested negative so far. The ABF did not confirm their names, but one is understood to be Czech player Renata Voráčová, according to Sky News. The ABF said: “The Australian Border Force investigation into the visa status of two other iniduals connected to the Australian Open has concluded.  “The ABF can confirm both iniduals have now voluntarily departed Australia. We will not be making any further comment about these iniduals at this time.  “All travellers who enter Australia must do so in accordance with our strict laws and entry requirements, regardless of their status or their reasons for entering the country.” It comes amid Novak Djokovic’s court battle to enter Australia without proof of a Covid vaccination.According to the French state-backed news agency, an average of 2,106,118 new daily infections were reported over the seven-day period, shortly after the 1 million case threshold was passed in the week beginning 23 December. The number of new cases reported in Africa remained stable but, as elsewhere, were at their highest level since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.Novak Djokovic relied on a weeks-old Covid infection to justify his vaccine-free travel to Australia and was given a green light by the federal government just days before arriving in the country, court documents reveal. Court documents associated with Djokovic’s challenge to his visa cancellation were published by the federal circuit court late Saturday, ahead of an urgent hearing on Monday. The documents reveal that Djokovic relied on a very recent Covid-19 infection, recorded on 16 December by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia, to argue he was exempt from vaccine travel requirements. They reveal he has also accused Australian government officials of unfairly pressuring him to accept a decision on his visa cancellation in the early hours of the morning, without the chance to properly talk with his lawyers or rest after 25 hours of travelling. Figures showed that three of the five UK areas with the biggest week-on-week rises in Covid case rates are Middlesbrough (748.8 to 2,651.4), Copeland (1,731.3 to 3,525.8) and Redcar \u0026amp Cleveland (846.8 to 2,564.3). Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M) highlighted these regions, along with the Midlands, as areas of concern. He said cases in London are “slowing down”, but scientists need two weeks to see if this continues. “Most other parts of the country are about two to three weeks behind where London is in their epidemic profile,” Tildesley told Times Radio. “Particularly concerning is the north-east and the north-west – if you look at hospital admissions in those two regions they are going up, also the Midlands, where I live, that’s also a little bit concerning, so it is a worry. “On the slightly more positive side, so it doesn’t sound all doom and gloom, what we are seeing from hospital admissions is that stays in hospital do appear to be on average shorter, which is good news, symptoms appear to be a little bit milder, so this is what we are seeing consistently with the Omicron variant.”In mid-December, Romania was reporting fewer than a thousand Covid-19 infections a day, but over the past week, daily cases have surged to around 6,000 - the highest number of infections since early November The new measures, which came into force on Saturday include the mandatory wearing of face masks in outdoor and indoor public spaces, and the banning of textile masks. Fines of up to 500 euros ($567) can be imposed on those who do not comply, authorities said. The health minister, Alexandru Rafila, told a press briefing on Friday that Romania is “already in the fifth wave of the pandemic” and that omicron is expected to soon become the dominant virus strain. “For the time being, there is a sporadic transmission (of omicron),” he said. “But it is very possible that in the coming days, the coming weeks, we will witness a community transmission supported by this new strain.” Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told Times Radio that the latest mutation of the virus was more contagious but less severe than previous iterations.  “The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new variant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. It’s very similar to the common cold that we’ve lived with for many years,” he said. “We’re not quite there yet but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term. It is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe. “Hopefully, as we move more towards the spring and we see the back of Omicron, we can get more inter-relationship of living with Covid as an endemic disease and protecting the vulnerable. “Any variant that does emerge which is less severe, ultimately, in the longer term, is where we want to be.” On his third day in immigration detention in Melbourne, the tennis world number one’s court filing has escalated a row over Australia’s handling of a medical exemption from vaccination rules that has become a flashpoint for opponents of vaccine mandates around the world.  Djokovic, a vocal opponent of vaccine mandates hoping to win his 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open, has been detained since Thursday in a Melbourne hotel after his visa was cancelled. He is hoping to win his 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open. Djokovic had received the exemption from tournament organiser Tennis Australia, with a follow-up letter from Australia’s department of home affairs saying he was allowed into the country. “I explained that I had been recently infected with COVID in December 2021 and on this basis I was entitled to a medical exemption in accordance with Australian Government rules and guidance,” Djokovic says in the filing, according to Reuters. Djokovic says he told Australian Border Force “officers that I had correctly made my Australian Travel Declaration and otherwise satisfied all necessary requirements in order to lawfully enter Australia on my visa.” The filing confirms rumours that Djokovic had Covid last month. It said he returned his first positive test on 16 December, but by 30 December “had not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 72 hours”.  On 1 January, it says, he received a document from Home Affairs telling him his responses indicated he met “the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia”.The scene, which was caught by Sky News cameras, was first broadcast on Friday after Javid visited Kings College Hospital in south London.  While on a walkabout in the hospital, Javid had asked doctors and nurses there what they thought about government plans to require vaccination for all NHS staff. After an brief but uncomfortable silence, Steve James, a consultant anaesthetist who has been working throughout the pandemic, replied: “I’m not happy about that.” James told Javid: “I’ve had Covid at some point, I’ve got antibodies, and I’ve been working on Covid ITUs since the beginning I have not had a vaccination, I do not want to have a vaccination. The vaccine is reducing transmission only for about eight weeks with delta. With Omicron it’s probably less. And for that I would be dismissed if I don’t have a vaccine? The science isn’t strong enough.” “That’s your view,” Javid replied. Turning to a group of nurses he added: “And you views?” However, they did not respond. Turning back to James, Javid continued: “I respect that but there is also many different views.” Javid added: “I understand that but obviously we have to weigh all that up for both health and social care and there will always be a debate about it ...” James replied: “Maybe there is an opportunity to reconsider with Omicron and the changing picture, or at least the nuance that will allow doctors who have had antibody exposure, who’ve got antibodies, who haven’t had the vaccination, to not have it, because the protection I’ve got is probably equivalent to someone who is vaccinated.” “Yes, but at some point that will wane,” Javid said.  James said: “But if you want to provide protection with a booster you’d have to inject everybody every month. If the protection has worn off for transmission after two months then after a month you’ve still got a bit of protection. But if you want to maintain protection you’re going to need to boost all staff members every single months, which you’re not going to do.” Javid answered his challenge by saying: “We take the very best advice that we can, from vaccine experts.” Half a day after the video was published on Twitter, it had been watched about 1.2m times. Taking this data into account, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised the government against giving a second booster dose, or fourth jab, to care home residents and those aged over 80, the PA Media news agency reports. It added that priority should continue to be given to rolling out the first booster dose, and that unvaccinated people should come forward for their first two doses as soon as possible.Term has already begun at many schools across the country, but others are yet to welcome children back after the festive break. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Saturday morning, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said there is a “mixed picture” of how Covid is affecting absences in schools so far this term. He said: “Not all schools and colleges are open yet and won’t be until Monday so we’re not going to get a proper picture of staff absence until next week.  According to the filing, the world No 1 tennis player contracted Covid-19 last month but was not experiencing symptoms. He returned his first positive coronavirus test on 16 December, 2021, but 14 days later “had not had a fever or respiratory symptoms of Covid-19 in the last 72 hours”, the filing said.  On 1 January, the Serbian sports star received a “a document from the Department of Home Affairs (which) told Mr Djokovic that his ‘responses indicate(d) that (he met) the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia”, the documents added. Djokovic is in immigration detention in Australia after having his visa cancelled on arrival on Thursday Djokovic, an outspoken critic of mandatory vaccination, has never disclosed his own vaccination status. He is challenging his visa cancellation in Australia’s federal court in hopes of winning his 21st grand slam at the Australian Open which starts on 17 January. A health ministry official said confirmed cases have exceeded 2.93m. Deaths have reached over 52,000, after 265 new fatalities were recorded on Saturday.  The previous daily record in Covid-19 cases was 26,303 on 11 September 2021.  Good morning and welcome to the coronavirus news blog.

"},{"url":null,"title":"are schools safe let s look at the latest covid data","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said latest evidence remains that schools are a ‘lower-risk environment for the transmission of the virus’. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins“Schools are safe”: it was the mantra repeated by Government ministers last year.No one is saying it now.In the face of the latest wave of Covid-19, there is apprehension on the part of everyone – ministers, public health officials, teachers and parents – over how things will turn out over the coming days and weeks.Public health officials gave the green light for the reopening of schools on Thursday on the basis that there was “no public health rationale” in keeping them closed.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said latest evidence remains that schools are a “lower-risk environment for the transmission of the virus” and the majority of children who are infected experience a mild form of the disease.However, he acknowledged that it was “inevitable” children would pick up the infection from household contacts over the coming days and weeks which, in turn, would lead to more cases and outbreaks in schools.It was little surprise, then, that so many schools reported record levels of pupil absences this week.While many were out of school because they were positive cases or close contact, principals say many families have been adopting a “wait-and-see” approach.“The reality is that if the Omicron strain really is four or five times more transmissible, then all the air filters, open windows and handwashing in the world won’t stop it spreading in school,” said one primary school principal.So, what does the latest data tell us?OutbreaksEven before the onset of Omicron, outbreaks in schools were not rare. Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) data released this week showed there were more outbreaks in schools – 514 – in the second half of last year than in any other public setting. This, of course, was at a time when the less transmissible variants were circulating.Many principals and teachers, however, are sceptical about official coronavirus figures.The removal of routine testing and tracing from primary schools in late September, they say, resulted in many outbreaks not being recorded.There is clear evidence of this: under the old testing-and-tracing regime up to 90 outbreaks were being detected in a single week during September.Yet, in subsequent weeks – without routine contact tracing in schools – the number of detected school outbreaks tumbled, even as Covid cases in the community began to rise.HSE officials accept that they did not have the same level of oversight or visibility of outbreaks that they did under the old testing-and-tracing regime.But in the instances where they did respond to outbreaks, they say the majority involved just a handful of cases.If the number of recorded outbreaks in school is not reliable, a better indicator is the age-related breakdown of confirmed positive cases.The latest information we have on schools relates to the weeks prior to the Christmas break, when the Omicron variant was just beginning to gain a foothold in the community.PeakHPSC data shows the incidence of Covid-19 among primary school aged children peaked in mid- to late-November at almost twice the average of all age groups.It began to fall significantly in December when face masks were introduced, falling back to below the national average when schools broke for Christmas.The proportion of cases among second-level students – where face masks are mandatory and many are vaccinated – has also remained relatively low.Given that the Omicron variant is rampant in the community, most expect that an upsurge in school cases is inevitable.Modelling by public health officials suggests the cases will peak in mid- to late-January, before falling sharply.Public health officials say the single biggest factor in limiting the spread of Covid-19 in school is keeping symptomatic children or close contacts out of the classroom and following the usual risk-mitigation measures.Schools, meanwhile, are bracing themselves for a bumpy ride over the coming weeks.While most managed to keep classes open this week, they worry about how many teaching staff will be available in the event of widespread outbreaks and how sustainable it will be to keep schools open."},{"url":null,"title":"feeder schools five take away points from the latest data","story":"Irish young people, unlike students in the UK, tend to apply for third-level places at their local colleges.  Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus record 26 122 covid 19 cases reported in state","story":"Parents bringing children in the 5 to 11 age category to be vaccinated against Covid-19 at the Show Centre, Cloghran in Swords.

Photograph:  David DaviesPA Builders and estate agents have piled pressure on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to reverse new planning guidelines, hitting out against moves to increase the number of larger apartments in the south Dublin suburbs. The objections centre on requirements for three-bedroom dwellings in 40 per cent of the units in big apartment blocks in “new communities” such as Cherrywood, the largest undeveloped land bank in the council area. Similar rules for build-to-rent apartments have also met resistance, with builders saying institutional investment would be damaged at a crucial time. In a sign of tension in the market as the council finalises its 2022-2028 development plan, one major developer wants exemptions from the 40 per cent requirement which is supposed to apply to schemes of more than 50 apartments. Quintain, which plans thousands of Cherrywood homes, called for a moratorium for well-advanced projects and those sent to planners before councillors adopt the development plan in March. ‘Significant delay’“Otherwise, a significant cost and time will be incurred to review and adjust the affected schemes to comply with the new plan requirements which will inevitably cause significant delay to the delivery of much-needed housing.” In a submission published on the council’s website, the company insisted there was only “limited demand” for three-bed apartments and said it had already made a significant financial outlay advancing projects. To back up its argument, Quintain sent in separate papers from estate agents Knight Frank and Savills Ireland. Knight Frank said the 40 per cent requirement should not be adopted, adding that demand trends favoured smaller units: “Introducing this requirement may delay the delivery of schemes as projects are reassessed and at worst render some high-density developments unviable.”Savills said market demand for homes of more than two bedrooms was “very much” focused on houses as opposed to apartments in suburban locations. “We have witnessed this trend growing further over the course of the last year as families are increasingly seeking to buy or rent residential units with private outdoor space (ie a garden),” it said.‘Build to rent’Cairn Homes, another builder, said the justification for setting a minimum percentage of three-bed dwellings in build-to-rent schemes was not supported by the council’s own market analysis. “The build-to-rent model is critical in delivering the shortfall in housing. If new stock is not built, then prices and rents increase. The lack of supply will have a detrimental impact on the wider society through increased rental costs, urban sprawl, etc.”Cairn also said some parking standards should be changed to “maximum figures” to encourage reduced parking provision and reliance on private cars, for climate reasons. Glenveagh Properties said the requirement for “certain percentages of three-bed units within residential schemes, in this case 40 per cent, is not considered commercially viable” given current market trends.Glenveagh has also objected to the council’s proposal on external storage requirements for apartments, saying it “would place an undue burden” on developments and appeared greater than Department of Housing requirements.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"planning guidelines what are cornerstones of builders objections","story":"Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council’s new planning guidelines call for more three-bedroom apartments, and greater storage space and parking.   Photograph: Chris RatcliffeA high-stakes tussle is under way between major builders and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council over new planning guidelines to govern apartment developments in south Dublin suburbs for years to come. Under the council’s plan, greater numbers of three-bedroom apartments would be built in key areas, while all apartment blocks would have to have better storage space and parking . The measures laid down in the council’s 2022-2028 draft development plan and proposed amendments have raised the hackles of builders and estate agents who sell new homes. However, the amendments have already been agreed by councillors, so they would have to reverse course to remove them – which now explains the lobbying effort under way.If followed through, the proposals would improve the mix and quality of apartments, requiring that 40 per cent of all apartments in all complexes with more than 50 apartments would have three bedrooms. However, critics argue that they will hold back the supply of new apartments, thereby worsening the long housing crisis that is still far from resolution despite a succession of State interventions. Indeed, the crisis has only intensified since the draft plan was first published in October 2020. The council has signalled it will adopt a plan in March, setting in place rules that will last for a decade.Property developersA public consultation on proposed amendments runs to January 17th. But dozens of submissions have been published, including a slew from property developers.Quintain Developments, which has plans to build up to 3,700 homes on 120 acres in Cherrywood, has questioned the plans for bigger apartments and better ancillary services in forceful terms.It has deployed estate agents Knight Frank and Savills Ireland on its behalf, while another big builder in the area, Cairn, wants key elements of the plan dropped. So, too, does Glenveagh Properties.Quintain’s 18-page submission makes clear its displeasure at the council’s actions. In a submission prepared by consultants Stephen Little \u0026amp Associates the company said it faced “significant” costs and delay to comply with such rules.“We note that there were significant numbers of submissions made on the draft plan that presented evidence in support of this objective being removed, including one by Quintain Ireland. It is regretted that greater heed was not taken of these submissions,” it said.“As one of Ireland’s largest residential developers and house builders, we believe there is limited demand for three-bed apartments in large-scale developments at the quantum proposed. Our view is supported by several highly reputed commercial agents who also have first-hand, market-driven data on what potential buyers and funders are looking for in new schemes. Evidence from our combined experience points to demand being greatest for one- and two-bedroom apartment units and we see this continuing to be the case in the future.”‘International capital’ Among other concerns, Cairn questioned proposals in which build-to-rent projects would be “open for consideration” as opposed to “permitted in principle”. In a submission prepared by consultants John Spain Associates, Cairn said such a move would have a “detrimental impact” on institutional investment critical for the sector’s growth “It is important to note that this inward investment is dependent on international capital which, similar to investment in the wider economy, is mobile. In this regard, it is inevitable that this mobile capital will be discouraged from investing in Ireland and seek to invest where the regulatory environment is more favourable,” Cairn said. “The permitted-in-principle use would also serve to give comfort to international pensioninvestment funds, where there have been some notable announcements of ceasing investment in the sector.”In its submission, Glenveagh questioned the requirement to have a certain percentage of three-bed units in build-to-rent schemes, saying it was neither clear nor consistent with national guidelines. A paper by consultants McCutcheon Halley said the 40 per cent requirement for three-bed units in certain schemes was “not considered commercially viable given current market trends and our client’s analysis and experience in delivering residential schemes nationwide”.The council did not comment on the substance of the arguments, saying 60 submission have been received and that its chief executive will prepare a report for councillors. But crunch time now looms. Builders have big play for late concessions. In coming weeks, it will be for councillors to decide whether to yield to their demands.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSinn Féin’s David Cullinane’s politics were, he says, shaped by two things The first were chats with his “staunchly Fianna Fáil and republican” maternal grandparents as a teenager in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but people who also had “a lot of admiration for Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams”.The second was growing up in the working-class Ballybeg estate in Waterford, where poverty and inequality lived side by side with “a real sense of community”, he remembers. “I loved it. Even though we didn’t have a lot, we had everything, if that makes sense.“Our parents made sure that we had everything. We had good Christmases, good birthdays, we always were able to go on holidays. But I was conscious of the poverty as well... of the perceptions that people had of the housing estate I lived in.”With Sinn Féin’s rise in the polls continuing, it could well be in government after the next general election with Cullinane – the party’s heath spokesman and frequent critic of the Government on Covid-19 – installed as minister for health.Cullinane’s political career has gone from getting just under 3,000 votes in the 2002 general election to topping the poll with more than 20,000 first preferences in 2020, after which celebrations that included him exclaiming “Up the Ra” emerged.Today, the Waterford TD says: “Obviously, if we’re in government, we will have a focus on a united Ireland. We’re United Irelanders.” But that focus could upset voters who, though they say they favour the idea, display little enthusiasm for it to happen quickly.The latest Ipsos MRBI poll put SF at 35 per cent, which if replicated in an election would put it in a lead position to seek to form a coalition. However, the same poll showed that a majority are opposed to paying higher taxes or other sacrifices to bring a United Ireland about.The results suggest a disconnect between Sinn Féin’s focus on achieving a united Ireland and the priorities of voters who turned to the party in their droves at the last election over issues such as the crises in housing and health.Cullinan denies that the contradiction will cause difficulties for SF in power. A United Ireland “makes sense” and would improve public services on the island, not curb them: “I don’t see how a ision of the country as small as Ireland is to anybody’s benefit. I think partition has failed.“And I think it makes perfect sense socially, economically and politically, to have a united Ireland. People don’t see Sinn Féin preoccupied with a united Ireland. They see it as Sinn Féin wants to see a united Ireland.“But they also see Sinn Féin very active on housing, on health, on the cost of living... and they know that if we’re in government, we certainly intend to deliver on all of those. So my job if I was the future health minister is to deliver better healthcare.“If Eoin Ó Broin was the minister for housing, his job is to deliver housing for people. If Claire Kerrane was the minister for social protection, her job is to deliver fairness and deal with the cost-of-living issues.“Obviously, if we’re in government, we will have a focus on a united Ireland. We’re United Irelanders. But equally we want to improve the quality of people’s lives. And I don’t see any conflict between the two.“In fact, I don’t believe that we’ll ever have equality on the island unless we have a united Ireland.”Growing up, Cullinane watched Questions and Answers on a Monday night hoping there would be a member of Sinn Féin on the panel.Television screens at the time would also have been filled with news reports on the latest Provisional IRA atrocities, such as the Enniskillen and Warrington bombings.What did he think of these when they happened?“I would have always had a view that I understood why people were engaged in physical force but I wished it was different. I think if I was to sum it up, my thoughts at that time they were, why can’t we just sort this out? Why can’t there be a solution?“And eventually we got one with the Good Friday Agreement.”Did he ever consider joining the IRA in his youth?“No.” He said that at the time he joined Sinn Féin – 1997 – “we were working towards a peace process. It just wasn’t an option and it’s not something that I ever sought out.“I always had a view that I wanted to see a political solution.”The Belfast Agreement happened shortly after he joined Sinn Féin at a time when he was a student at Dublin Institute of Technology. He secured a certificate in business studies before leaving college for economic reasons.Cullinane got a job at a car dealership in Waterford and while he enjoyed the work, “it was just a job”.Politics was where his interests lay.When he contested the 2002 election, then-leader Gerry Adams canvassed with him.He put in a respectable showing for a first-time candidate and was elected as a councillor in 2004 and became a full-time politician.He came in for much criticism for his “Up the Ra” cry after his 2020 victory.Cullinane has said he had made a “mistake” and apologised.Comedian Patrick Kielty recently delivered a well-received speech as part of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s Shared Island initiative where he spoke of reaching out to the loyalist community in the North.He said: “It’s way easier to sing a rebel song about a united Ireland than decide not to sing it in order to maybe have one.”Put to Cullinane that this could similarly apply to his “Up the Ra” cry, he says: “What we say is important. And I think we all need to be conscious of what we say, because we obviously have to deliver on our politics.”He praises Kielty’s speech and says it “makes perfect sense”, adding: “If we want to build a united Ireland, we’re going to have to put ourselves in the shoes of people who don’t agree with us.”He says he wants people who see themselves as British to “have all of their rights fully respected in a United Ireland”.Cullinane quotes the late Martin McGuinness and how he said: “I don’t want to see unionists treated in a united Ireland, the way nationalists were treated in a partitioned Ireland.”On health matters, what one thing would he have done differently if he were minister for health during the pandemic?“There’s so many things, but the one thing I would have done differently is preparedness, planning.”Cullinane says he sees lack of planning in areas such as the vaccine booster roll-out (which he says took too long to start), antigen tests and air filtration systems.On commentary criticising Sinn Féin’s push for a border poll he says: “The quicker I can see a united Ireland, the better, but I also realise that we have to build the foundations for a border poll.”Relationships would have to be built with “people who don’t agree with us” and there would need to be conversations “about what that Ireland would look like”. He says the Shared Island initiative is “worthwhile” but doesn’t go far enough."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"case colston four not based facts political feelings","story":"A Bristol jury this week controversially acquitted the four accused of causing criminal damage to the statue of Edward Colston, the 17th-century slave trader. After the verdict, many people, from Jacob Rees-Mogg Leftwards, have reminded us that the jury system is a pillar of our liberties.It certainly is. But instead of repeating this as a piety, one must state why it is so. It is not because citizens are well-versed in law: we are not, and cannot be expected to be. Nor is it because citizens should deal out punishments: judges, not juries, decide the sentence.It is because our history teaches us that a semi-random selection of our fellows is capable of judging facts after hearing the arguments on both sides. Twelve such men and women are probably better at this than legal professionals, who are much remoter from ordinary people and likelier to become agents of state power.That, at least, is what we in Britain think. In countries such as France, where the state is more revered and juries have only a marginal existence, they think our system is strange.In a way, it is. I have never served on a jury, but I have talked to many who have. All of them tell me in general terms of imperfections – jurors too eager to reach a verdict in time for lunch, or who think they are engaged in detective work rather than deciding on the evidence presented, or who have such a horror of a particular crime (eg, paedophilia) that they too readily assume guilt.But my friends usually report that the system corrects itself as it goes along, because the more conscientious jurors get the others to focus. None of them says we should get rid of juries.Since juries matter so much, however, we need to ward off threats to them. The most obvious ones come from intimidation or corruption. In a very ided society, this is a big problem.In Northern Ireland 50 years ago, terrorists threatened jurors who might convict them, and a jury dominated by one of the two communities would often be unfair to an accused from the other. So judge-only “Diplock courts” were introduced in serious criminal cases. This was undesirable, but necessary. Diplock courts were abolished, except in exceptional circumstances, in 2007, when the Troubles had clearly died down.Such threats are not a constant problem in Britain today, thank goodness. But there is a growing tendency – the Colston statue case is a prime example – of court cases being used as political theatre. Little standing armies of protest, often loosely associated with Black Lives Matter or Extinction Rebellion, wander the country looking for trouble.If they are arrested, they deliberately contradict themselves. On the one hand, they proclaim their innocence of any crime. On the other, they proclaim their courage in defying the forces of law.If the matter comes to court, they turn up in considerable numbers with vigils, placards and (as happened this week) a good deal of noise in the public gallery. When interviewed by the media, they always claim they are enacting the will of “the people of Bristol” (or wherever).Note how unfair this is to those who actually do represent the people. Marvin Rees, the elected (and re-elected) Labour mayor of Bristol, is the most senior black person holding directly elected office anywhere in the United Kingdom. After the acquittal of the “Colston Four” (all of them white, two of them originally from out of town), Mr Rees said that Bristol was not the place “to indulge your own fantasies of being a revolutionary”. Unfortunately, it looks as if it is.The more the protesters spread the story, in court and in the street, that they speak for the community – with media and social media fanning such claims – the harder it becomes for a normal local citizen who finds himherself on a jury to do the job properly.It is alarming to have that level of attention and potential anger directed at the decision of which you make up a twelfth. You would be brave not to worry about being called a racist if you arrived at the “wrong” verdict.Probably for that reason the judge, Peter Blair, directed the jury that the public excitement about the case was not relevant to their task. Their sole duty was to decide what were the facts.One has to go carefully here. No one but the jurors themselves knows what was said in their room, and it is right that we should not.The accused were undoubtedly present at the statue’s fall and enthusiastically participatory. One, Milo Ponsford, admitted turning up with 15-20 metres of rope, tying it round Colston, giving a signal that it was time to tug, joining in the pulling, jumping for joy on the fallen statue and messaging immediately afterwards: “Yeah, we pulled down the statue, ha, ha, ha.” But perhaps the jury felt the case that they had caused criminal damage had not been properly made out.What one can say, however, is that counsel for the defence and the accused themselves used the court not to persuade the jury about the facts, but for another purpose.True, they made half-hearted attempts at distinctions between being happy to pull down the statue and trying to cause it actual, positive harm, but their real message was that they had been “preventing further harm to the people of Bristol” (Ponsford), that the statue had been like “having a Hitler statue in front of a Holocaust survivor … if not worse” and constituted a “hate crime” (Sage Willoughby, another of the accused). Therefore, it was asserted, the jury needed to get on “the right side of history” (defence counsel).The verdict of the jury suggests that it took such words seriously. The trouble is that such words do not express facts. They are words of polemic and politics.Rhian Graham, another of the accused, told the court that it had been “poetic justice” when a black man had stood on the plinth from which Colston had been deposed. Perhaps, but it was not justice in the meaning of the word in a court of law.If juries are to mete out “poetic” justice, then they will no longer be pillars of our liberties. They will have become auxiliaries of the sort of extremist politics that loves making trouble and cannot win elections.I do have one smidgeon of sympathy with the accused, however. Jake Skuse, the fourth of them, noted in court that the police stood by during Colston’s deposition and did nothing. “How can I think it’s a crime?” he asked. He appeared to mean not only that he thought it the right thing to do, but also that the authorities were letting him do it.I fear Mr Skuse is right that there is now an element of official permission in attitudes to such protests, which is why the Government is tightening the legislation in reaction.This is permission not only in terms of policing, but in the attitude of the law itself. More than 20 years ago, the Macpherson report on the killing of Stephen Lawrence defined a racist incident as “any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person”. Such a definition, and the related concept of “hate crime”, elevated an inidual’s feelings over evidential fact.This created a problem of which the Colston case is only the latest example – the criminal law turned into a political battlefield, with justice the loser.More from NewsPatients \u0026#39watching Netflix box sets in ambulances\u0026#39 as NHS delays mountInept Government decisions are the real root cause of our problemsAustralian tennis chief praises staff for \u0026#39unbelievable job\u0026#39 despite Novak Djokovic visa sagaRecord numbers of Cubans attempting Florida crossing as decline acceleratesMinisters warned cladding reforms are \u0026#39not enough\u0026#39 to end anxiety for homeownersIsraelis flock to clinics for fourth jab as hesitant UK experts say another dose is \u0026#39not necessary\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays 4m pub landlord 20 year feud","story":"When Geoff Monks banned a woman from his village pub after a row about a bottle of wine, he assumed it was just another minor spat that punctuates the life of any landlord.However, he claimed that disagreement at his 17th-century inn triggered a council “vendetta” that culminated in him losing his home, health, business and even saw him languishing in a prison cell next to Ian Huntley, the Soham murderer.Now Mr Monks is to receive about £4 million after the council conceded its prosecution “should never have occurred”.The settlement was reached after Mr Monks, now 67, maintained his innocence for two decades, arguing that East Northamptonshire Council pursued him through the courts in a vendetta which amounted to an “abuse of process”.The last time anyone recovered damages for abuse of process was 160 years ago.In the latest twist in this protracted case, Mr Monks’s legal team, Laytons ETL Global, issued a statement claiming the guest he ejected from his pub was at the time involved in a sexual relationship with Roger Heath, the council’s chief executive responsible for the “final decision to prosecute” the landlord.On Friday night, the woman vehemently denied the suggestion she knew or had had an affair with Mr Heath, or that she reported the food poisoning incident to the council.Mr Heath could not be contacted on Friday night.In 1998, Mr Monks, at the time the landlord of The Snooty Fox in Lowick, Northamptonshire, claimed that he asked a villager to leave his pub after a dispute about a bottle of wine she was served.The woman was later diagnosed with food poisoning and the pub was reported to the council. The local authority investigation apparently uncovered “mouldy ham” at the premises in 1999.The following year, Mr Monks was prosecuted over food safety laws, both at The Snooty Fox and another of his pubs, the Samuel Pepys at nearby Slipton.He was convicted for The Snooty Fox allegations in 2000, despite what his lawyers described as “thin and contradictory evidence against him”.Because he was unable to pay a £13,500 fine and £8,300 of costs, he was sent to a category A prison in 2003. It was while he was at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes that he suffered a heart attack and was also placed in a cell next to Huntley, the school caretaker who murdered schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002.That year, Mr Monks was also convicted over allegations regarding the Samuel Pepys bar, but this was later overturned on appeal.It was not until 2015 that Mr Monks’s Snooty Fox conviction was overturned, following a referral from the Criminal Cases Review Commission.In 2019, Mr Monks took his case to the High Court. He claimed that the council had conducted 5,000 food safety inspections of premises that prepared food in the eight years before the case which resulted in just two prosecutions, compared with the three brought against him.Councillor Jason Smithers, the leader of North Northamptonshire Council, which last year took over the operations and liabilities of East Northamptonshire Council, said on Friday the settlement had been reached because the the prosecutions were “an abuse of process and should never have occurred”.He told the Northamptonshire : “It is accepted that East Northamptonshire Council’s actions caused serious personal injury, loss, and damage to him over a period of more than 20 years, and I sincerely apologise for those actions.“I hope that Mr Monks is able to have his reputation restored and that the substantial damages which the council has agreed to pay him go some way towards assisting him to move forward with his life.”A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said that an investigation was underway to establish whether any criminal offence had been committed in the miscarriage of justice which saw Mr Monks jailed. Geraint Thomas, the partner and head of the disputes team at Laytons ETL Global, said: “This settlement finally provides full vindication for our client more than 20 years after East Northamptonshire Council began its abusive campaign against him.“The impact on his health, finances and wellbeing has been nothing short of devastating, but I hope that today’s settlement will enable him at least to begin to rebuild his life.” More from NewsPatients \u0026#39watching Netflix box sets in ambulances\u0026#39 as NHS delays mountInept Government decisions are the real root cause of our problemsAustralian tennis chief praises staff for \u0026#39unbelievable job\u0026#39 despite Novak Djokovic visa sagaRecord numbers of Cubans attempting Florida crossing as decline acceleratesMinisters warned cladding reforms are \u0026#39not enough\u0026#39 to end anxiety for homeownersIsraelis flock to clinics for fourth jab as hesitant UK experts say another dose is \u0026#39not necessary\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds gyms face closure covid plan b measures harm public","story":"Hundreds of gyms are facing permanent closure this winter, it has emerged, as the Government was accused of “harming public health” by not including the industry in funding support.Plan B measures introduced in December to help slow the spread of the Covid omicron variant have led to a fall in revenue of more than £200 million, ukactive, the not-for-profit health body, said.City centre gyms and studios have had a 70 per cent reduction in footfall in December, and there are “serious concerns” that people will continue to stay away during the new year – a time period which normally sees 25 per cent of new joiners sign up.The initial UK lockdowns had already resulted in 400 gyms, pools and leisure centres closing, ukactive said.Without support, an additional 400 could also shut, meaning more than 10 per cent of the UK’s facilities will have been lost during the pandemic. There were approximately 7,200 facilities in the UK before Covid.It comes after the Government announced a new Better Health campaign to encourage people to lose weight in 2022.The marketing campaign teamed up with 15 weight loss and fitness organisations to help people understand these risks and provide tools and resources to lose excess weight.More than three in five adults are at increased risk of disease or becoming seriously ill with Covid due to being overweight in the UK.The Chancellor made no specific funding available for fitness and leisure facilities in the omicron support package announced in December, ukactive said.Rishi Sunak announced a £1 billion fund, mostly for hospitality and leisure firms, to help businesses through the omicron wave.Huw Edwards, CEO of ukactive, said the decision to exclude gyms, pools and leisure centres from the financial support package “threatens a growing number of facilities with closure”.“These decisions are regressive and will harm our public health, especially now, in the depths of winter, during a vital time in the year when this essential sector is on the frontline, providing safe facilities and spaces to support community health needs,” he said.Mr Edwards also accused the Government of “not heeding” the advice of Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, who has stressed the importance of exercise during the pandemic.Sir Chris told the ukactive conference in November “as we come out of the Covid crisis, it’s very important we try to get people who’ve got out of the habit of regular exercise back into a situation where they’re doing so, and encourage others who’ve taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn’t, to continue to do so”.The organisation has called for new grants to be approved for health and fitness businesses to “compensate for a lack of trade from Government intervention” and for the furlough scheme to be reinstated.Business rates for all health, fitness and leisure businesses should also be suspended for the first quarter of 2022, it said.“As we start this new year we remain fully focused on our personal health and wellbeing as we continue to live with the threat of Covid,” Mr Edwards said.To help the NHS we must “dampen down the need” for people seeking treatment, he said, adding: “Sport and physical activity can play such a bigger role in doing that, and if there is political will, we can make it a reality.”The Treasury was approached for comment.By Huw Edwards, chief executive of ukactiveWhen Professor Chris Whitty spoke at the ukactive conference in November 2020, he made very clear the importance of physical activity to our lives. “There is no point in life where doing more exercise does not improve health in multiple ways,” he said, before adding, “as we come out of the Covid crisis, it’s very important we try to get people who’ve got out of the habit of regular exercise back into a situation where they’re doing so, and encourage others who’ve taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn’t, to continue to do so.”But in the past few weeks our political leaders have not heeded this expert advice from the Chief Medical Officer in England. The decision to exclude support for gyms, pools and leisure centres from the latest Covid financial support package threatens a growing number of facilities with closure – particularly those in city centres which have suffered the greatest loss in footfall due the omicron guidance. These decisions are regressive and will harm our public health, especially now, in the depths of winter, during a vital time in the year when this essential sector is on the frontline, providing safe facilities and spaces to support community health needs.For far too long, national policy on physical activity has been reactionary, muddled and restrictive, and this urgently needs to change. This was reinforced recently by a House of Lords Committee that said Westminster had overseen an “uncoordinated and fragmented” sport and physical activity strategy that failed to deliver change.And let’s be clear this isn’t about lack of evidence on the value of physical activity. There is a library’s worth of evidence which many organisations champion on a daily basis. Here are three of the most powerful statistics:As we begin 2022, the focus on participation in physical activity is likely to grow. This summer, we host both the Women’s Euros and the Commonwealth Games, which are global celebrations of elite sport. Yet a large shadow will be cast over these major sporting events while large tranches of the infrastructure that supports our national physical activity levels remain under constant threat of closure.So things need to change and they can change.Firstly, and in the case of Westminster, we need to see all government departments acknowledge their role in supporting the physical activity of the nation. It’s unfair and wrong to determine the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as having exclusive accountability for this agenda – it doesn’t. The Treasury’s use of the tax system, investment in infrastructure via the Levelling Up Department, and the promotion of physical activity from the Department of Health are equally important to the work of DCMS.Secondly, we need to stop conflating elite sport, inspiration and population changes in activity. This conflation is to the detriment of everyone and means our sector has fallen short of playing its fullest role in society. It has created false hopes on matters such as “legacy” from major sporting moments. It has also deflected important focus away from the parts of our sector that are the lead drivers of activity on a mass scale – with fitness activities and swimming provision becoming essential, alongside walking, cycling and running.Thirdly, we need the Government to work with the sector to create a new strategy that brings together the required changes to investment, regulation and taxation that can grow the reach and impact of sport and physical activity on the physical, mental and social wellbeing of the nation.As we start this new year, ukactive remains fully focused on our personal health and wellbeing as we continue to live with the threat of Covid. We also care for the much-loved NHS which continues to meet the challenges of these unprecedented times. Ultimately, the best way to help the NHS is stop people needing it so much by dampening down the need for people seeking treatment. Sport and physical activity can play such a bigger role in doing that, and if there is political will, we can make it a reality.More from NewsPatients \u0026#39watching Netflix box sets in ambulances\u0026#39 as NHS delays mountInept Government decisions are the real root cause of our problemsAustralian tennis chief praises staff for \u0026#39unbelievable job\u0026#39 despite Novak Djokovic visa sagaRecord numbers of Cubans attempting Florida crossing as decline acceleratesMinisters warned cladding reforms are \u0026#39not enough\u0026#39 to end anxiety for homeownersIsraelis flock to clinics for fourth jab as hesitant UK experts say another dose is \u0026#39not necessary\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside story man defected north korea went back","story":"For most people, an insanely dangerous journey across a 2.5 mile-wide border guarded by barbed-wire fences, land mines, tank traps and several thousand troops at either end would be quite enough. But on New Year’s Day, former gymnast Kim Woo Joo did it for a second time, returning to North Korea barely a year after he’d escaped the world’s most infamous hermit kingdom for a new life in the South.Such ‘boomerang defections’ are very rare: of the 30,000 people who’ve escaped North Korea and settled in the South, only around 30 are known to have gone back. But what makes 29-year-old Kim’s boomerang even rarer is that he crossed both times via the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which separates the two countries rather than take the more usual route via China.A military security camera first picked him up at about 1pm on Saturday January 1 just south of the DMZ in Gangwon province. He was warned by loudspeaker to leave the area and appeared to do so: but six hours later, under cover of darkness, he was using his gymnastic skills to climb a 10-foot barbed wire fence on the DMZ’s southern perimeter. He was spotted on three more cameras, triggered a fence alarm and was later detected on thermal observation devices deep inside the zone, but nonetheless made it through unscathed back to the North – where, unsurprisingly, he has not been heard from since.He has left behind few traces of his temporary life in the South. At his crossing point military investigators found footprints and feathers, presumably torn from his coat by the barbed wire. Reporters who went to the tiny £85 per month apartment in northern Seoul where he lived alone found it empty save for a blanket, neatly folded, left outside for collection. He worked mainly as a night cleaner in office buildings, made few friends and rarely spoke to his neighbours. He left bills for rent and medical insurance unpaid, and he used as little gas, water and electricity as possible. He stands less than five feet tall and weighs under eight stone. Were it not for the attention around his escape he would seem almost a ghost, one of the millions of subsistence-level Seoulites whose plight was part of the smash Netflix series Squid Game.There are two main questions surrounding his escape: why go back at all, and why go back via such a dangerous route? The second is perhaps easier to answer: in one word, coronavirus. Controls on North Korea’s border with China, usually reasonably active with traders and workers crossing legally, have been hugely tightened in an effort to keep the virus out of the country, with guards reportedly ordered to shoot to kill. This has drastically reduced the scope for illegal escapes: in 2020, the year Kim defected, only 229 North Koreans came to the South, less than 10 per cent of the usual number.As for the first question: some return to deliver money to family members, to help a relative in trouble, or even to try and bring others out. But many find that they simply can’t settle in the South, for their original escapes are time travel as much as simple journeys. North Korea is a country stuck several decades behind the modern world: there are few private cars, agricultural equipment is basic and manual, and only the most senior and trusted officials have access to the internet. South Korea, in contrast, is a hyperkinetic futurist maelstrom on the cutting edge of progress: Bloomberg’s 2021 Innovation Index ranks it as the second most technologically advanced country in the world after Germany. To go from one to the other, even via countries such as China and then Vietnam, Cambodia or Thailand, is to experience the most profound and disorientating culture shock imaginable.Small wonder that newly-arrived defectors are enrolled in a 12-week residential programme run by the Ministry of Unification at the Hanawon Institute. Here they’re taught everything they need to survive in a modern society: how to use an ATM and a bank account, how to apply for jobs, how representative democracy works, and so on. The ministry also helps them with accommodation, arranges medical care and provides financial assistance, and once they leave Hanawon for society at large they’re assigned a mentor to check up on them and ensure that they have what they need.But even all this can’t solve every problem. As if the dislocation of this new existence wasn’t enough, many defectors have suffered profound trauma in making the journey. They often leave family members behind, opening them up to reprisals from the authorities. They live in constant fear of being caught and sent back, sometimes for months or even years until they can reach South Korea. Female defectors are often forced into sex work.And the welcome they receive in the South is by no means uniformly positive. Some find it hard to adjust to holding a much lower status job than they did back home. Chan-yang Ju, who left North Korea in 2010, said that “in the North my  aunt was a doctor, and she and her family were very rich and important in North Korean society, but in the South she had to work in a restaurant.” She returned home in 2018. Female defectors sometimes find themselves in demand on the dating circuit – ‘northern woman with southern man,’ as a traditional saying goes – but that too is a double-edged sword.Many report discrimination and being treated as second-class citizens, even to the extent of feeling obliged to disguise their accent in order to mask their origins. This was used in Squid Game (though the subtlety was lost on Western audiences) with Kang Sae-byeok – a North Korean defector who’s one of the main characters, only using her natural accent when talking in private to her brother.Almost half of the defectors surveyed last year admitted to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, even though – or perhaps especially because – such topics are largely taboo in the North. Where North Korea’s total collectivism means that nobody can go under the radar, South Korea’s more atomised society makes it easier for people to slip through the cracks. Defector Joseph Park says that “South Korea is a society where you can live without relationships. In North Korea you need relationships to survive, and the system forces you to have relations as well.”The South Korean government, recognising – perhaps belatedly – the extent of the problem, this week announced increased support for defectors suffering psychological and economic difficulties. Nearly 25 per cent of defectors are in the lowest income bracket, six times the ratio of the general population. But all this will come too late for Kim.So what will happen to Kim Woo Joo now he’s back in the North? No-one knows for sure. At the very least he will probably be forced to attend propaganda meetings where he will tell people how terrible life in the South is. He and his family may be punished further, which in the North tends not to mean community service – such service is seen as the everyday responsibility of every civilian – but prison camps, which are among the most brutal places on earth. ‘Gone to the mountains’, North Koreans call it: the euphemism for someone who simply vanishes one day and is never heard from again.

He was right to resist further coronavirus restrictions, to decry attempts to “bowdlerise” our history following the Colston Four verdict, and to accuse anti-vaxxers of spouting “mumbo jumbo”.To some extent, the Prime Minister appears to have become reacquainted with his Tory testicles over the festive period.Yet as Jacob Rees-Mogg (another man who was seemingly gifted back his Conservative cojones for Christmas) pointed out at Cabinet this week – the biggest threat to Mr Johnson’s premiership is not Covid, nor sleaze nor even Downing Street’s wallpaper bill, but the looming cost of living crisis.Quite rightly, Mr Rees-Mogg questioned why on earth Rishi Sunak was proceeding with the planned rise in National Insurance Contributions (NIC), pushing the tax burden to its highest since Clement Attlee was prime minister after the Second World War.Even deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner couldn’t quite get her socialist tax-and-spend head around it, telling PMQs on Wednesday: “Inflation is about to hit 6 per cent … millions of British workers face a further pay cut and his Chancellor is handing them a tax hike.”The Resolution Foundation think-tank predicts the NIC rise, which comes into force in April and breaks a Tory manifesto pledge, will cost middle-earning households about £300 a year.Since returning to the office after the festive break I have been inundated with data outlining how Britons are increasingly starting to feel the pinch, with Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, predicting it “could well be worse than the financial crisis”. And it’s not just tax, but household bills, too.“Millions of households could be thrown onto the energy breadline without urgent targeted support from Government,” screamed one press release from Uswitch, as Mr Johnson refused to scrap VAT on utility bills.Another pointed out how the price of petrol, which was roughly £1.11 per litre before the pandemic, is now the highest it has been in a decade, with experts predicting it could hit £1.50 per litre before long.Another, from the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that 58 per cent of firms expect their prices to increase in the next three months, the highest on record. Sixty six per cent of businesses cited inflation as a concern, also a record high.Such figures are deeply worrying – but so too is the Government’s seemingly cloth-eared response to the impending crisis. Like Gordon Brown blaming everything on the “global financial crisis”, we now have an intransigent Chancellor banging on about the need to tackle the NHS backlog, as if, miraculously, a £36 billion cash injection without any actual reform will suddenly solve all the health service’s ills.To make matters worse, yesterday we learnt that more than a million people are set to be dragged into the higher rate tax band by 2026.The Treasury’s plan to freeze income tax thresholds at a time of rapid wage and price inflation will push 1.2 million workers’ earnings above the 40p mark, according to analysis by the House of Commons Library.It is frankly hard to think of a worse way of treating the hard-working backbone of Britain that voted for Mr Johnson in 2019.During the Conservative Party leadership election, he had pledged to raise the threshold at which people start paying income tax at the higher rate to £80,000.Instead, we now have aspirational middle-income families finding themselves “fiscally dragged” into tax bands originally intended for the wealthy. This is a galling move by a Government seemingly incapable of controlling its own profligacy.For millions of people, even Red Wall voters at the last election, one of the main attractions of the Conservatives was that they were a party that supposedly stood on the side of people who want to get ahead in life.Like Mrs Thatcher’s manifestos in the 1980s, theirs was an appeal to the kind of people who want to save, buy their own home, get a second car, and go on a foreign holiday. The Tories have traditionally championed hard work and enterprise. They loathed benefit cheats and long-term unemployment. They represented the kind of self-improvement, taking-setbacks-on-the-chin, and getting-on-your-bike philosophy that Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague has, predictably, been criticised by the Left for espousing. (If Mr Johnson wants to capitalise on a half decent week, he would be wise to throw his support behind her Thatcherite thinking.)Lest we forget, this was precisely how he sold the Conservatives at the last election. There would be no tax rises. They weren’t those lazy Reds in Corbyn’s Labour, who wanted to confiscate your wealth. There was a more optimistic message towards immigrants: this is the country where you can come and be whatever you want to be if you work hard enough. The points-based immigration system was designed to judge people on their talents rather than their identity. And then, of course, there was Brexit: a brave new world, where buccaneering Britain would make its own way as a global free trade leader.But what has actually happened instead? We have 1.3 million people off work, because they are self-isolating, many with a mild bout of Covid. We have once again got millions working from home, crippling the high street and local businesses.We have higher taxes on workers – and the self-employed. And we have higher taxes on entrepreneurs via increased corporation tax. Contrary to claims that our corporation tax rates will still be the lowest in the G7, in fact our effective marginal corporate tax rates are now going to be higher than that bastion of economic dynamism, France. Zut alors!Meanwhile, there has been no attempt to take on the unions, with the likes of Unison telling public sector workers they can now take 28 days off without a sick note as a result of new Covid rules. A defiant email to its 1.4 million members this week read: “Proof of sickness cannot be requested earlier than 28 days.” Nice work if you can get it.And let’s not get started on the bloated public sector itself, with yet more money being ploughed into unreformed services, much of it likely to be eaten up in wages and pensions for middle managers so inadequate they would never be hired by any private sector company.Is this really the side the Tories want to be on – the shirkers rather than the strivers?While I appreciate that there is a pandemic-sized hole in the public finances, how does the Government expect businesses to pay their workers higher wages if they are contending with the effects of higher inflation themselves?Moreover, what possible incentive is there for employees to earn more money, if they are going to end up being taxed by stealth?The “fiscal drag” research suggests that this isn’t just going to affect high earners. An extra 1.2 million are expected to be pushed into the 40p tax band that starts at £50,070, than if the Government were to raise that threshold in line with forecast inflation to £56,270. But an extra 1.5 million low paid earners will also be pushed into the 20p basic tax rate that starts at £12,570, than if the personal allowance threshold rose in line with forecast inflation to £14,070 over the next four years. Such a freeze will collectively cost families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland £11 billion by 2026 – that’s an extra £430 for the average household.This isn’t just a betrayal of the electorate – but of Conservatism itself.More from NewsPatients \u0026#39watching Netflix box sets in ambulances\u0026#39 as NHS delays mountInept Government decisions are the real root cause of our problemsAustralian tennis chief praises staff for \u0026#39unbelievable job\u0026#39 despite Novak Djokovic visa sagaRecord numbers of Cubans attempting Florida crossing as decline acceleratesMinisters warned cladding reforms are \u0026#39not enough\u0026#39 to end anxiety for homeownersIsraelis flock to clinics for fourth jab as hesitant UK experts say another dose is \u0026#39not necessary\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"submarines collide far often think going get worse","story":"“Submarines are no longer undersea warships,” a naval officer once told me. “They are little bubbles of GCHQ sneaking undetected around the world.” Well, perhaps not always undetected. This week, it was revealed that a Russian submarine collided in 2020 with a British warship’s sonar – a cable hundreds of metres long containing listening devices – while tracking its movements in the North Atlantic. The equipment was so damaged, the ship had to abort its 48-hour mission and return to port. A Navy source told The  that the noise made by the collision would have been so powerful that officers “probably would have scared themselves s***less”.We know about the incident because a TV crew was filming on board HMS Northumberland, the damaged boat, at the time. It begs the question: do such collisions happen regularly – we just never get to see them through a camera lens?The answer is both yes and no. While collisions are considered to be vanishingly rare, submarines (also known as ‘boats’ in naval circles) do come into regular close contact with one another – and there’s a sense that it’s becoming ever more frequent. Dive beneath the surface of our seas and it’s as though the Cold War never really ended. “We are as busy now as we’ve ever been,” one source told me. “It’s a constant game of cat and mouse.”That’s certainly how it feels to the men and women out there every day, in Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force aircraft that spend their days hunting for submarines that lurk beneath. They search for telltale signs of human activity under the waves, or loiter on the seabed outside hostile ports, logging the inidual signatures of foreign warships to be referenced at later dates, perhaps in less peaceful times. “Russia has always been about submarines,” says a naval source, “it’s their thing”.To an extent, the rules of this cat-and-mouse game haven’t changed. Russia wants desperately to locate the British Vanguard-class submarine, one of which has been on patrol every hour for over 50 years, carrying Britain’s nuclear deterrent. Exactly where the boat is at any moment is one of the most closely guarded national secrets. The Government will also never say how many of the 16 tubes on board house a Trident II D5 nuclear missile, each with multiple 475-kiloton warheads (for comparison, Hiroshima was destroyed with a 12-kiloton bomb). However, the frequency of missions has changed markedly in recent years, with 2019 seeing the highest recorded Russian activity in the North Atlantic for over 30 years. And so too has the perceived aim of the activity. Where once Russia sent out its subs to find Nato’s nuclear-armed boats and threaten Armageddon themselves, now one of the primary goals appears to be hunting a very modern invention. The internet cable.Half a million miles of fibre-optic cables thread across the world’s ocean beds, carrying 97 per cent of global digital communications. Each strand of fibre inside the cables can carry up to 400GB of data per second, or around 375 million phone calls. Around 15 million financial transactions – worth $10 trillion – rely on the cables each day.In short, Britain’s economic prosperity and reputation as a major global finance centre depends on those cables. Prior to his appointment as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak wrote a paper for Policy Exchange titled ‘Undersea Cables – indispensable, insecure’. In it, he warned how disruption could lead to economic chaos and possibly civil unrest. “A successful attack on the UK’s undersea cable infrastructure would be an existential threat to our security,” the paper declared. It said that the cables represent “a singularly attractive target for our enemies”.Perhaps it’s little wonder, then, that Russian submarines have been “aggressively operating” around subsea cables for years. Reports in 2020 suggested Russian agents had been sent to Ireland to inspect the vulnerability of transatlantic fibres where they come ashore. As Tom Sharpe, a former Royal Navy commander and anti-submarine warfare specialist, says: “As long as the requirement to protect critical national infrastructure underwater remains, then the need to be able to detect and deter adversary submarine activity will remain.” He speculates that Russian mini-submarines may even have placed explosive charges on the cable network already, to be detonated “come the day of the race”.Technological advances are making the undersea problem more acute. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the Chief of the Defence Staff, says Russian submarines are getting “quieter, more capable and harder to detect”. Sources point to the new Yasen-class boats (“spectacular,” says one expert), and the small diesel electric Kilo-class submarines, which are capable of operating in much shallower waters (“tiny little Ferraris,” says another), as emerging threats. Like their western counterparts, these so-called ‘hunter-killer’ submarines do not carry nuclear weapons but are designed to hunt other submarines, or launch conventional missiles or cyber attacks against enemy targets.And then there’s the sheer proliferation of submarines around the world. China (which already has 59 submarines, although many are old), Iran (which has 17) and North Korea (71) are all believed to be developing modern boats. “The Chinese in particular are building them at a rate of knots,” says Sharpe. “How long before they send one round to the North Atlantic to take a look and prove that capability? Maybe they already have.”With such congested seas, it may seem surprising that physical collisions don’t happen more often. This is part of the game: submarines are extremely hard to detect and will do almost anything to avoid revealing their position. However, this also means they have little idea what is around them, or on top of them (hence why a source told The  that the HMS Northumberland incident was not a purposeful move by the Russians). Their ability to navigate isn’t helped by the fact that they will never emit a sonar ‘ping’ in an attempt to locate another vessel, as the sound would make them immediately obvious to anyone in the area or detectable to underwater acoustic sensor arrays located on the seabed. The ocean may be huge, but when you’re swimming blind, accidents will happen eventually.For the ships that sit on the ocean surface, it’s a slightly different challenge. They will occasionally ‘ping’ as their position is much easier to determine anyway, so they give less away by doing so. If a ‘ping’ locates a submarine, the ship can manoeuvre to stay outside weapon range. Sting-Ray Torpedoes or Mark11 Depth Charges fired from a frigate’s Merlin helicopter would then target the submarine. Ultimately, as Ali Kefford, a submarine warfare expert, puts it, “submarines are very much a political weapon, as well as a military one.” The cat and mouse games continue, day and night, in all weathers. Letting the other side know they’ve been found, as they try to maximise potential future advantages.“We are brothers and sisters. There’s a massive feeling of community. It doesn’t matter what nation you’re from.”More from NewsPatients \u0026#39watching Netflix box sets in ambulances\u0026#39 as NHS delays mountInept Government decisions are the real root cause of our problemsAustralian tennis chief praises staff for \u0026#39unbelievable job\u0026#39 despite Novak Djokovic visa sagaRecord numbers of Cubans attempting Florida crossing as decline acceleratesMinisters warned cladding reforms are \u0026#39not enough\u0026#39 to end anxiety for homeownersIsraelis flock to clinics for fourth jab as hesitant UK experts say another dose is \u0026#39not necessary\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Boris Johnson is sticking to Plan B measures which means people are being expected to take a testthey have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive for the virus.The quickest and easiest way to checkyou have the virus is to take a lateral flow test.Dr Nathan, an AE doctor in London at @expedition_doctor, said the three biggest mistakes are failing to spot positives, not reading the instructions, and mixing up the best way to conduct the test.He warned: “Any positive line within  minutes, evenit is so faint that it is barely visible, equals a positive result. “However,a faint line appears after  minutes, this can be ignored.” Hereaposs important things you need to know about lateral flow test and what you should doyou give a positive result.  Where can you get a lateral flow test  The best place to start is to find outyou are able to get lateral flow tests through your workplace, school or university.However, this option wonapost be available to everyone, in which case they can be ordered from the NHS website.Usually these lateral flow tests will be delivered to your home in a matter of days but there is currently shortage due to demand.  How much do the tests costs  Luckily, the tests are generally free for all purposes apart from travel. You can also go and collect them in person at pharmacies like Boots or Lloyds, as well as some community centres. Getting tests in this way is also usually free. A pack has seven tests, one for each day of the week. And, in some cases, you will be able to get two packs at once.  Is taking a test safe  According to health chiefs and medical experts, misinformation about lateral flow tests is re. Despite the risk of slight discomfort in your nasal passage, there is no risk to your brain when conducting a test.Along the same lines, misinformation spread on Facebook after a live video broadcast ly suggested ethylene oxide-coated swabs in lateral flow tests cause cancer.The Department for Health and Social care has addressed claims that Covid- tests pose a danger to humans. It told Reuters: Lateral flow tests have been rigorously tested and are safe to use on a regular basis. Any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate and harmful misinformation. Ethylene oxide is only used in the sterilisation of swabs and it is one of the most commonly used sterilisation tools in the healthcare industry, principally applied by manufacturers to keep medical devices safe. How to do a lateral flow test Before you take the test, you should blow your nose and wash your hands thoroughly. You need to put the swab about .cm into your nostril, and roll it around slowly for around  seconds. It will be easieryou continue to breathe through your nose while youaposre doing this. Some lateral flow tests are for your throat - in this case you need to swab your tonsils on both sides for around  seconds. Be careful not to touch the fabric of the swab once you have taken it out your nose or mouth. The test comes with liquid in a packet - you need to squeeze this into the small vial provided. You then need to put the swab into the vial - fabric end first - and press it firmly into the liquid while rotating it around  times. You can then dispose of the swab. You will have a nozzle cap for the vial - put this on tightly, and then carefully squeeze out two drops onto the specimen strip. Put this on a flat surface.  How long do you wait for a result You should wait for  minutes. Your results will appear - two linesit is positive, one line on the topitaposs negative, or one line on the bottomthe test is invalid.The lines may be faint - butthere are two, it means that you likely have coronavirus.What do you do with the test after Whether your Covid test is positive or negative, they should all be placed in the general waste bin. First place all the used items in the plastic pouch provided in the kit. The government website explains thatyou’re doing a home rapid lateral flow test, you should dispose of the used rapid lateral flow kit in your waste bin at home or at work. Used test kit items could include the:swab test strip sachet extraction tubeAccording to health chiefs and medical experts, misinformation about lateral flow tests is re. Despite the risk of slight discomfort in your nasal passage, there is no risk to your brain when conducting a test.  What to doyou test positive If you test positive for coronavirus you will need to self isolate immediately. This means you will need to stay at home for the duration of the self-isolation period. If you have one of the following three symptoms you will self isolate and take a PCR test. The result of this test will determine whether or not you need to continue isolating or are free to go out again as usual. The three NHS-defined symptoms are:a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteYou will also need to self isolateyou are contacted by Test and Trace, unless you are exempt, which includes people who have been vaccinated. If you need to self isolate and do not you could be handed a fine. If you test positive anyone who lives with you will have to self isolate also. However, there are major exemptions to this rule including vaccinated people. People aged over  years and six months who are not fully vaccinated will need to self isolate.

Ms Truss failed to disclose £,. of public money spent on fancy meals and drinks whilst on a three night trip to Tokyo in . The then-Trade Secretary flew to Japan between - October  to sign Britain’s first post-Brexit trade agreement. After the trip, the Department for International Tradeclaimed her travelling party had spent £. of public money on food and drinks, in response to a Parliamentary Question posed by Labouraposs Emily Thornberry. But two months after Ms Thornberry put in an FOI request, DIT was forced to reveal she had splashed an eye-watering £,. whilst away with three officials. Last night foreign office sources suggested that Ms Truss and her team had not been able to leave her accommodation as a result of Covid rules in Tokyo. But they were unable to say how they had accrued the expenses, or whether they stayed in a hotel with its own bars and restaurants.  The Mirror understands that it is usual practice for ministers to use their expenses on foreign trips to cover the cost of meals and drinks, including bills paid for by officials at the time. Shadow Attorney General Ms Thornberry told the Mirror: “There is a clear pattern of behaviour emerging here with Liz Truss, which raises serious questions about her character. “Becauseher instinct is to hide the truth and hope that no one asks questions even over these expenses claims, what  is she willing to do that about ” It is not the first time Ms Trussapos department has failed to correctly disclose the correct amount of public money she has spent on fancy meals. After her visit to Japan, Ms Truss spent four nights in Vietnam and Singapore to sign more post-Brexit trade deals with four members of staff. The DIT initially claimed Ms Trussaposs travelling party had not spent anything on meals and drinks. But then Trade Minister Greg Hands was forced to reveal the travelling party had actually splashed £,, the equivalent of around £, per head, or £ per night.  Mr Hands also revealed Ms Truss’s travelling party spent an eye-watering £,. on accommodation in addition to the meals. “How did they go from saying there were no subsistence expenses at all, to saying the travelling party incurred expenses of £, per head, equivalent to £ per night ” Ms Thornberry questioned. A DIT spokesperson said: “This expense was initially published incorrectly due to an administrative error and subsequently corrected. All DIT expenditure is published routinely in full. “The purpose of this trip was to sign a free trade agreement with Japan covering billions of pounds of trade, supporting jobs and growth across the United Kingdom.”It comes days after it was revealed Ms Truss hosted a lunch at an expensive private club owned by a Tory donor, after overruling civil service advice to look for a cheaper venue. Leaked correspondence, first published in the Sunday Times, revealed the ex-Trade secretary “refused to consider anywhere” but  Hertford Street for a meeting with Joe Biden ’s trade representative in August last year.Ms Truss is reported to have previously used the  Hertford Street club to host “fizz with Lizz” dinners with MPs and “biz for Liz” receptions with potential donors, in preparation for a likely leadership bid.The club is considered to be London’s most exclusive club, having hosted Prince Harry ’s first date with Meghan.

Major shareholders in the energy firms will amass billions out of rising prices and the NI tax hike won’t hurt too many millionaire Cabinet ministers or company bosses. In fact, according to the High Pay Centre, by am today the average chief executive of a FTSE  company had already been paid the average British worker’s salary for . And he’s probably still skiing in the Alps. There’s always been a gap between the rich and the rest, but it feels like it’s becoming a chasm. And the main dference between the top % and everyone  is their expectation to be treated dferently.  Think back to the Mirror’s revelations of how Downing Street held festive knees-ups after barring the rest of us from having a cuppa with a lonely old relative. They were angered that it was even a story – as though it was a given that they were free to act dferently. Look at the Establishment attitude to the loaded heiress Ghislaine Maxwell being convicted of facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of children. Her brother went on BBC Radio’s Today show to denigrate the jury’s verdict and tug on our heartstrings. Others sought to evoke sympathy for her by writing in newspapers about this charming woman who had been manipulated by the monster Jeffrey Epstein. If the paedophile-enabler had been a single mum on benefits, not a well-connected socialite, what are the chances of the BBC inviting her brother on to its flagship news show to plead her innocence  In the same case, we’ve seen Prince Andrew’s lawyers attempt to hide behind a silencing deal between Epstein and the woman who accuses him of sexual abuseto escape answering questions. And his family goes along with this stonewalling without being called out. Well they’re royal, ain’t they  Which brings us to the honours they dish out, most of which are bought. Sure, little people are thrown the odd bangle to disguise the charade, but the major gongs are status symbols the amoral rich seek out to show they are a cut above the rest. Last week, I named -year-old Folajimi Olubunmi-Adewole, who died in the Thames trying to rescue a drowning woman, as my Man of the Year. He didn’t make the New Year’s Honours list.  Tony Blair was knighted though, despite the Chilcot report stating he knowingly misled the country into a war which cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and  Britons. A petition to cancel his knighthood is climbing towards the one million that marched through London begging him to rethink his illegal invasion. But the man who has now made £million since leaving office will once again ignore it because that’s what the very rich do. That’s the power their wealth has bought. Chew on that in a couple of months when people you know are choosing whether to go further into debt with Scottish Power, or eat.

The submissions also see locals offer an insight on what itaposs really like to live there, citing factors like “endless rain” and shocking hygiene as reasons that should deter people from moving there.This year’s poll saw a substantial sht in the places that received the most votes for the “worst place”, with Hull, Wakefield, Torquay and Halax all rising in popularity to make their way out of the top ten. They were replaced by Bolton, Corby, Slough and Aylesbury, which shot up from its  ranking of th worst town, to receive the most votes for the least popular place to live. Hull, which last year was ranked th worst in the charts, made a jump to th place. While the move suggested a rise in popularity, one voter still went as far as to describe the town as a living hell for decent folk. Last yearaposs th place ranking, Wakefield, didnapost appear in this yearaposs list of Englandaposs top  worst towns at all. It was unclear whether this was due to improved living conditions, or whether the residents were simply too down in the dumps to vote at all. Torquay, which last year was crowned Englandaposs th worst place to live had this year received relatively less votes for the worst place, moving to rd place. It had earned a rather ineloquent review from one local as The English Sh*tty Area. And Halax had also happily vanished from the  list of Englandaposs top  worst towns, despite being ranked the th least desirable place to live in . This year the poll, compiled by iLivehere, found a new winner as Peterborough managed to drop to number five after three glorious years of taking the crown. Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire instead took the top spot, after scoring  per cent more votes than runner-up Huddersfield. Despite Peterboroughaposs reign being over, residents are still offered up some travel advice for anyone considering a visit. They claimed: It is customarya stranger holds eye contact with you for more than three seconds, to shout “WHAT”    and become extremely aggressive.  Discussing Aylesbury, locals said the traffic jams in the town are part of the magnicent beauty of the area and all part of the tour. They said: As you enter into Aylesbury, you find yourself in a traffic jam. Don’t worry, it’s all part of the tour. Being stuck in the traffic allows you to observe the magnicent beauty of all the ‘trashy citizens’ that live there. Huddersfield came in second place after scoring more votes than half the towns on the list.  One resident claimed: Not all of Huddersfield is bad… just % of it. Another resident last year made equally cutting comments about the town, saying: Huddersfield should be avoided by all those who desire to keep their wallets, mobile phones and most of all their sense of smell. Climbing a massive  notches on the list and sliding into the top  at number six is Bolton - which pollsters called the Mancunian dingleberry. One contributor admitted there are much worse places in Britain, but claimed the seemingly endless rain only strengthens feeling of sadness [...] and pointlessness of this place.  Another made a quip about the townaposs takeaway industry, claiming restaurants there have reached the lofty heights of ONE star for hygiene. The two non-movers in this yearaposs list were Huddersfield, Jaywick in Essex, an area described as making even the worst parts of Blackpool seem like paradise, according to voters.One said: There’s a reason why Ross Kemp visited what he dubbed as ‘Britain’s toughest seaside resortapos.  Satellite town Slough made its top  debut this year, coming in at number nine. A poetry fan recalled the words of poet John Betjeman, who famously urged bombs to rain down on the town. They wrote: John Betjeman had the right idea.

The -year-old boy was stabbed in February last year after he was lured out by Snapchat message he thought were from a girl wanting to meet up, Bristol Live reports. But when he arrived at the meeting point in Fishponds, Bristol, he was kned nine times and left for dead by two  year olds in what is described as a revenge attack.The two teenagers, who have since turned  and cannot be named because of their age, were sentenced to youth custody in Bristol Crown Court on Friday.A -year-old male, who stabbed the victim, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm ahead of a trial in November, while a female was found guilty of the same offence by jurors, BristolLive reported.During her trial, the jury were told the victim was part of a rival group within Bristol and was deliberately lured to the Ridgeway Road area that night so he could be attacked. The male received a four-year sentence and the female three years.  Judge Michael Longman described the attack as co-ordinated and done with the intention of causing very serious injuries. Detective Inspector Roger Doxsey said: “This was a vicious and calculated attack on a then -year-old boy. He was mercilessly chased and stabbed approximately nine times and left for dead. “Described in court as a ‘Snapchat honey trap’, the female lured the victim to a park in Fishponds on the understanding that they were having a date, whereupon he was set upon by a number of males with knives.  “After the attack the male offender sent a ‘mic drop emoji’ with his face on via Snapchat to the female offender. His emoji meant ‘job done’ and shows the true intent behind the crime. “The victim was in intensive care but has thankfully made a steady recovery from his multiple injuries. He bravely gave evidence and we are grateful for his and his family’s support.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtCrimeTeenagersKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Katie Fox, , and Tony Rewcastle, , visited The Grand on New Yearaposs Eve after spotting there were rooms available for just £.The pair did not have high expectations after being left unimpressed by a visit during the summer, Katie toldYorkshire Live.But they ended up having a great time, despite only visiting as a joke, according to the holidaymaker. We noticed straight away that they had refurbished, said Katie, who then quipped: Theyaposd got a new carpet. It didnapost smell like an old personaposs home anymore.  And the pair stayed in a new, refurbished room, which Katie thought was a lot better than it was before. She admitted she was surprised to find they had the best time ever. The couple celebrated the evening with a stroll along the beach, where they stopped for fish and chips, before heading back to the hotel to join in the festivities with the other guests. And the fun didnapost stop there. The pair then took to the hotelaposs balcony where they had a perfect birdaposs-eye view of the two firework displays which were set off on the beach. It was absolutely gorgeous, said Katie. She added: And there was a good atmosphere in the lobby. People were having fun they had music on, and there were kids running around with streamers and confetti.  Katie also praised the nice little touches made by staff: Theyaposd put a little chocolate bar in our room, all the hot drinks were in a bag sterilised, there was a little note saying happy new year, and they did free haggis at midnight. She concluded by recommending the hotel to anyone looking for a romantic New Yearaposs Eve, or just hoping to visit Scarborough. Katie said: My opinion of The Grand is they are doing things to change, and we genuinely enjoyed it. It is our go-to place nowwe go back to Scarborough. Previously, the hotel has responded to online critics leaving negative reviews. In response to one complaint, a spokesperson for the hotel said they were truly sorry adding: We hope you raised the concerns at the time giving us the opportunity to get it resolved during your stay.

The University of Warwickaposs Dr Mike Tildesley believes the world will soon learn toagain as normal. The medic, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Modelling group which feeds into SAGE, previously questioned the need for curbs.He raised hopes that cases are starting to slow in Covid hot-spot London despite the UK reporting nearly , new cases on Friday.Dr Tildesley pointed to the capitalaposs flatlining cases and hospital admissions as an encouraging sign that things are starting to turn around.  He told Times Radio: The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new iant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. Itaposs very similar to the common cold that weaposve lived with for many years. Weaposre not quite there yet but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term - it is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe. Hopefully, as we move more towards the spring and we see the back of Omicron, we can get more inter-relationship of living with Covid as an endemic disease and protecting the vulnerable.  But he did state that the North East and North West of England are seeing the most concerning rates of the Omicron iant. However, he added: It doesnapost sound all doom and gloom, what we are seeing from hospital admissions is that stays in hospital do appear to be on average shorter, which is good news, symptoms appear to be a little bit milder, so this what we are seeing consistently with the Omicron iant. His comments come after the Prime Minister told a Downing Street press conference this week that England had a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country.  On Friday, the UK reported , daily coronavirus cases and another  deaths. The government say there are , people in hospital with coronavirus as of the last count. Of those,  of whom are in ventilation beds. The R rate has increased and is now estimated to be between . and ., according to the latest figures.

We know now that Omicron is less severe… and we certainly know that once you get boosted that your chance of hospitalisation, our latest analysis shows, is almost % less than it was with Delta.

Clford Westfall and Clair Patterson live in Bradford, Yorkshire, with their nine children, as well as Clair’s brother and Clford’s brother, both of whom need extra support. But the family is now living in fear that they could be torn apart, after Bradford Council told them they must leave their home of two-and-a-half years by January . They even fear they could be forced to move into a hostel,they are unable to find another property by the deadline. Clford, , told Yorkshire Live that all they wanted was to be together as a family. The couple pay £, a month for the privately-rented property in Green Head Road and are desperate to remain in the area.Do you think the council should help this family  Share your view in the comments section below Their seven youngest children all go to school in Keighley and the family business, a toy shop in the town centre, is just a mile away. Clair said: If we lived where, it would be physically impossible for me to get seven kids to four dferent schools and then get to work. It just wouldnapost happen.” However, an extension to the property, built by the landlord, breaches planning regulations. The works exceeded the agreed dimensions and the house is now deemed too tall. Three separate retrospective planning applications and an appeal to the governmentaposs planning inspector have all failed. It led to the council obtaining a compulsory purchase order on the property. Clford, Clair and their family were initially told to move out by January . After Clford and Clair were told to leave, they said they asked for help from the council to find somewhere  to live after struggling to find anywhere suitable. There is nothing on the market for a family of our size, said Clford. We used to live in a three-bedroom house a few years ago. We were so happy, even though it was so small, but it just wasn’t big enough.  Since we have been in this big house, we have never been secure or comfortable. The council say they can’t put us in a four or five-bedroom house, because it would be overcrowded, but we need to be together. The couple say they have even asked whether they could have two homes knocked through into one. We’re not trying to be money-grabbers, said Clford. We’re completely willing to pay our way. We pay £, a month in rent. We pay £ a month council tax, we pay all the bills on our house. We don’t want a big house and for it to be cheap. We will pay. We just want to be together. Shortly after YorkshireLive approached Bradford Council for a comment, the local authority said it was trying to extend the deadline beyond January , but this is yet to be formally approved. A spokesperson added the council will continue to support the family throughout the process and that it is exploring the possibility of providing two accommodation units adjacent or in close proximity to each other. But Clford and Clair claim they have been told their family could be moved into a hostel. When they said that, I thought: ‘Is that for real ’ said Clford. “What’s one foot or two feet compared to making a family homeless  If we had to [leave Keighley] we’d do it. But a hostel  It just can’t happen. It wouldn’t work. The couple have one child together, but have custody for their eight children from previous relationships. The youngest is just two-years-old, while the oldest is . Local councillor Mohsin Hussain has tried to push the council to provide more help for the family. It is very dficult to find another property of this size, but I have said to the council that we need to find another property for Clford and his family to move into - or to extend the deadline,” he said. The council is not in the wrong on this, but there needs to be support from the council and from the housing associations for Clford and his family.” However, the family, who spent Christmas with the deadline looming large over their heads, are still no closer to finding somewhere  to live. The couple claim they pay their rent to Jigsaw Property Services. However, a spokesperson for the letting agent said they didn’t let the property out anymore. In a statement, a spokesperson for Bradford Council said: The breach that Mr Westfall appears to be referring to relates to planning permission rather than building regulations. This was obtained by the owner of the property in  to extend the house however, the actual works carried out went beyond that approved resulting in an unauthorised increase in the overall height of the property. Three separate retrospective planning applications for an increase in the roof height have been submitted since the works were undertaken. These applications were all refused and an appeal to the governmentaposs planning inspector by the owner challenging the decision was dismissed on May , . In view of this and as the owner failed to recty the breach, an enforcement notice was issued requiring them to carry out the work in accordance with the approved planning permission or demolish the unauthorised works. No appeal was submitted against the enforcement notice and therefore it should have been complied with by August , . With regard to rehousing Mr Westfall and his family, Mr Westfall and his family have been assessed by the Local Authority’s Housing Options Service in accordance with the Homelessness Reduction Act . The Housing Options Officer is currently exploring suitable rehousing options in the private and social housing sectors. This also includes providing two accommodation units adjacent or in close proximity to each other. Should Mr Westfall become homeless before the eviction deadline, the Local Authority will have a statutory duty to offer temporary accommodation with one of our commissioned providers. The temporary accommodation offer,needed, will be in the same location. The Local Authority will continue to support Mr Westfall and his family during this rehousing process. The council is currently in the process of preparing legal documentation to extend the current deadline of January ,  to allow additional time to source suitable housing options for Mr Westfall and his family. He will be in receipt of this documentation within the next seven days.

With a new man going viral this week in his bid to find a we through a billboard ad, the person who first introduced the trend has revealed what happened after his experiment – and what he thinks of the copycats.In February , Mark Rofe, , from Sheffield, paid £ for a -foot high and -foot wide billboard to find love. Since then, many others have followed in his footsteps. The latest lovelorn fella isMuhammad Malik , , who has erected ads in London and Birmingham with the tongue-in-cheek caption “save me from an arranged marriage”.“There have been several of these types of billboards since I did mine, and I’m sure there will be plenty more to come too,” Mark said. “I’m always happy to see them when they are done for genuine reasons, and Malik’s does appear to be genuine.  It takes balls to do something like this, so I have a lot of respect for that alone. “I hope it works out for him. I am sure there was perhaps some inspiration taken from the billboard I did, andthat is the case when Malik finds his we from it, I hope I at least get an invite to the wedding.” With Valentineaposs Day fast approaching back in , Mark had chosen to take drastic action in his hunt for a partner. He bought the m high and m wide billboard to advertise himself in Manchester city centre and had  applicants in just  hours. Speaking of the unusual stunt, Mark said he had over , requests and did eventually end up in a relationship. However, he said he didnapost find love from the ad. Now in a new relationship with someone he met in person, he admits he might approach it dferently in hindsight – especially as his new girlfriend told him she saw the ad but would never have considered applying because she thought he looked too desperate. Mark, who is the founder ofChristmastrees , said: “I don’t regret doing the billboard, but it comes with challenges and pressures that I hadn’t considered or foreseen.“The media attention and ‘going viral’ is a double-edged sword, it’s helpful for getting the word out, but on the other hand it was incredibly overwhelming. “It all became a little too much, to the point where, looking back, I probably wasn’t in the right frame of mind to be dating just after I did the billboard. “There are other pressures too, you can’t date everyone – or marry everyone, in Malik’s case – so you’re going to reject a lot of people. I was conscious of the fact that it takes courage to apply to date someone from a billboard ad, and I didn’t want anyone to come away from it feeling rejected or disappointed.  “Then there’s the other additional pressure of, whatI put up this billboard, and then I still don’t find someone ” Two years on, Mark also has some advice for what he thinks others need to do to make something like this successful. Details are very important, even down to the font. He added: “Use comic sans, it is the font of love, so I was disappointed to see that Malik hadn’t used it. “Be specic in what you are looking for. I didn’t specy my sexuality , and at one point half my applications were from men. “Have a thick skin, the internet can be a harsh place so be prepared to be called all sorts of things.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON LoveMarriageViralSexuality\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A poll by the NASUWT teachers union this week foundof the nearly , teachers who responded said they do not have access to a CO monitor in their classroom. From January , the government has said face coverings are recommended in schools with pupils in year  and above. It goes on to say they should be worn in most classrooms, and by pupils, students, staff and adult visitors when moving around buildings.  Revising the list of symptoms of Covid- The NHS website still lists the main symptoms of Covid as a fever, a new cough and the loss of taste or smell. The symptoms that have been associated with the Omicron iant have dfered with many reporting a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat. Professor Tim Spector, the scientist behind symptom tracker app Zoe, described the symptoms of Omicron as being more similar to that of a common cold. This means itaposs much easier to missyouaposre infected with Omicron, with Prof. Spector warning anyone with cold-like symptoms to take a Covid test to make sure.   Requiring high-quality masks for indoor public spaces New rules brought into force last month required anyone aged  or over to wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues including public transport. FFP masks are considered to be highly-effective face coverings. Many countries in Europe, including Austria, require these specic masks to be worn in public spaces. Independent Sage is recommending the UK government follows suit and requires this specic grade of mask for indoor public spaces as well as providing them for free to households.  Adequate sick pay for those unwell with Covid- From December,  sick pay rules wee being temporarily relaxed to help free up GPs for the booster rollout, meaning workers won’t need to see their doctorthey are unwell over the Christmas period. Under previous rules, workers who are unwell need to show their employer a GP-signed sick note after seven days to receive statutory sick pay or benefit payments. However, this was relaxed to  days – meaning you won’t need proof until almost a month after you fall ill. Anyone in work who goes off sick wonapost be asked for one until after  days of sickness, which includes non-working days. However, this rule is currently in place until January , . After that, the rules willto the normal seven day period.

He said he had been influenced by things hed read on social mediaStephen told loved ones he would get the jab as soon as he left hospital before sadly dying from the virus Image: BCUHB WALES NEWS SERVICEByJaymelouise Hudspith:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | comments An unvaccinated dad sent a heartbreaking message to the mother of his children as he lay dying of Covid in a hospital bed.Stephen Doyle, , was fit and healthy before he fell ill with the virus and was rushed to hospital over Christmas, his family said. The dad-of-three passed away on January ,  - after sending a text message saying he regretted not getting the jab.His cousin Michelle Pierce, a nurse practitioner at LlandudnoHospital, spoke on behalf of the family. She said they wanted people to realise coronavirus was affecting younger, healthy people who haven’t been vaccinated – and their families too, reports North Wales Live. Michelle, , said: “When Stephen was in hospital he texted his former partner Nichola and said: ‘I’m getting the jabs as soon as I can’. “He said he never wanted to go through this again. Sadly, he never got the chance to get vaccinated. It was too late for him. “He was against the vaccination before he went in and I would say he was influenced by all the talk on social media. “He had no underlying health conditions. He was fit and healthy.” The former docker, who was working as a dispatch supervisor at the time of his death, had already been in hospital because of Covid but was discharged with antibiotics in mid-December. Michelle said: “We don’t know whether he discharged himself or not but he was self-isolating. His ex-partner Nichola went to see him on December  and found him very unwell.” She called  immediately and Stephen was readmitted to hospital with breathing dficulties and very low oxygen levels in his blood. Within  hours he was moved to the hospital’s intensive therapy unitand the decision to put him on a ventilation machine, to take over his breathing, was taken on Christmas Day. The family say he also had a Deep Vein Thrombosisin his leg, which was concerning the medical team. Michelle: “Coming up to New Year the medical staff were quite positive and they were trying to get him off ventilation but his body was fighting it and they had to stop. He still needed mechanical ventilation to keep him breathing. “We got the call on January  to say his condition had deteriorated.” Doctors told the family Stephen had developed bilateral pneumothorax, which means both lungs had collapsed. Clinicians had to insert four drains into his chest to help him breathe. Lungs in Covid patients can become less flexible which means more pressure is needed to ventilate them. This can result in a collapsed lung. Sadly, in Stephen’s case both failed. Michelle: “The medical team at Warrington Hospital called us in and explained they were running out of options. “On January  they told the family there was nothing they could do. So the decision was taken to withdraw the treatment.” Michelle said Stephens’s mum Janet, sister Nicola and his former partner want people to understand Covid- was not just affecting the vulnerable. She added: “People need to know this is happening to healthy people. If we can save one person by making them get their vaccinations, it’s worth telling our story. “He was just a funny guy. He liked to make people laugh and was always up for laugh. He loved spending time with his kids and making them all happy.” Michelle, who also lost her unvaccinated father-in-law to Covid, revealed the whole family is “devastated and numb, angry and frustrated” – and feel their heartache could have been avoided.  “Stephen’s mum, my auntie, doesn’t want anyone to go through what we are going through,” she said. “A lot of people don’t need to go through this, do they  They should just get vaccinated. “All the people who we know, who were vaccinated but caught Covid, didn’t have severe symptoms. People believe things with no evidence. “Please go out and get vaccinated and prevent your family going through what we as a family are going through – it could be avoided.” Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board’s executive medical director, Dr Nick Lyons said: “I can only offer condolences to Michelle and her family for their sad loss. “I also want to salute their courage in thinking of others so soon after losing a loved one. “They are of course absolutely right - getting a full course of Covid vaccinations is by far the best way of protecting your health during the pandemic.“I would urge people to listen to their story and make arrangements to be vaccinated now, by going to our dedicated vaccination page at: COVID- Vaccinations - Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board nhs.wales”Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON New YearChristmasHospitalsTherapyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The shocking moment was captured on cameraLightning can be seen hitting the house roof, causing a fire Image: HandoutByLyell TweedLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan The shocking moment a lightning bolt struck a terraced house causing a fire and explosion was captured in incredible CCTV images. The dramatic images show lightning hitting the roof of a house in Ashton-Under-Lyne.The bolt of light instantly sparked a fire in the attic and neighbouring homes had to be evacuated after the incident at around .am this morning, reports Manchester Evening News. One resident who had to be evacuated told Manchester Evening News: “There was just a massive bang, it honestly sounded like an explosion. “You could instantly see smoke coming from the house and we called the fire service straight away.”  Residents of nearby houses sheltered in the pre-school, which was closed after the incident, after they were evacuated from their homes by the fire service. At least five fire engines quickly attended the scene and shut off the road to deal with the blaze, with police also in attendance. Businesses and homes were left without power for some time while the incident was dealt with. A resident said: “It was such a loud bang, it felt like it shook the house, then before we knew it there were blue lights everywhere. “It’s the last thing you expect to wake up to.”  Another added: “I don’t remember hearing it but it must have woke me up. As I came downstairs all I could see was blue lights and people leaving their homes, it was all quite scary at first I didn’t know what was going on.” The bang could be heard as far away as Oldham according to some on social media. Oliver Driver lives close to the street and said: “Heard it a few streets away and thought it must have been the thunder. Honestly sounded like a bomb went off outside the house though.”Another commented on Facebook saying: “I actually heard this at am from Oldham.“I knew it was bad because I heard sirens straight away. Really surprised that house is still there after how loud it was.”  One side of the roof on the property was completely destroyed with extensive damage inside the attic. Firefighters worked for hours to remove charred debris from the house, including blankets and old books and CDs. Luckily no-one was injured in the blaze, with residents let back into their homes around am. In a statement, a spokesperson from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Servicesaid: At approximately am on Friday, th January, firefighters were called to reports of a fire at a terraced property on Store Street, in Ashton-under-Lyne.  “Fire engines from Ashton, Oldham, Stalybridge and Chadderton fire stations, alongside the aerial appliance from Manchester Central station, quickly attended the scene. “The fire involved the roof space of an end terraced house.” Station Manager Ken Booth, officer in charge at the scene, added: Firefighters were called to a fire involving the second floor of an end terrace property. Fire crews have worked to prevent spread to the next-door terrace.

But that wasnapost always the case for Kate, who celebrates her th birthday tomorrow. As a teenager, she is said to have been shy and low in confidence after experiencing a tough time at school. When she was , she left that school and went to the prestigious £,-a-year Malborough College in . School pal Gemma Williamson previously told the Daily Mail: “Apparently she had been bullied very badly and she certainly looked thin and pale. She had very little confidence.”  However, at Marlborough, she sought solace in playing sports and then experienced a sudden turnaround that left every boy in the school rather flustered. And that turnaround is said to have come when Kate ed from the summer break aged . Gemma revealed that, after impressing school pals playing hockey and going cross-country running, the future duchess became “an absolute beauty” and “every boy in the school fancied her rotten”.

Her former teacher, Denise Alford, also revealed that Kate was able to transform her look after losing one key thing - her childhood braces. “Pippa was a tomboy but Kate had lost her braces and looked stunning, she told the Mail. “She was apparently top of the ‘Fit List’ which boys would sometimes pin on the walls.  When Kate left Marlborough with three A-Levels, she embarked on a gap year before deciding to attend St Andrews University, where she met her future husband, Prince William. There Kateaposs self-confidence famously won over William when she wore a see-through dress at a fashion show. In , the then -year-old prince reportedly spent £ for a front-row ticket for the charity fashion show his future we featured in. Here he saw Kate walking the catwalk in a see-through lace dress revealing her black underwear underneath. The duchess is said to have made the transformation from Williamaposs friend to his love interest after he saw her in the fashion show and said: Wow, Kateaposs hot. That started their romance, and now  years on the pair have been married for almost  years and have three gorgeous children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

WhatCar, an automobile magazine, reports that drivers are actually banned from parking their cars against the direction of traffic unless there’s a marked out parking space. Even the most disciplined driver could be forgiven for not knowing this unusual fact. The Highway Code lists under Rule  that a car must not be parked at the side of the road facing against the direction of traffic unless in a recognised parking space”. If it is, then you could be breaking the law.This is because parking facing the traffic on unlit roads can be extremely dangerous, according to car scrapping comparison site, scrapcarcomparison. This means it could be harder for other motorists to detect what you are doing, potentially leading to crashes.  Cars parked in the same direction of traffic will have the rear reflectors illuminated. For most vehicles, the offence could cost around £,, whereas for eight-seaters, this jumps to £,. Another sloppy parking habit has seen motorists fined for leaning slightly over the edge of a parking bay - an expensive start to the year and unwelcome surprise after Christmas. Leaving your car stationary in a parking bay should be a fairly straightforward process - but you can actually get finedyou donapost stick to the rules.As the Mirror reported last month, a driver left the side of his car protruding slightly over the bay line in Birmingham City Centre, encroaching on the space next door. He was charged £ for doing so. The fine - which would be reduced to £paid within  days - was issued by private firm Premier Parking Enforcement LTD who are contracted by building management company Remus.

After becoming a surrogate for the first time  years ago, the mum of four says the feeling of handing over the baby and seeing the coupleaposs instant and unconditional love for the child can be addictive. All of her surrogate pregnancies have been through in vitro fertilisation , meaning the coupleaposs fertilised egg is implanted in Lauraaposs womb so genetically none of the babies are hers.The single mum from Bradley, Huddersfield, told ExaminerLive : I love being a mum, it’s the best job in the world, and I love that I can help someone fulfil their dream to become a parent. Speaking of the moment she gets to pass the newborn over to the intended parents, she said: Once you see the baby in their arms you can see that unconditional love immediately. It is just so worth it. That feeling can be slightly addictive. Inspired by a TV programme, mum to April, , Rowan, , Ada, six, and Eira, two, decided to become a surrogate for the first time after the births of her first two children. That unconditional love that I felt, I thought how lucky I was to have that and so thoughtI could help others, then why not  Once they are old enough they will know who I am and that they grew in my tummy. She said. A decade on, she recently lost over st so that she could carry on and have a tenth baby for a single man with a donated egg, but is yet to become pregnant.  Laura who now weighs st explained: Having had nine babies, and definitely wanting more, I couldn’t risk a tenth baby whilst being so overweight because of the associated risk factors. Before starting the process, Laura gets to know the intended parents she is working with and stays in touch afterwards, adding that when the children are old enough they will be told how they were born. Once they are old enough they will know who I am and that they grew in my tummy. Laura adds. However there are misconceptions around surrogacy Laura says, including myths that surrogates make lots of money and concerns that they will become attached to the baby. People think I would be attached to the baby. Of course, I want to keep that baby safe, but you donapost have the same feelingstowards your own child when you are pregnant with someone aposs. She says.  Under UK law, surrogates cannot be paid except for reasonable expenses such as clothes and medication. In the UK, surrogacy is altruistic. Expenses are covered, such as travel and maternity clothes. Laura says, adding that some people ask funny questions like aposdo you know who you are doing it for apos. Yes, I would not have a baby for a stranger. she answers. But there are some concerns more personal to Laura as the number of children she has given birth to approaches double figures. Laura said: I do get asked that. It is a sensible question.  I would like to carry on helping people to have their family. If my body gets to the stage where it is struggling with pregnancy, orI get health problems or the birth is not going well, that is where a line will need to be drawn because my children need a mum.I never rule anything out, I play everything by ear. I have always coped well with pregnancy and have had straightforward births. Despite some initial shock and concern from her grandparents over her first surrogate baby, Laura says she has the full backing of her family, who would be surprisedshe stopped. Itaposs so normal to my family they would be shockedI wasnapost having more...my mum is my biggest support regarding surrogacy. She supports me in doing what I do. She added: Twelve years ago, when I first started to do it, they had a lot of misconceptions. They were a little bit shocked and thought I shouldnapost do it. They saw an amazing journey with the parents and how they were respectful of me.

Nikki Panner weighed more than  stonesand was unhappy in her own skin. She was desperate for some lovely pictures with her then-three-month-old daughter, but hated seeing herself. The -year-old mum had struggled with her weight and couldnapost look at herself.Nikki told MyLondon she had tried dferent diets and struggled to find one which worked for her.She said: I remember that Christmas We were taking photos, and I just did not like myself. In one photo, I hated myself in it. Iaposd been struggling with my weight for a few years at that point, I just wanted to feel happy.Following a suggestion from her mum, Nikki signed up to her local Slimming World group to begin her weight loss journey.Sheaposd tried many dferent diets in the past but never found one that worked for her, partly because sheaposd never really taken the time to cook for herself and her family, or spend time preparing nutritious, tasty meals. I barely cooked before, I never really took the time to, she explained. I [also] wasnapost really active at that point: Iaposd had a C-section and I had quite a bad recovery, so I couldnapost be too active. But I had time in the evening where I was able to just cook, so I found loads of Slimming World recipes that had what we call aposfree foodapos. I spent that time for myself cooking dinner for my family. Slimming Worldaposs aposfree foodsapos are healthy staples that make up the bulk of a nutritious meal, and members are encouraged to eat as much aposfree foodapos as they like, until they feel full. They include things like lean meat and meat replacements, fish, dairy, eggs, pasta, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit - the main healthy food groups that are incorporated into a balanced meal. Nikki, from Hillingdon, west London, said: It was just small changes in the foods I was eating, the way I prepared food, and it just fit into my lestyle. They were average meals that weaposd have every day beforehand, but I learned how to cook them better. I started to really enjoy it, to learn [how to cook], it taught me a lot long-term and changed the way I looked at food. No foods are banned, so I never felt like I was restricted, she added. When I joined [Slimming World] I was breastfeeding, and obviously I needed extra calcium and fibre so Slimming World added that into my plans, I never felt like I had to give up or sacrice anything - I could even have a chocolate barI needed to. As Nikki started to sht the pounds through enjoying a balanced diet of nutritious, filling meals - and still enjoying the odd treat to avoid unsustainable, restrictive dieting - she felt able to be more active and found it easier to move more. She began walking with her daughter as a relaxed way to exercise, and appreciated not feeling forced to go to the gym or endure strenuous exercise by her slimming plan. Her weight loss didnapost feel real until she saw photos of herself after losing around five stone. She noticed a stark dference in how she looked compared to the photos she hated from Christmas, and started to feel more confident in her own skin. After reforming her diet in January , by August Nikki had lost six stone, or  kilograms. This hasnapost only transformed her body image, but also her family le: losing the weight helped Nikki, who has polycystic oy syndrome , conceive her second child. Getting pregnant is dficult for people with PCOS, and one of the main symptoms of the condition is weight gain, which can make it even harder. Losing so much weight is, therefore, a twofold success for Nikki, who feels happier and healthier while getting ready to welcome another child into the world. My doctors said it was going to be really dficult for me [to get pregnant], but I think losing the weight really helped, she said.Iaposm already noticing a dference in this pregnancy : Iaposm going up the stairs so much quicker, I just feel more active, which is really nice.While Nikki continues her new lestyle, sheaposs also about to embark on a new career as a Slimming World consultant, helping other people achieve their goals - she couldnapost be more excited about her new job, or more proud of how far sheaposs come.

New York judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision on whether the Duke will face a full civil trial is expected soon. He has already decided there is no case to answer on the “domicile ­argument” over Ms Giuffre’s residency in Australia but a source has told the Mirror that Andrew’s legal team “are not taking this lying down”.  His lawyers believe they have found a new angle to stop Ms Giuffre’s case, as federal law explicitly bans two parties who are not US residents facing each other in court. The source said: “They believe they have a genuine argument to get this thrown out. If they can prove under federal law where Ms Giuffre has filed her case, that there is precedent not to bring a case where both parties are not US residents, then it should be halted immediately.” Ms Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions in , has lived in Australia since . Our source said: “Eventhe judge rules that there is a case for a full trial, there is a long way to go.”  The Duke’s attorney, Andrew Brettler, said Ms Giuffre was living in a £million home in Perth, Australia, when she filed her lawsuit and had spent less than two years in the US since moving to Australia in . The claimant’s team has a deadline of January  to prove -year-old Ms Giuffre’s residency status. Prince Andrew’s former we Sarah, , today declared it was “onwards and upwards” as she ed from a skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, at the £million chalet the Duke is having to sell to pay his legal bills, which have topped £million. The Duke has always “absolutely and categorically” denied the allegations against him. But the Queen will not pay her son’s costs and “would not assist” him in paying a financial ­settlement to Ms Giuffre.  It has been claimed a million – £.million – out of court settlement would be turned down by Ms Giuffre, leaving the Duke at risk of a far higher payouther case goes ahead in the autumn and is settled by a jury. Previously, Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer for some of Epstein’s victims, told the MirrorAndrew is found guilty the damages could “easily” top £million. He said: “A jury is not limited by anything. To punish somebody worth a billion dollars, you have got to hit them in their pockets and punish them accordingly.” If Judge Kaplan does decide that the case should go to trial, insiders have said the option to settle out of court “remains on the table”. One source said: “No discussions have been had regarding a financial settlement – the Duke wants to clear his name. “This is a US civil litigation, being fought in a US court with US lawyers – and given that the vast majority of US civil litigation is settled out of court, it would always remain an option on the table.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCrimeBillionairesDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However Amelie did not walk like her other friends and appeared to be very unsteady on her feet, prompting a long road of tests and invasive investigations. By age four, she was given the devastating diagnosis of a lelong motor neurone condition known as HSP. Rose said: “Itaposs a rare condition that affects only around .% of the population The condition affects her lower body muscles, causing them to be tight and weak. “It makes it incredibly dficult for her to walk and balance is a real struggle,I leave her for a second, she just falls. “She also has weak motor skills. There isn’t really one thing which is easy for her.” After the news and arrival of their second child, Saphie, Amelie and Jay felt overwhelmed and as they adapted their lives and home to Amelie’s needs. The pandemic also had a signicant effect on the family and Rose had to give up her job as a solicitor to take care of the girls. Rose said: “It’s really exhausting because we have to watch her constantly. “There’s the emotional side too. It’s really hard watching her struggle.” Although she attends four physiotherapy sessions a week, the eight-year-old lives in constant pain. Rose said: “She gets upset because she doesn’t understand why she has to do her stretches. “She doesn’t understand why her mummy is making her do something that hurts her.”  Because her condition is so rare, Amelie’s parents struggled to find much information online. Rose said: “After the diagnosis we joined so many online forums and support groups to ask questions. “I don’t know what we would have done without them.” Every day, Amelie has to use a walking frame and wears ankle splints. This exhausts her and she struggles signicantly to play with her friends and little sister, who she adores. Amelie is sadly not eligible for this surgery in the UK, however Dr Park in St Louis Childrenaposs Hospital, Missouri is confident the operation will change her le for the better. Rose said: “For a lot of children it’s absolutely le changing and has miraculous results. “Ultimately it’s going to sever the nerves in her spinal cord – the ones that are telling the muscles to be tight in her legs.” “There will be a long rehabilitation process afterwards, but we are hopeful and optimistic.” However, the procedure is costly. Dozens of generous donors have contributed to a GoFundMe page for the brave girl. £, is needed to fund the procedure and give Amelie the opportunity to live her le as independent as possible. Her family are now hoping to raise money to give their young daughter this chance of to transform her le. So far, nearly £, has been raised and the family are overwhelmed with the support and generosity of their friends. To reach their goal, the eight-year-old’s family and friends plan to participate in some active fundraisers in Spring. Rose said: “We like to do a lot of community-based stuff and things Amelie can be involved in.” “We even want to do a danceathon then Amelie can join in in her own way” “She would love to perform in a dance show one day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said some people may have already had a background level of protection against coronavirus.He told The Sun : I think they are present in quite a signicant number of people.So there is probably background T-cell immunity in people before they see the coronavirus, and that may be relevant that many people get a pretty asymptomatic disease.Those T-cells get a bit tired once youaposre beyond the age of  and may not be as effective at removing a virus, so that may explain a number of dferent features of the disease. Researchers in the UK and Brazil are reportedly studying whether it is possible some people might have a natural immunity which allows their immune systems to fight the virus.  A professor of medicine and immunology at Imperial College London, Danny Altmann, says the genes that control our immunity dfer hugely from one person to another.Referring to immunity, he told The : I’m talking about thousands of possibilities on your chequerboard no two people will ever look the same.One theory as to why some people may have natural immunity is that people could have been exposed to similar viruses before in the past, reports said. When T-cells learn how to fight a similar virus, it is believed they become better at fighting others. Some scientists suspect some people may just be born with immunity to certain viruses but this idea is less well researched and there is no clear evidence for this yet. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tested positive for coronavirus a day after a major speech setting out his vision for Britainaposs future. Sir Keir missed Prime Ministeraposs Questions, with deputy leader Angela Rayner stepping in to face Boris Johnson. The Labour leader previously tested positive for coronavirus on the day of the Budget in October.Sir Keir is not thought to have any Covid- symptoms but the infection was picked up as part of his regular testing routine. This latest positive test will mean it is the sixth period of self-isolation for the Labour leader since the start of the pandemic. A Labour spokesman said Sir Keir had been taking regular lateral flow tests.

John Brelsford embarrassed the vulnerable child at St Wilfrid’s Primary School, Sheffield, who was left “crying” after the incident.During the lesson, Mr Brelsford split his class by gender, and then asked some of the boys to switch sides to create equal teams, reports BirminghamLive. The teaching assistant then gave one of the boys a female name, and branded him a baby when he got upset. He had previously called pupils stupid and pathetic, aposscreamedand shouted at them. The then headteacher Delia Evans said: I am concerned that John doesn’t see that his conduct is unprofessional and what he is doing wrong, despite previous training and warnings. Employment Judge Chris McAvoy-Newns threw out the claim of unfair dismissal.  He added: I find that [Mr Brelsford] was dismissed for conduct and not because Mr Truby or Mrs Evans held a personal vendetta towards him. Although there are some suggestions that Mr Truby was losing patience with him a long time before January , had there been such a vendetta, I find that it is likely that they would have escalated the dismissal process much more quickly than they did. There were a signicant amount of incidents concerning [Mr Brelsford] from February . These concerned [his] behaviour towards children, in particular, the way he spoke to or interacted with them... Although none of the incidents giving rise to the disciplinary warnings were precisely the same, they all followed the same theme and concerned [Mr Brelsfordaposs] conduct with children which the [school] considered to be inappropriate.

Tyler Finnigan suffered le-changing injuries when he accidentally slipped onto the tracks at Motherwell train station in April last year. He was only  when he had to have his arm amputated after his hand was sliced off by the moving train.The teen, from Scotland, also suffered such severe head trauma that he was placed in an induced coma at Queen Elizabeth University, the Daily Record reports. Doctors put  staples into his wound and also saved his right ear by sewing it back on.  Tyler, now , has suffered severe mental health issues and has contemplated taking his own le since the accident. He is also devastated by the loss of his independence and haunted by traumatic night terrors. Dad Kevin, , is now trying to raise funds to buy him a state-of-the-art prosthetic arm to improve his quality of le. Tyler does not have enough bone in his limb to be able to use an NHS-issued prosthetic. Tyler said: I struggle with le on a daily basis. I canapost dress myself or tie my own shoelaces.  I need help getting in and out of the shower. I canapost do simple things, like cut up a potato or butter bread. The worst part is going outside because Iaposm so paranoid everyone is staring at me. I take panic attacks whenever I hear a train and I have night terrors about the accident. I feel like all my friends have abandoned me and Iaposm in constant pain. Iaposve contemplated suicide, but all I want is my independence - more independence than I have now. Getting a prosthetic arm that would help me do that, it would mean the world to me. Tyler had been looking forward to starting a mechanics course the week after his accident but his plans for the future became impossible as a result of his injuries. Kevin is desperate to help his son and is trying to raise money for an articial limb that works by recording electric signals - and they can cost up to £k. UK-based prosthetics firm Otto Bock currently offers the technology privately but the cost is priced per patient. Their articial limb, DynamicArm, is similar to others available in America made by companies such as Open Bionics and Mobius Bionics. The security guard said: Tyler has been struggling with his mental health and has been really low. It is heartbreaking for me to see him like this and feel like there is nothing I can do. A prosthetic arm that works will make a massive dference to his le. Iaposm concerned about his mental state of mind, he feels like Iaposve got to help him wash and get dressed. He gets so frustrated that he canapost put on his own shoes. Getting him this arm is so important, itaposll help him regain his independence. Iaposve been working all through Christmas to save as much as I can. Iaposve got epilepsy so Iaposm meant to be off sick as I still have seizures. But I want to see my boyaposs quality of le back again. Iaposll keep going until he gets the arm. We just need to take each day as it comes.Donations to help Tyler get the prosthetic arm can be made here. *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

The data is highly encouraging and emphasises the value of a booster jab, Wei Shen Lim, chair for COVID- immunisation on the governmentaposs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said in a statement.By comparison, with only two vaccine doses, protection against severe disease for the over-s dropped to around % after three months and to % after six months, the UKHSA said.The current data show the booster dose is continuing to provide high levels of protection against severe disease, even for the most vulnerable older age groups, Lim said.  For this reason, the committee has concluded there is no immediate need to introduce a second booster dose, though this will continue to be reviewed. Protection against mild symptomatic infection was more short-lived than against severe disease and dropped to around % after about three months, the UKHSA said.

The final outcome of his case is not yet known, but what fascinates me is sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell ’s little black book.As our brilliant US Editor Christopher Bucktin disclosed,  Brits appear in this secret contact directory. US law officials are reviewing more than , phone numbers and dozens of email addresses in search of further evidence. There are no allegations of wrongdoing against any of those named. There’s nothing criminal about appearing in somebody’s contacts book. When I was a political correspondent, mine contained the private details of Tory MPs and ministers. That didn’t make me one of them.But there was traffic. I would call them for a story, a quote or some background information. They were in there for a reason. The FBI sees these named Brits, including some lords and ladies, merely as “potential witnesses, unless the evidence leads them ­where”.Fair enough. But what are Tony Blair, mentioned once, and  of his former Cabinet members, doing in the little black book  Why is Lord Peter Mandelson in there with “home” and “country home” phone numbers This list tells me rich, powerful and influential people, from pop stars to presidents and politicians to princes, rubbed shoulders in an international Establishment of “the beautul people”. Lawyers at Maxwell’s sex trafficking trial agreed the little black book should not be made public. Nonsense. It already has been, at a case involving Prince Andrew’s rape accuser Virginia Giuffre. Let’s open this Who’s Who of the jet set, and ask them why they were persons of interest to Maxwell and her dead lover, paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Plan B doomed to fail The reality of the Government’s Plan B to combat surging Omicron transmission is now clear. It is an abdication of ministerial responsibility, a Do-It-Yourself strategy for the population, with these rules: Buy more masks, and wear them at all times, unless appearing on TV to save the Prime Minister’s face. Don’t go to the office, work from home, whether you get paid or not. Do get yourself vaccinated to boost the Tories’ flagging political fortunes. Don’t party with pals, except in work-related gatherings exempt from the rules, with permission from Downing Street. Travel abroad irresponsibly to facilitate the import of new virus iants. On demand, show your Covid pass to anyone in authority. These rules will be reviewed regularly to avoid a lockdown that would save lives, but upset the Covidiot wing of the Conservative Party. Any inquiries should be made to the Department of Lateral Flow Testing, Notmeguv House, Whitehall.  aposLevelling upapos So that’s what the Government means by “levelling up”. It’s about filling in potholes for former Tory peers. Viscount Pothole – I’m sorry, Gage – , got a £, grant from the Getting Building Fund to do up the driveway to his Firle Estate in East Sussex. Building back better! I hope his stately home doesn’t need redecorating because the Boris Wallpaper Finance Fund is running low.

I got up to go to the horse and sheaposs currently unwell, so sheaposs on box rest.  I was holding on to her lead rope and I lost my footing, I tripped on a pot hole or something and I fell. Blue can be quite flighty so I didnapost let go of her, so didnapost put my hands out to protect my face, and my whole face went straight into the kerb.” Abbi has owned the -year-old horse for four years and has won awards in show jumping competitions with her. She never thought she would sustain such a serious injury away from the arena. Now she has been left unable to feel her forehead entirely and is waiting to see the long-term damage left by the fall. Abbi said: It was really deep. I was dying to see what it looked like properly so my mum took a picture while I was sat in AE waiting for it to be stitched up. It was a deep gash from one brow straight into the other one. It went down to my eyelid as well and I have  stitches in there. There wasnapost any surgery but they gave me anaesthetic, though I couldnapost really feel anything anyway.” It took staff around forty minutes to stitch up, and the plastic surgeon checked all of her movements. Abbi had both eyes closed for two or three days and feared her sight may never . She added: I looked like a goldfish with golf ball eyes. A few of my friends have kindly said I look like an ant too.” I still donapost have feeling in my forehead but Iaposm hoping that will come back.” After three days, one of Abbiaposs eyes finally started to go down and she was able to film some videos for her followers to explain what had happened. Now she is sharing her story to warn other horse riders to stay safe even while off their horse - urging them to wear hats even when they think they are safely on the ground. Abbi said: One eye slightly opened and thataposs how I managed to make the TikToks and explain what was going on. Itaposs had about .million views which is almost the population of Scotland.  [Medical staff] said there would be a scar and it would affect my eyebrows. That was a bit of a worry as Iaposm into my make up. Even [when Iaposm] not wearing make up Iaposm a girly girl. I might have to get my eyebrows tattooed on or draw them on every day. The chances of injury when out show-jumping were high, but I never thought it would happen now. Since her accident, Abbi has resolved to stay optimistic and still hopes to ride her beloved Blue again in the future. Abbi said: Iaposd tell people to make sure they wear the correct footwear and even a hat. A lot of people donapost put their hat on while handling their horse on the ground, you just think everything will be fine. If Iaposd worn a hat my injury wouldnapost be as bad. Iaposm hoping to get back on board, Iaposm desperate to get on.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Horses\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

William Stewart, , and we Carol, , who were both unvaccinated, had been hospitalised after eight members of their family tested positive for Covid .The couple, from New Hampshire in the US were on le support for eight days, and two weeks, respectively, during which Mr Stewart suffered from lung, kidney and renal failures due to Covid complications.Their devastated family were initially only allowed to see them remotely using iPads but were allowed to gather around their beds, dressed head-to-toe in protective gear, as they both took their last breaths. Melissa Noke, one of the couple’s daughters, told the Boston Globe that her parents were inseparable and the true definition of apossoul matesapos. She explained how the hospital staff wheeled her parentsapos bed into the same room so they could die together. “Placed both beds side by side, placing my mother’s hand into my father’s hand,” she told WMUR. “As soon as they touched hands, my father took his last breath, and then my mother  seconds later.” Mrs Noke said her parents first met when Mr Stewartaposs mum babysat for Carol who was just four at the time. They lost contact but reconnected as adults, and within a year fell in love and got married before going on to have three daughters Melissa, Malissa and Melinda. They have also left behind seven grandchildren.  Mrs Noke said is planning to get the Covid jab and is urging others to so the same so they don’t have to endure the pain her parents went through in their final days. She said: “I just want people to get vaccinated, because you never know what tomorrow is going to bring. We want to spread the story as much as possible about their love story, and what happened to them.  Before the couple died on December  a crowdfundraiser was launched by their nephew Tim Stewart to pay for their medical bills as they did not have health insurance.He said in a post announcing their deaths, he wrote: They fought a long and hard battle with Covid, both intubated and on le support. We never really have enough time with our loved ones.

Itaposs no great surprise therefore that, after one forensic psychologist from the US took to Redditaposs Ask Me Anything forum, they were bombarded with questions about the more disturbing aspects of their job.Curious commenters were certainly not left disappointed, with the aposrelatively newapos professional opening up candidly about their line of work with all types of clients - including those who have committed murder. The unnamed inidual says they currently work at a conditional release program that provides therapy, case management and evaluations for those with severe mental illness.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. They explain these patients have previously been committed to the state hospital on account of the dangerousness of their offence and their aim is to bring them safely back into society. One of the main questions Reddit users had was whether or not people were aposevilapos by nature or because of apossociety parenting circumstancesapos. The forensic psychologist, who writes under the username u hippokuda, stated that they believe both things to be true, going on to address the dferences between psychopathy and sociopathy. They wrote: If you look at apospsychopathsapos vs apossociopathsapos thataposs an example of innate vs environment. Psychopathy is something people are born with and we can see neurological dferences that inhibit their ability to empathize with people. Whereas someone who is a apossociopathapos is not inherently born with it and behave in a way that could be a product of their environment . And you can see that they are able to empathize and have connections with people, but perhaps shaped in an antisocial lens. However, they went on to say they believe that even for the psychopaths itaposs still both, remarking that not everyone with psychopathy is a serial killer. Some of them participate in our society in socially acceptable ways . Even when you look at a lot of serial killers youaposll see that a lot of them have pretty signicant histories of trauma and abuse, they explained.For this particular forensic psychologist, the realisation that psychopathy can be found in aposeveryday peopleapos is the most interesting thing theyaposve learned so far, with the user remarking that they are always startled by just how aposnormalapos a lot of my clients present. They add that even when meeting people outside of work, they now canapost help but wonder how many gnarly people are out there that are flying under the radar.No doubt many of those whoaposve read the thread will now feel the same way.

This was devastating to my dad as my parents were best friends and started dating when they were , the man explained on Redditaposs AITA forum.I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mum. I was supposed to spend one week at my mumaposs then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my mumaposs. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house.  He added: My mum would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn’t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mum. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mum, but I couldn’t. My mum tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mum broke down and let me just live with my dad. The man hasnapost spoken to his mum since he as  and would even ask his dad to get her to leaveshe turned up to watch his games. She would try to speak to him at the end of matches and he would walk right past her without even acknowledging. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone  to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed, calling it the aposbiggest mistake of her leapos and begging my dad to forgive her, he continued. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fiancée Rachel was with me when I did this and my mum cried after learning we were engaged saying she couldn’t believe I hated her still this many years later. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Last week the man received a letter from his mum with a large cheque inside. In the letter she told him she couldnapost live with herself not being invited to her only sonaposs wedding and that the whole family is so upset theyaposve cut off. She also told him sheaposd been keeping tabs on him via his cousins. I ripped the cheque up and sent it back to theaddress. She shouldn’t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was  they have been providing my mum with updates on me prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address, he continued. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn’t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don’t want my mum getting access to it. Rachel is saying I’m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my mumaposs whole family because of her actions is an a**hole move. The man to Reddit to question whether he was taking it too far by uninviting his cousins. Acting out as a -year-old is to be expected. Deciding not to ever forgive your mum is totally your right , one Reddit user commented. The fact that you are still throwing tantrums like a -year-old, at the age of , makes you the a**hole. Another added: Why are you punishing your mum so severely  She made an awful mistake years ago, a mistake many parents do. They have a right to their own lives and moral failings. Honestly I would encourage you to explore why you feel this hatred for your mum that seems disproportionate. Punishing your cousins for showing compassion does seem like going too far.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The incredible home at Down End Point, a renowned beauty spot in North Devon, would see them make a drastic jump from their busy lives in London., with daughters Nicole and Lauren. And it wasnapost any ordinary style home . The five-bedroom house includes a four-storey tower from which inhabitants can gaze across the sea. It was set to include a further four bedrooms in the main body of the house, a sauna, a cinema and a ft glass-edged infinity pool with views over Croyde Bay. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Like every episode of Grand Designs, this one began with a sombre Kevin McCloud wearing a hard hat on site and warning the over-eager couple that they may have overstretched themselves. But Edward confidently told the TV presenter that they would be finished in just  months, and would spend no more than £. million. However, the project ended in disaster as the couple ended up splitting, while the family were plunged into millions of pounds of debt. But now the home has finally gone on the open market - for a whopping £M after Edward Short, , has spent a decade working on Chesil Clf House in a bid to get it up to scratch. The property featured on Channel aposs Grand Designs and was described as the saddest episode ever after it aired in October . And Mr Short hasnapost held back on what it has cost him personally, as he told thelast year: There’s no point in regrets, but obviouslyI had any idea of what it would cost the marriage and my family, I wouldn’t have done it. I had started it it’s not easy to back out of this. He added: There were quite a few days where I looked temptingly at the clf edge and thought le might be better down there, but that wouldn’t have helped anyone, would it  I couldn’t give up on that image I had of [the house].”  But despite all the problems, Edward remained adamant he would finish - and now estate agent Knight Frank has now announced the sale of the main house and its annexe known as The Eye. The estate agent described it as one of the most impressive waterfront homes on the North Devon coast. It comprises of five bedrooms and bathrooms, four reception rooms, a sauna and a cellar. The property will also include the three-bedroom studio annexe known as The Eye and double garage.  A Knight Frank spokesperson added: Chesil Clf House is positioned on a three-acre site between surfers’ paradise Saunton Sands backed by the impressive UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of Braunton Burrows, and the idyllic cove of Croyde, beyond which sits National Trust-owned Baggy Point. “Not only does the property boast high design and build quality, it also has a south-facing position and an ease of access to the water with a private beach and foreshore.” Christopher Bailey, Head of National Waterfront, Knight Frank, added: “Chesil Clf House will be the most signicant coastal property to come to the open market in the West Country for many years.  “It is iconic in the true meaning of the word and there is nothing  to compare it to on the market right now. “It certainly sits at the very top of the national coastal waterfront market and I have no doubt it will attract keen interest globally.” Edward said earlier the time was right to move on. He added: I’ll always be proud to have finished this. I owe it to my family to have a real end result, but the time has come to move on. I will have achieved what I set out to do, never deviating from the plans, and for that I’ll always be proud. The house has been anchored into the bed rock of the clf, painstakingly engineered to a level that leaves no possibility for erosional hazard. Edward said he had no option but to sell it to cover the large amount of money he had to borrow. He added: These past ten years have been a marathon slog - and I have got used to being a millionaire in debt. Iaposve accepted the only way forward is to finish and sell it.

This has been great and much appreciated and at first I thought she was happy to help out because she expressed how much she wanted a grandchild before my son was born. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Although the arrangement had been working well, the womanaposs mum has now started asking for money to babysit. She has recently said she now wants to be paid for looking after my son and is upset that we haven’t paid her at all, she continued. She did not indicate that she expected payment in the first place. The woman said that her mum pays no rent or money towards food and amenities, and has even gone on a few holidays with them as well, so she couldnapost help but be surprised when her mum brought up payment. If anything I’m more hurt that she feels this way, as my point of view us paying her feels like a transaction and not the fact that it’s her grandchild, the woman continued. I’m more than happy to pay for expenses that she might incur for looking after my son but in our case, there isnapost any because she lives with us. Butshe wants payment then I might as well take my son to a nursery when Iaposm back at work. The post sparked a debate among users as they argued who was in the wrong. Many people in the comments said her mum was unreasonable to ask for money when she lives in the house rent-free, as one person said: It seems strange that she’s asking to be paid for childcare when she’s living rent-free as a family member. Another said: Say yes - happy to pay you. At the same time, we set up the rental agreement for us housing you subsidising your living expenses and then we can knock it off what you owe us…! But others thought it was odd that she hadnapost been paying her. You assumed she was happy to do it for free infor room and board, one person wrote. Now you know this isnapost the case she will, of course, want to pay rent and you will, in turn, pay her for the childcare. While someone  said: I would pay her. It is hard looking after a -month-old all day every day. I think it is odd that you donapost. But a third person said: This type of request doesn’t come from thin air. She either feels like you’re using her and so has asked for payment to end the arrangement, or you or your [darling husband] may have accidentally insulted or offended her by mentioning the extras you do pay for. If she were truly happy with you and your family she would never have asked for money, so you do need to delve a bit deeper before having a go.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Weaposve all been there.But, while most of us have experienced the heartache of buying an out for a night out and it ending up being slightly too big or slightly too small - one womanaposs shopping disaster is in a league of its own. Kara Hall decided to treat herself to a plunging black sequinned wrap dress from Boohoo for her New Yearaposs Eve night out, and it happened to be an absolute bargain at just £... or so she thought. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the dress arrived and Kara tried it on, she released it wasnapost just plunging - it actually didnapost even cover the majority of her body.Taking to TikTok from the handle @karahall, Kara asked: What do I do  before adding in the comments section: Raise your handyou’ve been personally victimised by Boohoo Judging by the comments section, it seems like an awful lot of people were raising their hands, as dozens of TikTok users revealed they had also ordered the exact same dress and found the same fault. Nooo way, I ordered this and it looked the exact same on me, I was mortied. I had to send it back, one TikTok user commented, while another added: Omg I bought this too and sent it back for the exact same reason! Fortunately, Kara confirmed she had been able to alter the dress herself in the comments section, meaning it wasnapost a complete waste and she didnapost find herself without a New Yearaposs Eve outfit.

The Grfin sank to the murky depths of Lake Michigan during its maiden voyage in  while carrying a precious cargo of furs. Rumours say fearful natives had cursed it after a prophet from the native North American Iroquois tribe told French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle to beware Darkness like a cloud.. to envelop you. La Salle had hoped to find a route through the lakes to somehow reach the distant shores of Japan and China. Since vanishing, it was held as the holy grail for shipwreck hunters keen to unlock a piece of history. La Salle, who was not on board for the fateful voyage, never found out what happened to the ship.  But before it departed, Metiomek, an Iroquois prophet, apparently told him: Beware! Darkness like a cloud is ready to envelop you. The Christian Indianaposs curse rests on you and on your great canoe. She will sink beneath the deep waters and your blood shall stain the hands of those in whom you trusted!Steve and Kathie Libert, a husband and we team, determined that a wreck found in  was likely that of the mysterious Grfin, reports the Express. Mr and Mrs Libert claim The Grfin matches the wreckage which was found in  near Poverty Island in Lake Michigan. Native traditions say The Grfin became a ghost ship, and the the crew can still be heard chanting as she sails among the clouds under the light of the moon. But the wreckage suggests the most plausible theory was that the ship was lost in a storm, and the cargo furs, estimated at up to , at the time– £, in modern day money – sank with her. The bowsprit is believed to have broken off and sank a few miles before the rest of the ship went down.  Carbon dating studies of the bowsprit put the age of ship within a year of the boataposs construction. Mr Libert said: There are numerous theories as to what happened to The Grfin. Father Louis Hennepin said it was lost in a violent storm. Some say that the native Indians boarded the ship and killed the crew. They then set the ship on fire. Many believed the Jesuits were responsible for the shipaposs disappearance. La Salle was certain that the captain and his men committed mutiny, sank the ship and absconded with all the furs.  Many believed the Jesuits were responsible for the shipaposs disappearance. La Salle was certain that the captain and his men committed mutiny, sank the ship and absconded with all the furs. Mr Libert added: “The ship has no indications of fire damage to the wooden remains. We are confident the ship was wrecked due to a severe storm. “The distance of . miles between the bowsprit and main sections highly suggests the Indians did not sink it either, nor did La Salle’s men mutiny and sink the ship. “If any of the latter was true the ship would rest in deeper water instead of shallow waters.”  The Grfin, Mr Libert believes, was caught in a four-day storm. Carbon dating of the bowsprit estimated an age range within a year of The Grfin’s sinking in . The other nearby wreckage, meanwhile, had been dated to between  and . Mr Libert addded: Both the Seneca and Iroquois felt threatened by the construction and sight of Le Grfon, and felt that it was a threat to the aposGreat Spirit.  The Seneca were in awe of the French for having built such a large canoe. They were concerned for their safety in as much that they tried to burn the ship during construction. Mr Libert explained the discovery had been long in the making, sparked by a history teacher when he was still at school. He said: “My interest began the day my teacher reached over and touched my shoulder, and said out loud in class, ‘Maybe one day, someone in this class will find it.’ “Fty-one years later, I am still intrigued by this story.”  Yet the battle to find The Grfin has been riddled with issues. After the discovery of the bowsprit, a -year legal battle with the State of Michigan prevented explorers from excavating the rest of the ship. Only then did Mr Libert and ious archaeologists discover that the bowsprit and the remainder of the vessel were separate. After two years sting through satellite imagery, Mr Libert found what he believed was the rest of the wreck, and this was later confirmed in a September  e. He recalled: “I was emotionally drained of all my energy, and was in a complete state of relief and exhaustion, but I could still yell out the words ‘We found it!’ once I broke the surface.”  The State of Michigan continues to prevent an in-depth excavation. According to Mr Libert, the state “feels we are encroaching upon their sovereignty and feels we are nothing more than treasure hunters intruding on the rights of academia and archaeologists”. Mr Libert will continue to search the bed of Lake Michigan using non-intrusive techniques, with the ultimate aim of finding a cannon with the date stamped on it. The Liberts have since written a book about their findings, Le Grfon and the Huron Islands – : Our Story of Exploration and Discovery.

A probe is underway to find out how Mr Mandal, who lives with his family in Madhepura district, managed to get multiple jabs.Amarendra Pratap Shahi, civil surgeon of Madhepura, told the BBC : aposWe have already found evidence that he took eight jabs from four places. India largely administers two locally-manufactured vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, with more than , centres offering jabs across the country. Camps offering walk-in jabs without prior online registration require proof of identity to register for a jab. Mr Mandal reportedly managed to take two jabs in a half hour gap on the same day.  Mr Shahi added: We are flummoxed how this could happen. There seems to be a portal failure happening. We are also trying to find out whether there was any negligence by people manning the vaccination centres. Public health expert Chandrakant Lahariya told the BBC that the only way this can happen isthe vaccination data from the sites is uploaded on the portal after a long lag.

Brooks Nader, a Sports Illustrated model living in New York, shared her bizarre experience on social media after receiving a notication on her iPhone that an unknown AirTag had been “moving with her for a while”. The notication, which popped up just after pm on Wednesday night, told her that the owner of the device could “see its location”. After checking her pockets, the -year-old realised the tracker, which was designed to locate easily mislaid items like keys, had been slipped into her coat pocket. It wasn’t until several hours after she left the New York bar that she realised it was with her. Ms Nader posted on social media after realising that whoever had planted the tracker, would have been able to follow her home. In an Instagram story, she called out Apple, asking the tech giantthey took into consideration the “danger and potentially fatal consequences this device has”.“Ladies, check your bag, coat, pockets, and surroundings,” she added. “Disturbed isn’t even the word.” In another post, she discussed the dangers of posting one’s location while out and about - something she said she learned “the hard way”. “If you’re going to post at a restaurant, drinking with your girlfriends, working out, whatever you’re doing —it has a location that’s obvious or geotagged, wait until you leave to post it,” she said. “I have made that mistake so many times and it’s very easily avoidable. Just wait until you’re home or you’re walking home or whatever until you post that.”The model told Mail Online that her coat had been sitting on the barstool at the Odeon in TriBeCa, which had been her first location of the night.“I went to bathroom left my coat on the chair and that’s when I think someone slipped it in,” she said. “They then followed me for five hours all the way home.” Ms Nader said she never thought anything like this could happen to her. “I hope that my story can help raise awareness and encourage ladies to look out for this notication and keep their belongings close, especially when out and about.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AppleTribecaSports IllustratediPhone\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The elite soldiers are being sent in supposedly as part of a Moscow-led regional peacekeeping force from former Soviet countries but have a reputation for aggression. It came as President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev claimed foreign-trained terrorists were responsible for the unrest, paving the way for a ruthless clampdown. He warned on Friday that he has given a “shoot to kill” order to his police and military, more than  of whom have been slaughtered, three of them beheaded, in rioting.  It is feared scores of protesting civilians have been killed by a security clampdown as Moscow-loyali Tokayev has bowed to Putin’s offer of help. He said: The militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them. Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning. On Friday in Almaty gunfire could still be heard.  Buildings have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence in the country’s  years of independence.Moscow said more than  planes were ferrying Russian troops into Kazakhstan, and that these were now helping control Almatyaposs main airport,recaptured on Thursday from protesters.Demonstrations that began as a response to a fuel price hike have swelled into a broad movement against the government and ex-leader Nursultan Nazarbayev ,, the longest-serving ruler of any former Soviet state.  He turned over the presidency to Tokayev three years ago but his family is widely believed to have retained influence in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital that bears his name. Moscowaposs swt deployment demonstrated Putinaposs readiness to use force to maintain influence in the former Soviet Union, at a time when he has also alarmed the West by massing troops near Ukraine, whose Crimean peninsula Russia seized in . The mission falls under the umbrella of the Collective Security Treaty Organization - the CSTO - comprising Russia and five ex-Soviet allies.

Keep warm and decide whether youll be able to turn back, find shelter or stay where you are and call for help.It is a good idea to let a responsible person know the details of where you are going and what you are doing.Having the right kit is essential not only to keep you warm and dry but to keep you safe. The kit you buy, and use should reflect the type of activity that you intend to do and the conditions you may face.Outdoor shops will be able to provide you with advice on what you may need. The following list details the essentials for general hillwalking:Wear well-fitting boots suitable for the terrain you will walk on and the activity you plan to do. Gaiters may be beneficial for areas that are particularly boggy or where ticks may be present.A layered system of clothing is always best as you can adjust for the temperature better. The base layer should wick away the moisture with an insulating mid-layer and a breathable waterproof jacketand trousers.A hat and gloves should be packed also. Avoid any materials that may absorb water e.g. cotton T-shirt or jeans. If possible, wear clothing, especially a waterproof jacket that is a bright colour, so that you can easily be found in the event of an emergency.Always, always have a map and compass and know how to use it. Smartphones or GPS are excellent navigation aids but should not be relied on solely. Make sure you have the right map for the area you are walking in and check that your compass is working each time before you set off.Only use a rucksack big enough for the items that you will need. You may have to keep the contents in a waterproof bagthe rucksack is not waterproof..removeA whistle, head torch , survival bag, group shelter, first aid kit and mobile phone are essential. If you walk on your own, consider using a Personal Locator Beacon.Walking poles are very useful as they save energy and limit damage to the knees. Don’t forget to pack according to the weather so a sun hat, sun glasses and sun screen along with midge repellent net should be packedappropriate. Take enough food for the whole of your journey and have some packed as emergency rations. Carry a water bottle. You will usually be able to top this up from mountain streams, but it’s best to check availability in advance so you don’t run short.Winter conditions in Scotland are prevalent for many months of the year. Additional items may be required such as extra clothing, helmet, ice axe, crampons, winter boots and avalanche equipment."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-records-900-cases-weekend","story":"THE Borders recorded almost , cases of coronavirus over the New Year.According to figures released at pm todayby the Scottish Government, between New Years Eveand today,  cases of COVID- were recorded in the region.The total number of cases in the Borders now stands at ,.:Driver of car involved in A crash near Galashiels dies in hospitalThere are currently  people in hospital in the Borders with recently confirmed COVID- – an increase of six since Friday.Hospital figures for January  and  will be released on Wednesday .The total number of cases in Scotland stands at , and there are , in hospital nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"unwanted-christmas-presents","story":"ADVICE Direct Scotland, the country’s national advice service, has been running a Christmas campaign to remind shoppers of their consumer rights when ing or exchanging unwanted Christmas gts.From purchasing the wrong size of jumper to receiving two copies of the same book, the post-Christmas period results in lots of requests for refunds or gt swaps.The Consumer Rights Act gives everyone the legal right to either get a refund for goods that are of unsatisfactory quality, unfit for purpose or not as described, or to get a repair – depending on how long the items have been owned.Consumers also have more rights when shopping online and for most online s the regulations state that you can cancel an online order up to  days after receiving it, followed by a -day period in which you can send it back.Consumer rights include:The legal right to either get a refund for goods that are of unsatisfactory quality unfit for purpose or not as described or to get a repair – depending on how long you’ve owned it.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls own natural winter wonder","story":"Hair ice is a type of ice that forms on dead wood and takes the shape of fine, silky hair.It is believed to be caused by a fungus and occurs in hard and dead wood, although the reason behind its formation remains unclear.The conditions for hair ice to occur are fairly specic, requiring just the right temperature, moisture and wood type – and it seems that the #temperate rainforest# of Argyll provides just that.Dr Phil Anderson from the Scottish Association for Marine Sciencefirst noticed hair ice when he moved to Taynuilt from Cambridge  years ago and has begun looking into the phenomenon.He said: #Hair ice is not that common butyou want to find it, Argyll is about as good a place as anywhere in the world.#I first noticed it in my garden there was this fragile bit of ice sitting in the sunshine where it shouldn#t have been. I#ve since seen it up Glen Lonan and other places locally.#I#ve worked in Antarctica and studied how snow hardens but I found hair ice formation absolutely fascinating. It#s just weird!#Dr Dorothee Gotz works at Lallemand Aquapharm, which has a lab at SAMS, and shares an interest in hair ice formation.Lallemand Aquapharm holds a culture collection that includes fungus and, as a microbiologist, Dr Gotz recognised that the fungus responsible for hair ice formation would be worth including in the collection.She said: #I saw hair ice for the first time three years ago in Sutherland#s Grove, so I took a sample to add to our collection.#It#s a fascinating bit of microbiology. A fungus that forms ice and degrades wood is certainly of interest and could potentially have industrial applications.#Both scientists are keen to find out why this phenomenon occurs but say there is very little published literature on it, perhaps because it is so rare.#We don#t know what#s in it for the fungus,# explains Dr Gotz. #It needs to expend a lot of energy to create the hair ice and there is no apparent benefit to doing this.#Water is a problem for micro-organisms when it freezes, as ice can puncture the membrane. Perhaps the fungus is trying to expel the water before it becomes a problem.#Hair ice is most likely to form on dead wood with no bark. It also forms on certain trees more than others and prefers hard woods such as birch.#As a rough guide,the gritters are out, then hair ice might be out too,# said Dr Anderson. #You’re most likely to find it on a crisp, sunny morning after a clear night. The temperature has to be just below freezing.#If you have those conditions, keep your eyes peeled for frost or ice that shouldn#t be there.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

petrol station already there and replace it with “an enhanced roadside services offer” which would be open  hours as part of the redevelopment of Monktonhall Services.A drive-thru coffee shop will also be built on the site as part of a separate plan which has received the green light from the council.The former Travelodge building has been demolished and a new hotel is no longer planned.The new development would have an increased focus on HGVs, including a standalone refuelling area for trucks and lorries comprising two pumps.There would be a secure parking and rest area for HGVs, complete with a shower and toilet block for drivers’ use.This facilities block would be formed from a former tourist information block on the site.This parking area would have space for up to  large vehicles.A new petrol filling station – including a retail kiosk and forecourt including six pumps, three jetwash bays and two air vac water bays – is a key part of the plans.Eight charging points for electric vehicles would also be created.There would also be a bin store, car and cycle parking and landscaping, and an internal road layout is planned at the site which is located at the junction of the A, Edinburgh City bypass and B.A supporting statement, issued on behalf of the company by chartered surveyors and property consultants Graham + Sibbald LLP, said: “The proposal will redevelop the established services to modernise the existing offer on-site.“The enhanced facilities are intended to react to current and predicted trends in the roadside industry such as increased demand for EV charging points and the provision of a safe place for HGV drivers to rest and refuel to support the haulage and logistics sector.“In this way, the site will develop economic resiliency and be future-proofed for these coming trends.”And it added: “The principal vehicle access to the site will remain in its current location, where vehicles access the site from the southeast corner via the internal one-way system. Site egress will remain at the roundabout to the northwest of the site.“This internal road layout will also be used by vehicles exiting from the adjacent site to the east that has recently received planning consent for a drive-thru coffee shop.”The coffee shop, with a floor area of  square metres, would provide hot food and drinks and would have drive-thru facilities, as well as outdoor and indoor seating areas, and toilets.Open seven days a week from am to pm, it is earmarked to provide employment for  to  full-time staff.Thirty-eight parking spaces, four of which would provide electric vehicle charging points, and a motorcycle parking area are planned.Graham Wilson MRICS, MFG’s property director, said: “Motor Fuel Group is excited about the proposed development of our BP station at Monktonhall.“Improved parking facilities for HGV drivers, shop and ‘food to go’ offerings for customers and the addition of an EV charging hub with eight ultra-rapid chargers will be a great asset to the local area.“As soon as final planning approval is given, we will start the redevelopment [we are] hoping to complete in .”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said of the plans: “I welcome the proposals to replace the current facility and the job creation which comes alongside that.“We know that HGVs are vital for our supply chain and the dedicated rest space for HGV trucks in this area will assist the sector greatly in many respects.”Kenny MacAskill, MP for East Lothian, said: “The current site is looking rather dilapidated and a replacement can only be of benefit.“The jobs will be an additional benefit but hauliers and travellers will welcome it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10-school-classrooms-go-virtual-covid-cases-rise-east-lothian","story":"Schools opened their doors following the festive break but staff shortages, due to Covid-, meant some classrooms were empty.Wallyford Primary School and Pencaitland Primary School were among schools with classes that did notin person, while a class at Ross High School ASN base was also learning remotely from home.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: “The majority of our schools have ed to in-person teaching.“However, due to the impacts of teaching staff self-isolating, a number of pupils are temporarily learning at home.“This mainly affects children in primary school and a small number of our specialist communication bases.“All of our schools have contingency plans in place so they can make the move to remote learning quickly and are grateful for the support of their families.

And the show features a certain number of expletives and hard-hitting humour.But of course, a show wouldn’t have become so successfulit simply took a chainsaw to the head that is the Mormon belief system and buried it in a shallow grave.What the writers do cleverly however is hold the religion’s unusualness up for examination, the unrelenting geniality of its elders who walk the globe, chatting on doors and hoping to convert people with unrelenting amiability. “We grew up with Mormons, and their MO is to beat you by being kinder than you and higher than you,” Parker explained.The storyline follows two Mormon salesmen, the highly strung Elder Price and dumpy, lying Elder Cunningham, who are sent out to convert Uganda.And so, we have a great narrative, a journey blocked by defiance, disbelief and dismay. How can you convert African villagers into believing that this American wealth machine can work in a world where people are struggling to feed themselves  How can you knock on doors made of wattling The writers make the most of this impossible task, and without giving too much away, we see Price and Cunningham sell their religion via cures for AIDS, which involves having sex with amphibians.It’s naughty. It’s at times outrageous. It has great songs. Yet, it doesn’t mock God at all.

A critically ill car crash patient who happens to test positive on admission can result in a whole area of intensive care being sealed off.An elderly person who contracts the infection while in hospital for other treatment might take much longer to recover a bed that might have been freed up in two or three days ends up occupied for two weeks.These are the real reasons why Omicron is pushing the NHS to breaking point.: Covid is spreading faster than we can test for it - but the infection threat is very dferent to March Cutting self-isolation from  to seven days - the other major change announced this week - should mean that a majority of Covid positive people canto work three days earlier. But it won’t apply to everyone.To be clear, self-isolation can only end on day seventhe person has no fever and tests negative on days six and seven.NHS staff absences due to Covid have rocketed Evidence suggests that roughly % of people will remain infectious by day seven, and the vast majority of these iniduals will test positive on an LFD. If so, they must remain in isolation for the full  days.As Professor James Chalmers, an expert in respiratory medicine at Dundee University, put it: \"If you don’t take a lateral flow test,you just exit self-isolation at day seven, the modelling suggests a % risk that you are still infectious, so anybody who cheats these rules is putting others at risk.”It is easy to understand why vulnerable people feel worried.But with Omicron spreading faster than our testing capacity can cope and critical public services, from railways to care homes, struggling to stay afloat, Nicola Sturgeon has signalled the Scottish Government’s intention to “adapt our thinking about how to manage the virus”.This is not about “giving up on trying to control Covid completely”, she insisted, but facing up to the fact that “the kind of measures that have helped us control transmission in past phases are becoming less tolerable and causing more harm”.By the end of November, overall hospital admissions were around % lower than pre-pandemic averages - up from around % lower at the beginning of the pandemic. Figures for December have not yet been published Before Omicron emerged, leaked documents relating to an exit strategy dubbed ‘Operation Rampdown’ revealed how the UK Government might wind down its pandemic response.The -page dossier envisioned an end to the legal requirement for those infected with Covid to self-isolate dismantling Test and Trace and scrapping free PCR and lateral flow tests.“We will no longer be prioritising the previous objectives of breaking chains of transmission at all costs,” it stated.: Sturgeon announces key changes to testing and isolation rulesOmicron has scuppered this for now, but mass testing and mandatory self-isolation will end.PCR testing is already being rationed to key workers and the symptomatic. Eventually it will be limited, as was at the beginning, to hospital patients.Lateral flows will stop being an everyday tool to gauge whether you are safe to socialise or work, but might remain important for entry into certain high-risk settings such as care homes or hospitals.Work is already advancing on the next generation of rapid DIY Covid tests, with a new saliva swab trialled in Singapore reportedly achieving PCR levels of accuracy in minutes.Self-isolation will probably be scrapped next for those who are positive but asymptomatic and fully-vaccinated, before gradually being abandoned altogether.Covid cases have shot up, particularly since Christmas Eve How exactly we get there depends on a tricky trade-off of risks, but increasing use of oral antivirals which can stop Covid progressing from infection to serious disease will be one part of the equation.If we’re lucky, the virus itself will evolve over time into something much milder, but Omicron-specic vaccines could get us there faster.The real Holy Grail would be a vaccine which not only cut hospitalisation risk, but stopped infections, as this would truly end the pandemic.Many consider this highly unlikely - maybe even unnecessary.However, scientists in San Francisco are currently working on intranasal vaccines - where a shot is inhaled through the nose instead of injected into arms - on the basis that triggering the mucosal immune system might prevent the virus invading the respiratory tract in the first place.There is no doubt we are at a crossroads in the pandemic, however.If managing the eruption of Covid vexed governments, navigating a safe path out poses the biggest challenge yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13360584.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-star-lulu-pays-tribute-hollywood-legend-sidney-poitier","story":"Posting on her Instagram page, the Scots star said: \"Sidney you were my friend, my teacher, my inspiration….“Sir rises above the fray and leads by example”…this was how you lived your le.\"You empowered and educated us do we could choose to follow your lead!

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When I look back to my youth,you remember there was a computer called the Spectrum. I remember the FA Cup. On the game on the Spectrum I played in the FA Cup and it was the first trophy I won on the computer.“I want to play in the final, I want to play at Wembley. We will do everything in our hands to do that and it starts on Sunday. We start on the right foot in the competition.“I come with a big ambition to win titles for Wolves, that’s my target. I have won titles before and I came here with that ambition.“We have good players to do something amazing this season.”Lage is expected to make some changes against the Blades. John Ruddy is likely to deputise for Jose Sa in goal, while the likes of Ki-Jana Hoever and Fabio Silva could also be handed rare starting places.Rayan Ait-Nouri is fit again after a groin problem and the French defender could get his first outing for a month.Hwang Hee-chan , Willy Boly , Jonny Castro Otto , Yerson Mosqueraand Pedro Netoremain out.Lage, a former assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday, may not make too many changes, however, with his team having played only once since December .“It is an opportunity for us to continue in our way and be consistent. In the last three games we have played well and we need to continue with that mentality,” said the Portuguese.“The cup is big in the history of football and we will go with our strongest team.“Now you can watch any English game all around the world, but a long time ago there was only one to watch – the FA Cup final. It was the one English game on Portuguese TV. It is an important trophy not only here, but also around the world.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are open,” he said.“I think with the amount of things and the way we want to evolve the squad, we have to maximise every window in many dferent ways.“We are alert.Edu and his team are working very hard because we know exactly what we need to do.“Whether we can accomplish that in January or the summer is a dferent question and related to lots of other stuff but we are there.”Thomas Partey and Mohamed Elneny being on international duty, coupled with Ainsley Maitland-Niles joining Roma on loan, has left Arsenal light in midfield.💬 \"When a player feels this way and has a strong argument, it’s very dficult to turn it away.\"🎙 @MArteta— ArsenalJanuary , Yet Arteta again ruled out signing ex-Gunner Jack Wilshere, who has trained with the club in recent months but only to maintain fitness and expand his coaching knowledge.The Spaniard added: “I was very clear with the situation with Jack and the role that he would have being around here. We continue in the same way.”Arsenal’s lack of alternatives in midfield particularly for the month of January could have been solved by keeping Maitland-Niles until the end of the month when Partey and Elneny would have ed from Africa Cup of Nations duty.But Arteta insisted: “We are very, very short but to be fair on a player this cannot be the only argument to try to keep a player.“A player who has been developed and raised through our academy, a player who has been very patient in many moments to try and fulfil his dream.“He was very straight with me and I understood the situation. We think it is a good option. Obviously we are going to move and look for options because we are very short there.”One solution for Sunday’s clash with Forest would be to drop attacker Emile Smith Rowe into the centre of midfield alongside Granit Xhaka.The Arsenal number  has played there this season and was used regularly in that position during his loan spell at Sky Bet Championship club Huddersfield in .What a year 💫 Thank you for all your support.🤍 pic aDUNTk— Emile Smith RoweDecember , Smith Rowe has scored nine times for the Gunners during the current campaign but only started one of their last seven games.Arteta explained: “Well the main reason was because he wasn’t completely fit to play. He’s been carrying an issue and that hasn’t allowed him to train regularly, to play regularly and that was the main reason.“Because in his performances and what he did before that international break, there is no question that he was one of our more important and consistent players.“Obviously now that the team has been doing well, there are other players who are doing well and have been performing well, that changed the situation, but I am very happy with him.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

A second line next to the marker T is a sign of a positive result.However, many people have reported a faint second line on their test result, while others have seen a bold line after testing positive.As part of the Executive’s efforts to reduce the transmission of the Omicron iant, the public has been encouraged to take an LFT, otherwise known as a rapid antigen test, before leaving home.New rules around those who test positive for the virus has seen the isolation period cut from  days to seven — but onlyyou test negative on day six and day seven using a LFT.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and , new cases reported over the New Year periodFully vaccinated close contacts must also test themselves every day during that period.As a result of the increase in demand for LFTs, there is a shortage of the home testing kits and a lack of available slots for PCR tests at Northern Ireland’s drive through sites.Queen’s University virologist Dr Connor Bamford said that no matter how faint the T line may be, you are more than likely carrying the virus, and booking a PCR is vital as it is the “gold standard” when confirming the presence of Covid-.“The LFTs measure roughly the amount of virus in the sample,” he explained. “The amount of that colour is roughly proportionate to how much virus you#ve got in that sample.“A bigger, bolder line means more virus and a fainter line might mean less virus.“However, in both cases you#re likely to be infected. If the LFTs pick up anything, you are very, very likely to be infected.“In a couple of hours it can go from very faint to very, very bold and so in both those cases you probably have enough virus to spread that on so you should be isolating and booking a PCR to confirm that.“If you#re seeing a faint band you should be treating it as positive. You are positive, you are infected, soyou can see anything on that LFT you should treat it like it is Covid and you should isolate.”Dr Bamford said LFTs tell who is most likely to be contagious and infectious and are a great tool in the fight against Covid as they are so easy to use.“LFTs are very helpful and very reliable especially looking at asymptomatic people and looking at who is more likely to be contagious,” he added.UK Government advice on LFTs states “even faint lines” shows a test is positive.“Lateral flow tests used by the UK Government go through a rigorous evaluation by the country’s leading scientists,” the official guidance says. “This means they are accurate, reliable and successfully identy those with Covid- who don’t show symptoms and could spread the virus without realising.Lateral flow tests are not being offered in isolation, but alongside a range of other measures to drive down cases and break chains of transmission.”Most ReadComber family home is bright and beautul‘Hearty applause’ for Royal Mail after service delivers letter to Co Antrim man using just his descriptionWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean Elderly man dies after taking ill aboard a Belfast city busFuneral of man stabbed in Downpatrick to be a ‘celebration of all the good things he stood for’Top VideosPlayVideo: Meet the couple that inspired the song #Carrickfergus Girl#PlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport PlayKate and Will pull pints behind the bar in Empire Music HallLatest CoronavirusPolitical games overshadowing our education crisis, says DUPUnder strain: Six key areas where Covid staff shortages are affecting essential servicesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: , positive cases and no further deathsCovid situation is ‘dire’ in Northern Ireland schools, says teaching unionLatestRising Man City star Cole Palmer must be ready to seize chance – Rodolfo BorrellAvian malaria outbreak kills around % of Humboldt penguin colony at Dudley ZooDenise Van Outen announces separation from long-term partner Eddie BoxshallNew David Bowie waxwork to mark late singer’s th birthday at Madame TussaudsMedia watchdog asks India to release Kashmiri journalist,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During this time some members expressed concerns about his behaviour. He was living in a staunchly loyalist area of Carrickfergus while claiming to be a committed republican.At that stage he claimed to be an airline pilot. Questions were asked of employees of the same airline company and just as with his previous story about being a paratrooper, no one had ever heard of him.Around  McFadden was transferred by the company he was working for and became manager of a bar in west Belfast frequented at the time by dissident republicans.Those opposed to Sinn Fein’s political strategy and the  Good Friday Agreement were considered persona non grata in the republican-owned social clubs of west Belfast.The bar on the Falls Road where McFadden worked was frequented by dissidents, including one of the founding members of the Real IRA, Tony TC Catney.Catney died of cancer in . He was often seen in the company of McFadden who ingratiated himself with several republican causes.The New IRA is currently in disarray with blame being levelled at members from Belfast and Tyrone who were conned by McFadden.That rt is expected to deepen with the news that loyalists and later Sinn Fein members were able to quickly establish McFadden’s fake cover stories, yet the Real IRA and later the New IRA welcomed him into their ranks and elevated him to a position in which he was able to destroy the organisation from the inside out.Promoted to a member of Saoradh national executive, McFadden held the post of resource officer and was also involved in the financing of the party.His outing as an informer has led to questions about who was pulling the strings and where donations to the party were in fact coming from.McFadden claimed to know sympathetic businessmen donors — in fact this was all being controlled by British intelligence.In August  the eight men and two women were arrested following an MI-led operation which saw meetings arranged by McFadden in Co Tyrone in February and July of that year bugged by the intelligence services.The two houses were fitted with video and audio equipment and those present were recorded talking about what were alleged to be New IRA plans to obtain weapons and target Shannon airport for attack.They are also alleged to have talked about targeting a well-known Tyrone republican, claiming he had retained weapons that they wanted. Since then both the New IRA and Saoradh have been in a state of freefall.Among those now in the firing line are former north Belfast Saoradh member Dee Fennell, who was a regular at McFadden’s house where he had built a bar in an extension to the property.The home bar which was also bugged was frequented by Fennell and a number of others during the lockdown when hospitality was closed.Eyebrows were raised about the close nature of the relationship with the MI informer after he fled the Glengormley property last August. Fennell was not among those arrested despite being in McFadden’s company on a regular basis, however, he announced in July last year he was leaving Saoradh for “personal reasons”.A second north Belfast man who provided a vehicle used to transport people to and from the Co Tyrone meetings and who attended at least one of the gatherings and was present inside the house for a time has also never been arrested.Republican sources say this man was named as an informer in documents stolen from Special Branch headquarters at Castlereagh in .In March  some newspapers carried articles claiming that Tony Catney was a special branch informant, the information was said to be in the form of an anonymous letter from a former RUC man.However, the information against Catney had in fact been leaked by his former comrades in the Provisional IRA, and also came from confidential documents stolen in the Castlereagh break-in.Catney managed to shrug off the allegations as dirty tricks and the high level endorsement from the former IRA prisoner allowed McFadden to continue infiltrating the Real IRA.Sources say Catney had hatched plans for a republican supergroup, but they never came to fruition.In July  the RIRA merged becoming the New IRA. It was not the supergroup that had been planned but it did involve a collection of republicans from Belfast, Derry, Tyrone and Armagh.Catney was the New IRA’s ‘chief of staff’ — the organisation’s commander — responsible for directing ‘military operations.’McFadden by this stage was at times living with Catney in his west Belfast home, an agent at the highest level in the new republican terror group.McFadden told members of Saoradh he worked as a hotel safety inspector and owned shares in a bar in the Canary islands and used this as a cover for his frequent disappearances.He had also involved himself in a campaign launched on behalf of John Paul Wootton and Brendan McConville, who were jailed for the murder of police officer Stephen Carroll who was shot dead in March .McFadden attended court on the day the two Lurgan men were found guilty of the murder, accompanied by Catney and Mandy Duffy, also known as Amanda McCabe, who is one of those currently on remand facing terrorism charges linked to the MI bugging operation.While loyalists and members of Sinn Fein checked out McFadden’s cover story it seems that his latest career invention was accepted by the dissident grouping and its members.During recordings of the bugged meetings, McFadden was said to be “cool as a cucumber” throughout.Since the arrests of the group’s alleged leadership, the New IRA has been in a state of disarray — the Derry unit of the organisation has all but cut ties with the rest of the group.The man believed to be the leader of the organisation in Derry, Thomas Ashe Mellon, has retained a friendship with only one Belfast member, an Ardoyne man whose father was murdered by loyalists.They are furious at Kevin Barry Murphy, the highest profile of those arrested, as he appeared to be close to McFadden but was duped by him, going on all expenses paid holidays with him.Murphy, from Coalisland, was once described in court as leader of the Real IRA in east Tyrone.The fall-out is most clearly visible by what has been happening in Maghaberry prison.In December three of the eight men arrested in the MI sting disavowed violence during separate bail hearings — all were from Derry.Only one, Paddy McDaid, successfully secured bail, after a relative, former Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney, agreed to stand a surety. McDaid told a High Court Judge: “I don’t advocate violence. I don’t say that violence is a way forward.”Joe Barr, also from Derry, told the High Court that “armed struggle is counterproductive”. Despite this he was refused bail, but ordered off the republican wing at Maghaberry.Counsel for Gary Hayden told a court he was prepared to make a declaration to disavow violence to secure release from custody, however his bail application was refused.Barr and McDaid were removed from the list of prisoners supported by the Irish Republican Welfare Association— the group that looks after prisoners’ families.Only Hayden remains on the list, having backtracked on his High Court statement after being warned by Murphyfound guilty he would have to serve his full sentence with the criminal prison population.Only one other of the  arrested, Palestinian doctor Issam Bassalat, has been granted bail after suffering a number of heart attacks behind bars. He claims he was entrapped to attending the meeting by McFadden.Earlier this month a statement by the leadership of the New IRA appeared on a number of social media accounts, claiming they were “unbeaten”.The statement said: “The leadership of the IRA wish to make it clear, while others may disavow and abandon the struggle and their comrades, we are far from beaten”.A senior republican source said the statement was treated with derision, stating: “Those who put other men and women behind bars with their cosy relationship with a British agent are the last people anyone wants to hear from right now.“They’re not only beaten, but they’re finished and more than that regardless of what happens in the future they are no longer welcome.TIMELINEFEBRUARY : The alleged leadership of the New IRA hold a meeting at a rented property in Co Tyrone — the meeting is bugged by MI. JULY : A second meeting takes place in a dferent Co Tyrone bungalow, again bugged by the intelligence services. JULY : Dennis McFadden, a trusted member of Saoradh, goes missing along with his we and child from their home in Glengormley. Neighbours report blacked out vans outside the property. AUGUST : Nine members of Saoradh and a Palestinian doctor are arrested in connection with attendance at meetings organised by McFadden. AUGUST : David Jordan, Sharon Jordan, Barry Murphy, Amanda McCabe, Damien McLaughlin, Joseph Patrick Barr, Gary Hayden, Shea Reynolds, Patrick McDaid and Issam Bassalat appear in court on alleged terrorism charges. SEPTEMBER : A court hears that alleged members of the New IRA discussed bombing Shannon airport — the plot was discussed in bugged meetings to gain the trust of Islamic terrorists who would provide them with weapons. DECEMBER : Three of those charged with New IRA activity linked to the MI sting disavow violence in separate bail hearings — only one of those, Paddy McDaid, is granted bail.Related topicsIRASinn FéinMore On IRA PremiumGail WalkerOpinionAbuse spewed out on social media comes from decades of being schooled in callousness PremiumViewpointOpinionParamilitary threat still in the shadows PremiumFormer MLA Anna Lo on online abuse that forced her out of politics: ‘Trolls posted sex images of Asian women, linking brothels with me’ PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy deep-seated hatred may always plague this islandState Papers: Mary Robinson advised to avoid  World Cup tie between NI and ROI at Windsor Park as sectarian violence surgedMost ReadComber family home is bright and beautulWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean ‘Hearty applause’ for Royal Mail after service delivers letter to Co Antrim man using just his descriptionElderly man dies after taking ill aboard a Belfast city busFuneral of man stabbed in Downpatrick to be a ‘celebration of all the good things he stood for’Top VideosPlayVideo: Meet the couple that inspired the song #Carrickfergus Girl#PlayVideo: Major security alert onboard easyJet flight at Belfast International Airport PlayKate and Will pull pints behind the bar in Empire Music HallLatest Northern IrelandHow a sailor from Belfast met his Carrickfergus GirlA upgrade: How many more lives do we have to lose, asks grieving uncle of road victimWell-respected Belfast journalist Joe Oliver passes awaySDLP angry at lack of progress implementing education reportStephen CraiganOpinionFree agent Kyle Lafferty could make dference for a side struggling for Premiership survivalLatestSinead O’Connor’s missing son found dead aged Rising Man City star Cole Palmer must be ready to seize chance – Rodolfo BorrellAvian malaria outbreak kills around % of Humboldt penguin colony at Dudley ZooAlbanian opposition supporters clash over party leadershipDenise Van Outen announces separation from long-term partner Eddie Boxshall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It hasn’t undermined the position of the Protestant middle class. There’s no evidence to suggest that,” he said.Instead, a person’s outcome in le is shaped by ious socio-economic factors, such as third-level education attainment, home ownership and whether or not someone attended grammar school, he argued.“What this society needs to do is have a conversation about social inclusion. We still have a situation where the majority of places that are deprived are predominately Catholic,” explained the academic. “You get within sections of nationalism and republicanism saying that they’re ascending, they’re on the march, and the Protestant community is dysal and failing apart.“You have sections of unionism and loyalism, like Kate Hoey who accept that that their community is failing apart and it is being undermined and discriminated against.”Mr Shirlow continued: “There is no evidence for either of those arguments. So what we’re getting is this sectarian-identity reading of the social changes. “Nobody in that conservation is asking us the question why people are being left behind — two thirds of the children on the Shankill and the Falls are not achieving five GCSEs.”He described the debate sparked by Kate Hoey’s piece as a “sterile Catholic Protestant conversation”, adding younger generations here find such labels “tiresome”.“I think the term ‘dominated’ has to be withdrawn. It’s basically taking the language of civil rights, that once there was a domination by unionists and now we have people claiming there’s a domination by the other side.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

An exhibition will be held in the Millennium Forum and will run during the Feis Between April  and April . There will be a special prizewinners concert April  which will feature former Feis competitors such as Bronagh Gallagher, Margaret Keys, Gerald McCrystal, Eoin OCallaghan and others are yet to be confirmed. Feis Committe member, Patrick MacCafferty, spoke of more plans for the celebrations, As part of the centenary, I have been involved in recording a number of songs and music which would have been performed at the Feis over the years, he said. It involves artists that have gone on to make their careers in music such as Doreen Curren, Mairead Carlin and Fergal Murrey.The hope is to produce a CD which will be on sale. Also, a number of special competitions have been included in the Irish language such as, Write a manesto on your hopes for the Irish language for the next years, in poetry,a short favourite poem, in storytelling, a story or folktale about Derry.There are also musical competitions in every genre.  Patrick continued: Feis means everything to me. I have spent my whole le competing. I have been on the committee for some time. Easter has always been Feis week in our family.You may have got away on Easter Sunday, but the rest of the week was Feis. My grandmother sang in a choir at the first Feis, and my grandfather was on the second committee. My father competed in the Feis in the late th century and he was the official accompanist from  until he passed away . Feis is part of me. It is more dficult to sum up what it means to Derry. There is no doubt that in the early days it was the only place to express your talents, it was the only  for many but now thereare many outlets. One thing is certain that when you look at the talent that started their careers on the Feis stage such as Dana, Roma Downey, Frank Gallagher, Paul Murphy, and many more, it has done more than its fair share for this great town in taking our name abroad. In November , Derry and Strabane District Council voted unanimously to support theFeis Doire Cholmcille Committee, as theymark this incredible milestone. Commenting on the motion, Aontuacute Councillor,Emmet Doyle,said: “The Feis Doire Cholmcille has been a cultural staple throughout the last  years in this city. Going back to Tuesday, June  to Friday, June , , the first Feis which was organised in conjunction with the Gaelic League. It is steeped in history, indeed on the third day of the first competition around  participants took part. In the late s there were around , participants. “The committee that runs Feis is made up of volunteers, they put so much time and effort into this event, they are real cultural ambassadors when it comes to Gaelic culture in this city and district. “Over the hundred years of Feis Doire Cholmcille some of the best talent of this city and across the island have come through the competitions of the Feis. It is just as important to those who value gaelic culture as those who value the Jazz Festival, as Halloween, as St Patrick’s Day and should be treated as such.” DUP Alderman, Hilary McClintock, agreed the Feis is ‘an institution within this city’. Ms McClintock said: “Many young people have not only taken their first step to fame and stardom, they have developed confidence and self esteem which has stood them in good stead throughout their lives.” Sinn Fein Councillor, Emma McGinley,added: “A few of us will have our own memories of taking part in the Feis growing up. We have no doubt the centenary should be celebrated.” As part of the centenary year, the Committee are also doing a few exhibitions with pictures and memories over the  years. They wrote: To complete the set of  Feis Books for the Centenary, we are only missing the year, . Feis goers, could you please check your attics and ask your friends.It would be fantastic to have the complete  Feis.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Visit Invest NI to learn more about the grant and whether you are eligible.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

McDermotts calming influence helped Banagher seal a Derry intermediate title, as well as paving the way for their run to the clubs first ever Ulster hurling victory and final appearance. Pic by MT Hurson.  A tight corner back, McNicholl had a solid season, helping his team to a county final, where they hung onto Slaughtneils coattails for a signicant period. The young defender showed energy and ability in a full back line that was sorely tested against the Derry and Ulster champions in the final, but McNicholl stood up and looked the part throughout. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McCloskey sat at the heart of the Banagher defence and performed the role he has for years with his customary no-fuss and high level of effectiveness. Unerring in his defensive responsibilities and appetite for a battle, Ruairiacute Roe has relished the inidual duels with opposition attackers, as well as marshalling the defenders around him consistently. Pic by MT Hurson.  Shted around in the Ulster series, McGuigan had been a confident figure at full back, and took advantage of his man-marking role further out the field to point against Dunloy. Any attacker coming into direct opposition to McGuigan found it dficult to have a major impact on the game as he helped Slaughtneil to a ninth successive Derry title and fourth Ulster crown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Aggressive and committed, Farren earned praise from fellow half back Mark Lynch after their county final win and was named man of the match. His intensity and industry formed a key part of a resolute Banagher defence, and he often popped up as the man who delivered the ball into the opposition half. A very solid season from the Banagher man. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Bradley has the sweepers role down to a tee and was excellent in the recent Ulster wins over Dunloy and Ballycran. His versatility is key to the Slaughtneil system, slotting seamlessly into the deep-lying role, while on occasion being pushed further up the field during games in which the Emmets look like they are in control. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Hitting - in the Ulster semi final, McGrath has added an extra dimension to his game this season and was a thorn in the side of the Dunloy system. His physicality and incessant running leaves opposition half forwards often looking over their shoulder for the burst forward, or the defence-splitting passes that feed Slaughtneils talented inside forward line. Pic by John McIlwaine.  One of two Slaughtneil men making both the football and hurling teams of the year, Rogers has been unstoppable. From rising from his sick bed to hit - against Dunloy to repeating his goal heroics in the Ulster final, his record speaks for itself. Usually stationed further forward, he is thoroughly enjoying his role in the centre of the pitch. Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile.  With a physicality and fitness that takes him up and down from the full forward line to midfield regularly, Foley drove Na Magha to within a whisker of the Ulster JHC final. His accuracy and consistency from frees gives his side the cushion of a few points heading into any game and his versatility was clear during the Ulster series of games. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix.  Top-scoring with - in the county semi final win over Ballinascreen, Bradley was the man Lavey looked to to try and turn things around in the final defeat to Banagher, and his late free set a few St Marys hearts fluttering. He has the energy and commitment to torture the most attentive half back, while his accuracy from frees ensures any discretions are punished. Pic by Mary K Burke.  ODoherty recovered from a shoulder injury to take his place against Dunloy and Ballycran, firing over frees and moving defenders around just ashed never been away in the first place. Whether supplying quality ball from deep positions, or slotting scores at the other end, journalists are advised to bring an extra pen where ODoherty is concerned. Pic by John McIlwaine.  Lynch performed superbly in the county final win over Lavey, and was influential as Banagher dug deep in their semi final win over Swatragh. A passionate performer, his non-stop movement troubles defences and he has the composure and experience to find big scores at crucial times to help St Marys over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McKeever had another good season in both club and county colours, and was arguably Derrys intercounty player of the year. He showed both the physical presence to win his own ball and a keen eye for goal. Hit a point in the county final against a strong Slaughtneil defence and can look forward to another good season for both Derry and Kevin Lynchs. Pic by Mary K Burke.  McGilligan racing off after scoring the goal that finally defeated Swatragh in the IHC semi final is an abiding image for the year. A real threat when he is moved inside, and equally when left around the middle of the field to allow his physicality and skill to win contested ball. If played at the edge of the square in their Ulster final, expect a titanic battle with Rory Porteous. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rogers goal against Dunloy caught the eye, but the strength and composure shown by Cassidy to catch the ball, hold off Ryan Elliott and pop it to Rogers while on his knees deserves recognition. Often described as the unsung hero of the Slaughtneil attack, Cassidys industry and clever movement are the key that unlocks even the most tight defence.

Pic: Claudy Rovers Facebook.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A long-standing County Derry football club has taken the dficult decision to fold, citing a lack of playing numbers as the main reason. googletag.cmd.push Claudy Rovers, who competed in the North West Junior Premier League at their pitch, known locally as the Congo, announced the decision via their social media channels earlier this week. It is with a heavy heart that I write these words but after a committee meeting tonight the tough decision was made that the club is folding with immediate affect, they said. It just seems to be very dficult at present to get enough men to commit to a game of football on a Saturday and it has been a struggle all season to do so. The club would like to thank the efforts of everyone who has played, managed, volunteered, attended meetings, sold tickets, bought tickets, organised events, washed jerseys, sponsored the team and supported the team over the years. The team has given us many fond memories of trophy wins, trips away in the Irish Junior Cup and many a great days craic in the Congo watching the men in sky blue and white stripes all this won’t be forgotten.  County Derry Sporting Review: February  IFA inclusivity award for County Derry football club.   The news prompted widespread sadness, with many former members and former opponents expressing their disappointment with the clubs folding. Sorry to hear this I always enjoyed the games with Claudy Rovers with Curragh Rd and Newtowne. Always a hard battle on the pitch and great banter with them after, said one comment underneath the original post. Sad news many a battle we had in the Congo with Newbuildings but always a handshake at the end, the McDaids put some years into club, said another. One comment made reference to grassroots footballs changing status in modern society. It’s a matter of time for many other Clubs too. People used to mostly work Monday to Friday. Now they work by all week, they said. Football is less and less a priority for most now. It used to be the single most important thing in most players lives . Now after work comes everything  then football sadly. However, another expressed hope that the decision could be reversed at some stage. There may be a Phoenix moment in the future, keep focused, they said, adding Theres no Claudy with no Rovers.

Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Brendan Rogers  “Ive barely trained all week,” said Rogers after his - haul in the Ulster semi final win over Dunloy. The Emmets man had risen from his sick bed to down the Cuacutechullains, producing a superb performance in his relatively new role in midfield. A week later, he repeated the trick, finding the net against Ballycran as Slaughtneil lted their fourth Ulster title. In this form, Rogers is unplayable. He hit scores from distance. He won dirty ball. He linked the play, and at crucial moments, he took off at a canter, beat the defenders and put the ball in the net. That ability has the effect of both unsettling opposition defences and getting maroon and white-clad supporters in the the stands on their feet. In the feedback, one respondent said Rogers was an absolute pleasure to watch and a reliable, classy player. Others said his selection was an easy choice and hailed him as a match winner, while a further response said no words needed. “He is the man that has driven Slaughtneil forward this year in both Derry and Ulster championships, and has been a class act,” suggested a further respondent. One response simply said the man is lethal. The Emmets will certainly hope so, and all of Rogers attributes will be required as they head into an All-Ireland semi final meeting with either Ballygunneror Kilmallock .

Young Hurler of the Year  McLaughlin celebrates his goal against Cootehill. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix. Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin  In what has been a breakthrough season for the Na Magha corner forward, Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin has shown plenty of promise. With his side labouring against Cavan champions Cootehill in the Ulster quarter final, it was the young star who rattled the net to calm their nerves. McLaughlin is a lively attacker, whose clever movement has the result of both creating room for himself and freeing up space for his fellow forwards. His ability to appear in the right place at the right time was recognised in the feedback, with one respondent saying he got scores when they were needed at crucial times. Another said he slotted into the team with a quiet confidence, while a further response said he was the most committed young hurler in the county. “Brilliant young player. Fantastic, consistent playing at every match. Shines at every game and is an outstanding team player, always puts the team first,” added another. A fine season in the Antrim league as well as on the Derry and Ulster scene have laid the foundations for the Na Magha man to push forward in .

Pic by Cathal McOscar. googletag.cmd.push Eunan McElhennon  In a year where Desertmartin perfected the attack from deep-lying positions, McElhennon was a key weapon. Whether it was bursting forward with the ball, or getting on the end of a sweeping move, the electric half back was on the score sheet regularly. He found the net with an outstanding inidual effort in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, and continued his scoring run throughout the Ulster championship campaign. One respondent on the feedback form pointed to McElhennons speed, strength and shooting, while another said you could play him anywhere on the pitch. A further response said he was the best half back in Derry and Ulster for his speed and skill on the ball, while another hailed him as an influential player. “He played some great, entertaining football and was very focused and smart on the field,” added another. One respondent simply nominated Runabout McElhennon, while another said he was easily the best player on the pitch in nearly every game this season. Ending the year with two junior medals to his name, along with his Desertmartin team mates, the half back can be well satisfied with his performances.  Young guns to get opportunity as Derry name McKenna Cup lineup  The Oakleafers start their campaign tomorrow night in Owenbeg.   Young Junior Footballer of the Year  Murray capped the season with his first start for Derry seniors last night. Pic by Cathal McOscar. Lachlan Murray  Murray wasnt even eligible for Desertmartins first junior success this season, but their full forward was busy anyway, helping secure Ulster and All-Ireland minor titles for Derry. Eager not to miss out, he added the  junior football title to his growing medal collection, and featured strongly in the run to the Ulster junior semi final. With St Martins clearly the team to beat at this level, they faced packed defences wherever they went, with Murray having to work hard to create the space he needed. And he did. Sean Dolans Rory McGurk used his experience to curb Murrays enthusiasm in the early stages of the county final, but he did what talented young players do. The teenager adapted his game and maintained his composure to slot six points from frees as Desertmartin eventually won by ten points. One respondent to the feedback said Murray was the main man in that Desertmartin team, while another said he had a bit of everything in his game. “An exceptional talent.

Derry had led from early in the game when Niall Loughlin gave them the lead after just three minutes, and points from debutant Lachlan Murray and Emmett Bradley saw the Oakleafers lead by - to - at half time. Monaghan sprung a number of changes, and had five made by the time Derry introduced Declan Cassidy in the th minute, with Miacutecheaacutel Bannigan contributing - off the bench. A nd minute free from Jack McCarron nudged the away side ahead, but Ethan Dohertys immediate response levelled matters again. With the game deep in injury time, Kieran Duffy found room and sent over what the Farney men must have thought was the winner. Doherty though, broke onto a Matthew Downey through ball and with the whites of Rory Beggans eyes in front of him, tucked it between the posts to ensure Derry started the season with a draw. *Full report, pictures and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Caoimhín Doherty Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Morgan Murray and Steelstown have their focus set on the club’s first ever Ulster intermediate final against Moortown at Glen on Sunday. googletag.cmd.push Steelstown are coming off the back of their first ever championship and they hope their support on the sideline will help them push on again and double their success. Murray admits his side will have to ‘dig deep’ against a strong team in what are likely to be tough conditions. “It’s evident after the county final that our fans played a big part in helping us over the line,” he said. “The support from them throughout the game was unbelievable and once that final whistle went, it was emotional celebrating with huge club figures who have been there so long. “It’s a special feeling having your family there on the day too, and when we got over the line, having them there made the victory that much sweeter.” Winning the county final was special, says Murray. Pic by Mary K Burke. The -year-old also added how he expects another big turnout despite the weather conditions. An All-Ireland semi final is the prize for the winners, but Morgan insists the ‘Oacutegs’ are not looking that far ahead. “We don’t like to get too far ahead of ourselves, we always just take it one game at a time,” he said. “Obviously,the situation comes that we’re in an All-Ireland semi final, we will be more than prepared, but at the minute, Moortown on Sunday is where our focus lies.” This is Morgan’s first year on the senior side after impressing last year with Steelstown’s reserve team. Murray admits it was a dficult campaign for himself last season with injuries and missing out on senior football. “I was training with the seniors but wasn’t getting to play with the seniors, so I was playing reserve football,” he said. “That was disappointing, and injuries didn’t help, but it just motivated me to push myself on to demand my place on the senior squad. “Reserve football gave me the opportunity to enjoy my football again. “And as I said, I was still in around the seniors, seeing how far they had gone having reached the final and seeing that togetherness, it gave me the drive to be part of it.”  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.   The left-footed forward’s drive and determination in last year’s campaign has landed him where he is today in the Steelstown senior squad. “Thankfully this year, my coaches have put a lot of faith in me and that’s pushing me to perform week in week out,” he said. “I’m very grateful to have had a big part in the team this year and winning the club’s first ever Championship is something that will stay with me forever.” The Pennyburn man has scored a championship total of - and earned his place in the County Derry Post’s Intermediate Team of the Year for  – alongside seven of his teammates. Going into the final, Moortown have an average of . points conceded per game while Steelstown sit at . points. The Derry men are typically big scorers in their games, but Morgan played down the signicance of the statistics. “I don’t think they’re relevant, to be honest,” he said. “It’s an Ulster championship final so anything can happen, but I’m confident that come the final whistle, we’ll have done enough to win the game.”  PREVIEW: Tyrone champions will be Ulster final favourites, says McGrath  Steelstown take on Moortown in Sundays intermediate decider.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDerry Christmas: Christmas time Out and About around Derry pubs overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job.

Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now.

I do not trust people who are all-things-to-all-men, least of all people who seek high elected office on that basis.There were early warning signs of problems with Mr Blair, not least the way that he projected himself as almost archetypal Tory English, but also in a way Scottish, and then — when he addressed the Dail and talked of Ireland being in his blood — as Irish too.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Not at age  or , but he actually still harboured such ambitions after he left Oxford University.I have a theory that Blair’s undoing is rooted in that specic vanity — the desire to be a rock celebrity. Because he achieved a iation on it in September  , days after the terrorist attacks in America.The then President George W Bush was addressing both houses of Congress in the US, in the fevered aftermath of the atrocities. Tony Blair, who had been the first foreign leader to speak to Mr Bush after the attacks, had flown out to America and was a special guest for the speech.The president turned at one point to the UK prime minister and said that the US needed allies like him.“Thank you, friend,” Mr Bush said.The cameras zoomed in on Mr Blair, who seemed to be suppressing his delight as the parliamentary leaders of America gave him a standing ovation.At that moment, one of the biggest television audiences in America, at a time of national crisis, was cheering the MP for Sedgefield.Think about that.No rock star has ever had a moment like it.Not even the Beatles, who tended to appeal to younger generations, have attracted the adoration of almost an entire superpower.And it was almost asMr Blair, having had the stardom that he had long sought, resolved internally never to put in jeopardy that mass affection.The rest, including his downfall, is history. As it happens I thought he was largely right about that thug Saddam Hussein, evenhe was disastrously wrong in the specics of weapons of mass destruction.I also did not like Blair’s approach to Northern Ireland. While he held firm on important unionist principles in the run-up the Belfast Agreement of , he then initiated an approach to NI politics of appeasement of republicans that has persisted to the present day.But of course he should get a knighthood!Indeed Mr Blair should have been offered it the day he left office.If we are going to be a society that has an honours systems, andthat honours system is going to have a culture known as ‘gong by rank’ , then plainly the head of government should be at the very top of the list.By the way I recall reading many years ago that ‘gong by rank’ would be phased out, and that awards would be based on achievement, not on position. But as far as I can see high court judges still get them automatically.A high court judicial position is one of immense importance and prestige, and such office holders should be worthy of the job and,so, deserving of great respect.But being prime minister is much more important still.It is for that reason that most people can remember and name every prime minister of their letime .Thus even the most short-tenured prime ministers such as Alec Douglas-Home in the s are remembered more than  years later in a way that few other public figures are known.Don’t be fooled by Boris Johnson. For most incumbents, being PM is no fun thing.Indeed perhaps a majority of inhabitants of Downing St in recent decades have emerged as damaged human beings, in some cases almost broken .How absurd that we honour pop stars with knighthoods and people who have achieved great but brief success in, say, athletics but not someone who has been premier of the United Kingdom.What a reflection on our loathing of those who do the vital job of politics.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: You can already see something of a stretch in the evenings——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy said noSinn Fein, its allies and its proxies have played a prominent role in promoting this way of thinking.They claim that unionists have been invited to join a ‘respectful’ conversation aimed at creating an ‘inclusive’ and ‘progressive’ -county republican state. This language is chosen to appeal to people who see themselves as more reasonable, rational and, let’s face it, superior to those of us who have a fixed preference for remaining in the UK.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.But do buzzwords like ‘shared’, ‘respectful’ and ‘inclusive’ really mean anything in the context of Northern Ireland’s proposed destruction  Most of the evidence suggests that they do not and we’ve seen two good examples this week.First, there was the saga of the Queen’s platinum jubilee tree. The DUP MLA, Joanne Bunting, asked for permission to plant this piece of greenery on the Stormont estate, as part of the ‘Green Canopy’ project. This is a royal initiative encouraging people to “plant a tree for the jubilee”, as an environmentally sound way of marking the th anniversary of the Queen taking the throne.Bunting’s proposal should have been uncontroversial but, unfortunately, the finance department has responsibility for the grounds around the Assembly and it is led by Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy. The request to plant a tree was denied. In an attempt to explain, the minister released a statement. “My department’s policy on commemorative structures or planting on the grounds of the Stormont estate is to approve only those requests which commemorate international events.”If nothing , this explanation was consistent, as it is not the first time Sinn Fein has vetoed horticulture it sees as too unionist friendly. Last year Murphy prevented the planting of a rose bush at Stormont to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary. The party may see everything through the greenest tinted spectacles, but it cannot be accused of being overly green-fingered.On Twitter, a former Fianna Fail candidate, Fintan Cox, described its latest decision as “shockingly petty... bordering on sectarian hatred ... a bloody tree!” There was widespread incredulity on social media that Murphy could block such a harmless gesture.Later in the week, though, Sinn Fein was involved in a similar incident and this time it complained about ... a book! The offending volume, ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ by Anthony Leask, was visible behind the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during a Stormont committee video meeting.Maoliosa McHugh, one of Sinn Fein’s burgeoning phalanx of unelected MLAs, interrupted the call to ask the Assembly clerk for an investigation into the permissibility of displaying the publication. ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ records stories from the men and women of the thBattalion of the UDR.Sinn Fein and others have long tried to demonise this regiment, which suffered horric casualties during the Troubles, portraying the crimes of a few rogue soldiers as systemic ‘collusion’ with loyalist paramilitaries.Allister responded, “Having blocked a centenary stone, a rose bush ... and a tree planted for Her Majesty’s jubilee, republicans now ... try to dictate the contents of my study!” McHugh justied his intervention by claiming, “Workplaces should be neutral spaces.” By this logic, anyone who occasionally works from home should conduct an equality audit of their bedrooms or kitchens, before taking their next Zoom call. The imperative to take offence can call for ingenuity at times. A contemptuous attitude to anything associated with unionism, by people who claim they wish to be respectful, is not confined to Sinn Fein. You hear similar things from nearly all the leading voices in the ious campaigns for a ‘shared’ or ‘new’ Ireland. Indeed, it is almost a prerequisite for anyone who pushes this view in the media, or even just on Twitter or podcasts. The implication is that unionists must shape the  county state while they can, because their place in the United Kingdom and their hopes for Northern Ireland’s future are about to be destroyed. These frequent outbursts actually epitomise neatly the latest wave of nationalist campaigning and it is genuinely useful to have such plain-speaking. It’s a necessary counterpoint to meaningless platitudes about sharing and respect. These campaigners are all smiles and kind words while the ‘conversation’ about Northern Ireland’s constitutional position remains entirely on their terms. When unionists articulate alternative ideas about the future or challenge nationalist assumptions, the smiles soon disappear to reveal ugly and laughably premature Irish nationalist triumphalism.So long as we hear plenty of that and Sinn Fein keep making petty decisions, fewer naive people, at least, will be taken in by empty rhetoric about a ‘new Ireland’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol. Boris Johnsons reluctance to impose further measures in England would make it dficult for any devolved government to win Treasury backing for a lockdown where.Mr Drakeford suggested the playing field was not level, in terms of funding any future restrictions.\"We have had this long-standing argument with the Treasury in London, that when English ministers decide that they need to move up the levels, they know they can draw on Treasury money to do so, and we and Scotland and Northern Ireland are not in that same position,\" he said. \"So we would not be able to move to [Alert] Level Four measures on our own, because level of support you’d need to offer to the Welsh economy in those circumstances is simply beyond what the Welsh Government ourselves are able to mobilise.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I have won titles before and I came here with that ambition.“We have good players to do something amazing this season.”Lage is expected to make some changes against the Blades. John Ruddy is likely to deputise for Jose Sa in goal, while the likes of Ki-Jana Hoever and Fabio Silva could also be handed rare starting places.Rayan Ait-Nouri is fit again after a groin problem and the French defender could get his first outing for a month.Hwang Hee-chan , Willy Boly , Jonny Castro Otto , Yerson Mosqueraand Pedro Netoremain out.Lage, a former assistant manager at Sheffield Wednesday, may not make too many changes, however, with his team having played only once since December .“It is an opportunity for us to continue in our way and be consistent. In the last three games we have played well and we need to continue with that mentality,” said the Portuguese.“The cup is big in the history of football and we will go with our strongest team.“Now you can watch any English game all around the world, but a long time ago there was only one to watch – the FA Cup final.

We continue in the same way.”.removeArsenal’s lack of alternatives in midfield particularly for the month of January could have been solved by keeping Maitland-Niles until the end of the month when Partey and Elneny would have ed from Africa Cup of Nations duty.But Arteta insisted: “We are very, very short but to be fair on a player this cannot be the only argument to try to keep a player.“A player who has been developed and raised through our academy, a player who has been very patient in many moments to try and fulfil his dream.“He was very straight with me and I understood the situation. We think it is a good option. Obviously we are going to move and look for options because we are very short there.”One solution for Sunday’s clash with Forest would be to drop attacker Emile Smith Rowe into the centre of midfield alongside Granit Xhaka.The Arsenal number  has played there this season and was used regularly in that position during his loan spell at Sky Bet Championship club Huddersfield in .What a year 💫 Thank you for all your support.🤍 pic aDUNTk— Emile Smith RoweDecember , Smith Rowe has scored nine times for the Gunners during the current campaign but only started one of their last seven games.Arteta explained: “Well the main reason was because he wasn’t completely fit to play. He’s been carrying an issue and that hasn’t allowed him to train regularly, to play regularly and that was the main reason.“Because in his performances and what he did before that international break, there is no question that he was one of our more important and consistent players.“Obviously now that the team has been doing well, there are other players who are doing well and have been performing well, that changed the situation, but I am very happy with him.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mikel Arteta says Arsenal are open to signing players during January window article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The Larne teenager was rushed to hospital where medics worked tirelessly to revive her, but to no avail.The inquest into her death took place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday this week by videolink, due to Covid.Gracie Leigh Gordon from Larne who died after falling into the River Inver in the town in November .Earlier that evening Gracie’s mother, Danielle Gordon, told the inquest she asked her daughter toby .pm, and that Gracie had been in a good mood. As she left, she said: “Bye Mammy, love you.”Mrs Gordon described her daughter as “a character” who was “always laughing and joking”. She said she was “absolutely beautul and she didn’t know it, she couldn’t see how beautul she was”. Gracie - a pupil at St Killian’s College - was very kind and thoughtful and “was always very concerned with everyone  being happy,” she added.A male school friend of Gracie’s told the inquest “she just loved being around everyone and I think everyone just loved being around her”. Every time he saw her in school she was “happy and bubbly”, he added. Gracie Leigh Gordon from LarneOn the evening of her death she met up with a female and two male friends and they walked along the river and sat on a wall and talked.The boys left first and the girls left shortly after, but Gracie had taken some alcohol and was moving more slowly. As they were going downhill her friend offered to walk in front and take her hand but Gracie replied “no, I’ll be fine” and walked on, about a metre in front.At that point, her friend said Gracie “slipped, grabbed a branch, fell flat on her back, let go of the branch and slipped down a hole in trees and bushes, sliding into the river and disappearing,” her movement having been “like she was going down a slide”. She contacted the boys and they phoned the police and her mother at .pm. The Fire Service arrived at .pm and found her  minutes later.Specialist firefighters used a line to access the fast flowing and flooded river down a steep embankment, bringing her back to land at .pm, where they started CPR.Emergency Medicine Consultant Dr Eimhear Kearney said Gracie arrived in Antrim Area Hospitalat .pm but had suffered a heart attack before arrival and had no heartbeat. Resuscitation efforts continued until .pm.Constable Joanne Campbell, who later investigated the scene, said the area where Gracie fell into the river had no lighting and was pitch dark. “The area was very slippery and the river bank near to where the deceased was located was particularly steep”, she added.A forensic test showed that Gracie had some alcohol in her blood and was probably mildly-to-moderately intoxicated. The Coroner concluded that Gracie stumbled whilst intoxicated, lost her footing and slid on mud on her back, sliding into the river. He said the postmortem found that she died due to drowning.:Gracie Leigh continues to inspire ‘acts of kindness’Mourners gather to say goodbye to Gracie Leigh"},{"url":null,"title":"new course for budding writers at carrickfergus museum ","story":"NI weather: motorists urged to take care due to ice and snow   Covid-: PCR tests no longer needed for people in NI with positive lateral flow resultsNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleNew course for budding writers at Carrickfergus MuseumBudding authors are being offered the opportunity to take part in a new creative writing programme at Carrickfergus Museum.By News ReporterWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Carrickfergus Museum and Civic Centre.Participants will join one of Northern Ireland’s top authors, Jo Zebedee for the four part course, beginning on January .The museum’s exhibition ‘A most proper verdict’, which explores attitudes to th century crime and punishment, will be used as a backdrop and for inspiration for the project.Various writing techniques will be taught, from how to capture ideas to creating structure and dialogue.Participants will join one of Northern Ireland’s top authors, Jo Zebedee.The sessions will take place on Saturdays from .am to .pm with the full schedule as follows:Day one – January : introduction to the project including idea generation sharing of initial ideas and exploring where they might go, and formal input including storyboarding techniques and architect versus gardener writing.Day two – February : structuring work including three act structure reader trust building believable characters, and creating a sense of placeDay three - February : writing believable dialogue delivering a satisfying ending, and a critique session, including how to give and take critiques.Day four - March  will be a finale event to showcase participants’ work.For further details contact   or email [email#protected]"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641566695558.jpg--covid_19___fri_7th_january_figures.jpg?164156669500","title":"covid  fri th january figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows no further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.
