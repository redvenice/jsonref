Photograph:  Joe KlamarAFP via Getty ImagesAustria has become the first country in the EU to make vaccinations against Covid-19 mandatory for all adults, but questions remain over whether it can sway those sceptical of taking the jab and how much the Alpine state’s government is willing to press those who won’t comply.The upper house of the Austrian parliament, the Bundesrat, on Thursday evening voted 47-12 in favour of a general vaccination mandate, formally approvinga law that will see those over the age of 18 who decline to take a jab face penalties of up to €3,600, unless they are pregnant or severely ill.The legislation, which was signed by Austria’s president Alexander Van der Bellen on Friday and will come into effect over the coming days, has been followed with great interest across Europe, where other nations have considered taking a similar step. Already approved by the lower house of Austria’s parliament with a clear majority last month, Austria’s vaccine mandate is due to come into effect in three stages.Every household is to be informed of the new law via post by March 15th, after which police will start monitoring people’s immunisation status via spot checks and issuing fines of €600, rising to up to €3,600 in case of noncompliance.In the third phase, those who cannot show proof of vaccination by a certain deadline are to be automatically fined, but it is unclear whether the government still keen to enforce its mandate to such a degree.In an interview with public broadcaster ORF on Thursday morning, health minister Wolfgang Mückstein was unable to give a date for the crucial deadline.As Austria has inched closer to a decision on mandatory vaccinations, the conservative-Greens coalition government of chancellor Karl Nehammer has simultaneously loosened restrictions for the unvaccinated.A “lockdown for the unvaccinated” was lifted on Monday, and shops, restaurants and hotels across most of the country will soon be able to receive visitors who haven’t got a jab, as long as they can show a recent negative test result.Political developments around the mandate have been followed closely in Germany, where government calls for a similar law have become more cautious in recent weeks.“Since the government announced the compulsory measure in mid-January, it has done everything to undermine, soften and make its own project redundant,” wrote Munich-based German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung in a comment piece. “The message is clear: we didn’t really mean it.”Gerald Loacker, a health spokesperson for liberal NEOS opposition party, said waning political enthusiasm for mandatory vaccinations was impossible to ignore.“What we are dealing with here is a vaccine mandate that comes into effect just as the government is making it possible for those who aren’t vaccinated to enter a bar with a subsidised free test result and raise a glass to their resistance,” Loacker said.“That’s not a coherent policy, and people in Austria are taking note of that.”Karl Stöger, a professor of constitutional law at Vienna university, said that seeming incoherence was partly a deliberate choice. “The vaccination mandate has legal teeth, but it is also a law that is very aware of the limits of what a state can force people to do,” he said.Stöger, who has advised the government in its handling of the pandemic, said it was possible that Austria’s constitutional court could still stymie the vaccine mandate, especially if an “endemic” situation of the virus with low hospitalisation rates no longer makes vaccinations appear vital.Like many other European countries, Austria is experiencing record rates of Covid-19 infections, but the number of patients in intensive care beds with the virus is declining.With 68.8 per cent of its population having received at least two shots of a vaccine, however, the government argues that only mandatory vaccinations will bring immunisation rates to a sufficiently high level to weather another wave of the virus later this year.Last December’s emphatic endorsement of the vaccine mandate idea on behalf of the government, then still fronted by interim chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, has also made it politically difficult for the conservative Austrian People’s party to change its mind without losing face.“There’s a sense the whole of Europe is watching us: a government U-turn at this stage would amount to a huge loss of face,” said Clemens Schuhmann, a journalist for Oberösterreichische Nachrichten newspaper.Yet enforcing the mandate could come with the risk of further stoking isions in a society already polarised over the course of the pandemic.Upper Austria, the northern state that Schuhmann reports on, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with fewer than 60 per cent of residents fully vaccinated in some municipalities bordering on southern Germany.“Those who will get vaccinated because of the mandate are the ones who can’t afford to pay the fines”, he said. “The risk is that others will get further radicalised and rather go to prison than take the jab.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and

of decapitated Roman bodies, possible evidence of a mysterious religious cult widespread across Britain.The researchers, working to uncover buried secrets along the line of the new high-speed railway, found two large Roman burial grounds in Fleet Marston, outside Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Among the 425 or so bodies, there were 40 that had been decapitated post mortem and buried with their heads at their pelvis or their feet.While traditional theories suggest that such treatment was doled out only to criminals and outcasts, that was not the case at Fleet Marston, said Carl Champness, the project manager at Oxford Archaeology, one of a group of specialist companies working for HS2.“We don’t think it’s to do with criminals or outcasts because they are buried amongst the others, not always towards the edges or outskirts of the cemetery, and the same sort of care is given to their burial as everyone else,” Mr Champness told The .There was also an equal balance between male and female remains being treated in that manner, while in one case a young woman who appeared to have died in childbirth was decapitated and buried with her child.That particular interment may offer a hint as to what was taking place, according to Mr Champness.“Maybe the sudden death of a young person or an inidual for whatever reason, the unexpected nature of the death… that may be the reason we are seeing these decapitated iniduals,” he said.The appearance of such bodies in Roman burial sites in Britain is not unusual, Mr Champness explained, saying that a percentage of remains were often in such a state, suggesting that the cult was widespread at the time.Exactly what the beliefs behind the burial right were, however, remain a mystery.The cemeteries found at Fleet Marston are of ordinary people, rather than high-status iniduals, which adds to the intrigue, said Mr Champness.Unlike a villa mausoleum, these grounds contained “the everyday people who would have farmed the fields, manned the shops, the market stalls these are the people who actually were living in this area”.The archaeological dig is on the outskirts of a Roman trading town, which was about a days’ march from Verulamium near St Albans, and Alchester near Bicester.The wide clearings at the side of the road suggest that market stalls and gambling dens would have been set up there to cater for travellers and soldiers passing through.Signs of this commercial purpose include gaming dice, lead weights and more than 1,000 coins found during the excavations.More from News Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredThe Crown star Claire Foy ‘was sent emails threatening rape by stalker who turned up at her home’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"foolish politicians have made life easy enemies west","story":"Across Europe, including Britain, preening politicians took security for granted. Even as they cut defence spending, they stuck two fingers up to the United States, the ally upon whom European security depends. The European Union, which contributed to peace by integrating the economies of Western Europe, came to believe it had secured peace beyond France and Germany. It expanded its borders toward Russia, even opening talks with Ukraine, but lacks the hard power to defend its members and friends. Observing Russian aggression, Finland, an EU member state, now urgently seeks fast-tracked NATO membership and American protection.Everywhere we look the foolishness and naivety of the Complacent Generation is beginning to reveal itself. The examples are many, but the energy crisis especially is a case study in stupidity.The crisis may be international, but responsibility for Britain’s lack of preparedness lies at home. Energy prices have been rising here for years, thanks to ministers loading green surcharges onto household and industrial energy costs. Now, with rising Chinese demand for gas, Russia exploiting Europe’s dependence on its gas supplies, the post-pandemic resumption of the global economy, and Britain’s depleted gas storage capacity and refusal to exploit its own reserves, wholesale gas costs have more than quadrupled since before the pandemic. British households, and our energy-intensive industries, will pay the price, just as they will pay for rising inflation and, however necessary they might eventually be, tax rises. The whole structure of our economy – too reliant on financial services, too geographically unequal, too exposed to stretched supply chains, poorly connected, with low productivity and too little investment – is as it is because of the decisions and indecision of the Complacent Generation. No politician of any party has yet provided the coherent plan for growth we need.Neither is there a credible plan to project and defend Western interests as economic, diplomatic and military power shift eastward. Geopolitical change has been hastened by Western errors, like Middle Eastern wars, naivety, such as through world trade policies, and the virus, which disrupted democratic societies more than autocratic states. But Britain and our allies have also been blind – perhaps wilfully so – to the actions of our competitors and enemies.China has bought its way into our critical national infrastructure, our universities and even, as we learned recently, our democratic institutions. It has corrupted international institutions, from the World Health Organisation to Interpol. It has created rival organisations – such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank – with the connivance of the British government. It has stolen industrial secrets and increased its economic and military reach around Asia and Africa.More from NewsChris Bryant accuses Boris Johnson of \u0026#39inciting\u0026#39 violence against Keir Starmer Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rolls royce unveils smaller figurine aerodynamic pose bonnets","story":"The Spirit of Ecstasy, the figurine that has sat on Rolls-Royce bonnets for the past 111 years, has shrunk.The car maker has unveiled a “reimagined” Spirit of Ecstasy for the electrical age. At 82.73mm tall, the new figure will be rolled out on Rolls-Royce’s first all electric car - the Spectre - when it goes on sale at the end of 2023. The streamlined Spirit has been slimmed down and remodelled to reduce drag, making the new car just that bit more aerodynamic.According to Rolls-Royce, the new figure is 17.28mm shorter than her predecessor (which measured 100.01mm).”Her robes, which flow behind her in the slipstream,” said the motoring company, “have been subtly reshaped to make them more aerodynamic and realistic.”But, said Rolls-Royce, “the most visible change is her stance”. The Spirit of Ecstasy had “previously stood with her feet together, legs straight and tilting at the waist.“Now, she is a true goddess of speed, braced for the wind, one leg forward, body tucked low, her eyes focused eagerly ahead”.After 830 hours of design modelling and wind tunnel testing, Rolls-Royce, based at Goodwood in West Sussex, but now a subsidiary of BMW, is delighted with the result. Not everybody else is quite so keen. The ’s motoring correspondent Jeremy Taylor concluded: “We think it’s, well, likely to be isive, looking as though it’s been attacked with a flamethrower.“Close inspection reveals that instead of leaning forward from the waist as previously, the woman is now crouched on bended knee. A subtle change that some might say amounts to diddly squat, literally.”Many  readers appeared to agree with him. “Unbelievable on so many levels. Aerodynamic drag on a 3 sculpture? Changing a well respected, traditional, lovely mascot? Ludicrous waste of time,” posted Phil Carmichael.Steve Webb wrote: “Unfortunately the picture I first saw made it look like a lady about to undergo a Gynaecology examination! Dear RR please leave well alone.”Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said the only mutterings of discontent had been emanating from the ’s correspondent. Out of hundreds of articles written about the design change, this was the only negative one.This is not the first time the Spirit of Ecstasy has enjoyed a revamp. In the car maker’s 111 -year history, the mascot has been altered subtly or otherwise around 12 times. This is the smallest version yet and while it reduces aerodynamic drag, it also helps when it has to shrink back into the bonnet on collision. The smaller, presumably the easier, the Spirit of Ecstasy is to retract.A Rolls-Royce spokesman said it had made the Spirit retractable in case of collisions. Legislation in certain countries - largely in the European Union - has ruled the figurine a danger to pedestrians. Not that that had ever been an issue, the spokesman said.  It also prevents the figure being stolen by passing thieves.The original Spirit of Ecstasy was designed by Charles Sykes – an artist and sculptor. Originally called The Whisper, the first Spirit of Ecstasy was based on a bronze sculpture Sykes had previously created for Lord Montagu of Beaulieu’s car and which in turn was based on Eleanor Thornton, the aristocrat’s lover.   More from News Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredThe Crown star Claire Foy ‘was sent emails threatening rape by stalker who turned up at her home’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inflation rishi sunak cant just hide behind bank england","story":"Inflation is headed above 7 per cent, according to the Bank of England. So what does the Government intend to do about it? Often, when this question is asked, the response is: “Surely controlling inflation is the Bank of England’s job? Nothing to do with the Government.” That’s wrong, and it’s important to understand why.The Bank of England has what economists call “operational independence” over monetary policy. That means the Bank sets interest rates rather than, as in former times, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But that doesn’t mean that inflation has nothing to do with the Government.First, it is the Government\u0027s job to tell the Bank of England what inflation rate it should be seeking to target each year. Presumably the answer for 2022 isn’t 2 per cent, unless the Chancellor is hoping the Bank will raise rates extremely aggressively in the next month or two. So if it isn’t 2 per cent, what is it?The response from some is to insist that the target ought to be 2 per cent even if that isn’t what’s wanted this year. That makes no sense. The Chancellor sets this annual target, so what does he want it to be this year? If he doesn’t care what it is this year, he can say that, but it is his job to set the target.Next, the Chancellor decides how far above the target it is acceptable for inflation to go in the short-term and what the consequences are for the Bank if the target is missed. So how far above is ok, assuming inflation would eventually fall back to target? Clearly, being  more than 5 percent above seems to be acceptable. Would being 10 per cent above be fine? Or 20 per cent? What discretion is the Chancellor allowing for the Bank? Is that just unlimited? If so, why is its being unlimited the right policy?The Bank has operational independence regarding the execution of monetary policy. But monetary policy isn\u0027t the only thing that affects inflation. Other policies do as well – for instance, the level of the Budget deficit. Will the Government seek to reinforce anti-inflationary monetary policy (by tightening the deficit) or to mitigate its effects (by loosening the deficit)?And it isn’t just the deficit. The Bank of England Governor has suggested that people should not seek wage rises in response to inflation. Such second-round effects can make inflation more persistent and the cost of cutting it higher. So does the Government intend to bolster the Governor\u0027s stance by limiting public sector pay rises this year?One of the concerns economists expressed about the switch to Bank of England independence was that it might risk people coming to think that controlling inflation was not the Government’s responsibility. Now matters may be even worse than that, for governments may succumb to the temptation to do more inflationary things in a futile short-term attempt to offset the political costs of inflation. We see some of that in response to soaring energy prices. The Government has announced a subsidy to energy bills to offset the impact of energy-price inflation on households. But governments cannot make inflation go away by just spending extra money. Everyone has known that for over 45 years, since the misguided attempts in the 1970s to “outgrow inflation” in the Barber Boom.If the government wants to get inflation down and to do so without unnecessarily high costs in terms of unemployment and output, it needs the right blend of policies. These may include properly enforced annual inflation targets to manage expectations of workers and firms, so they do not raise wages and prices too rapidly in response to future inflation movements changing deficit targets to reflect inflationary pressures, and public sector pay rises reflective of inflation targets (insofar as they are credible). That is the right way to go. Not subsidies to wish away specific price increases. Hold the Government to account for inflation and give it political credit when inflation is kept under control. Don’t let it pretend that controlling inflation is someone else’s job.More from NewsBoris Johnson sang ‘I Will Survive’, says new communications chief Guto Harri Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowChris Bryant accuses Boris Johnson of \u0026#39inciting\u0026#39 violence against Keir StarmerMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"paraplegic man walks thanks electronic implant spine","story":"A completely paralysed man was able to walk again at the touch of a button after an electronic implant was placed in his spine in a groundbreaking operation.Italian Michel Roccati had no movement or feeling in his legs following a motorcycle accident in 2017 which severed the nerves in his spinal cord.However, after Swiss researchers implanted an electronic array, which stimulates the nerves below the injury, he was instantly able to stand and walk, and has since been able to cycle and swim.“The first few steps were incredible – a dream come true. It was very emotional to see my legs moving,” said the 30-year-old.“I’ve been through some pretty intense training in the past few months, and I’ve set myself a series of goals. For instance, I can now go up and down stairs, and I hope to be able to walk one kilometre by this spring.”Similar technology has been used to help patients with partial paralysis, but it is the first time it has been shown to work in people who had no movement at all.The implant was developed by scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital, and works by stimulating the region of the spinal cord that activates specific muscle groups in the trunk and legs.The team needs at least six centimetres (2.4 inches) of healthy spinal cord below the injury so that the implant can stimulate certain nerves. It is fitted underneath the vertebrae, inside the spinal column. They then use artificial intelligence to discover the sequence of neurons which fire in iniduals when they want to carry out various activities, such as walking, cycling and even canoeing.At the moment, the implant uses just 16 electrodes to stimulate the nerves, but in time, the researchers want to move to 32 or 64 to gain even greater control.After the implant, patients need about 10 days of recovery, before the implant can be switched on. As well as Mr Roccati, it has been also trialled successfully on three other patients.Prof Gregoire Courtine, a neuroscientist from EPFL, said: “Our stimulation algorithms are based on imitating nature, and work exactly in the way that the spinal cord is stimulated by the brain. “When you first turn it on you can stand, and step but you still need support, and the gait pattern is poor, but it allows you to start training all this activity immediately, and over the course of several months we can decrease the support.“All three patients were able to stand, walk, pedal, swim and control their torso movements in just one day, after their implants were activated. That’s thanks to the specific stimulation programs we wrote for each type of activity.“We are not yet at the stage where it’s a commercially available technology that you can use with your smartphone, but that’s our next objective.”For Mr Roccati’s first attempt, two small remote controls were attached to a walker to help him support himself because years of inactivity meant his muscles were severely wasted. The remote controls were attached wirelessly to a tablet which forwards the correct signals to a pacemaker in his abdomen. That pacemaker then relays the signals to the implant which stimulates specific neurons in a specific sequence, allowing the muscles to fire up in the correct order.Mr Roccati underwent surgery for the implant last August and has been steadily improving ever since.He said: “I had an accident on a motorbike and I immediately understood there was something wrong. I tried to move my legs and saw it was impossible. But I fixed in my mind that it was a problem to be solved.“I was living with my parents, and now I have an apartment and I can do everything alone no problem.”Dr Jocelyne Bloch, a neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital, added: “There are so many patients around the world who need a treatment to fight against paralysis.“This technology is so precise that immediately after the surgery, the patient can walk and stand. The electrodes are arranged in a way that corresponds exactly to the spinal nerve roots.“That gives us precise control over the neurons regulating specific muscles. Ultimately, it allows for greater selectivity and accuracy in controlling the motor sequences for a given activity.”While the progress achievable in a single day is groundbreaking, the gains after several months are even more impressive.The three patients were able to regain muscle mass, move around more independently, and take part in social activities like having a drink standing at a bar.The team is now working with Onward Medical, a medical technology company, to move the technology to a smartphone, so patients can simply select the activity they need.Larger clinical trials will be taking place in the US and Europe imminently, with the team hoping the device will be available within the next two to three years.Details of the research were published in the journal Nature Medicine.More from News Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredThe Crown star Claire Foy ‘was sent emails threatening rape by stalker who turned up at her home’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins global goals","story":"The Russians have continued to build up their forces around Ukraine US officials fear they could take Kyiv within two days.

It is utterly misguided.Mr Putin’s claim that Russia and Ukraine are an inisible part of ancient Rus is fantasy. Ukraine is an independent nation, the security of which several nations, including the UK and Russia, vowed to respect in a 1994 treaty. Nato membership for Kyiv is not on the table (the Ukrainian enthusiasm for it has only increased in reaction to Moscow’s interference).Moreover, Mr Putin’s goals are global.

And his celebrity appearance at the Winter Olympics in Beijing underscored the global stakes of this stand-off.

But they never mention the thousands of gipsies killed by the Nazis, because no-one wants to talk about the positives,” he said, to audience laughter.Mr Javid, the Health Secretary, described the joke as “horrid” and told Times Radio: “I think we all have a right to react to that, and one of the best ways anyone can react to that is to show these platforms what they think about Jimmy Carr by not watching or listening to him, and that will send him a very strong message.”The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said of Carr’s joke: “Those comments are deeply disturbing, and its unacceptable to make light of genocide.”Asked whether Netflix should pull the show, the spokesman said: “That will be a matter for them. We are clear that mocking the atrocities of the Holocaust is unacceptable.” He added that the Government was “toughening measures for social media and streaming platforms who don’t tackle harmful content” and “making sure that streaming services are more accountable”.Netflix made no comment on the matter.Carr issued a “trigger warning” to the audience at the beginning of the show, telling viewers he would say “terrible things”.His joke was condemned by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Auschwitz Memorial. The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, launched a petition calling for Netflix to remove the “truly disturbing” segment.David Baddiel, the comedian, tweeted: “Jimmy is a close friend of mine and a brilliant stand-up in general. Makes no difference to how I feel or think about this specific joke.”He said: “You can obviously tell a Holocaust joke that is cruel and inhumane and mean-spirited and racist. Or you can tell one that targets the oppressors, or draws attention to the fundamental evil of it, or shines a light on the humanity of the victims. Clearly, Jimmy Carr’s was the former.”Those defending Carr included Victoria Coren Mitchell, host of BBC Two’s Only Connect and a  columnist, who said she would not have made the joke but described him as “a man full of goodness and kindness… a properly decent person”.According to The Mirror, Carr addressed the controversy during a performance at the Whitley Bay Playhouse on Saturday night. Discussing cancel culture, he said: “The joke that ends my career is already out there.”This is not the first time has stood firm against calls to remove or censure a comedian on its site. Dave Chappelle, a US comedian, sparked a backlash when he made remarks about the transgender community in his Netflix special The Closer.Ted Sarandos, the service’s chief content officer, said he did not believe the comments passed the threshold for hate speech.More from NewsMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39 Russia-Ukraine crisis: Putin praises Macron following meeting in MoscowParents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredThe Crown star Claire Foy ‘was sent emails threatening rape by stalker who turned up at her home’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"unique shorthand created charles dickens finally deciphered","story":"Charles Dickens’s unique shorthand was so impenetrable that the author himself dubbed it “the devil’s handwriting”.Now, 210 years after his birth, researchers have deciphered its mysteries - and in doing so, uncovered an angry dispute with a newspaper over a blocked advertisement.The celebrated Victorian learnt Gurney’s shorthand at an early age, but modified it to create his own unique system that scholars had found all but unbreakable.Gurney’s shorthand was devised in the mid-18th century by Thomas Gurney, who published it under the title “Brachygraphy, or Swift Writing, Made easy to Meanest Capacity”. Dickens learnt it in his spare time and later used the skill to become a freelance reporter.Now, a team of researchers, backed by amateur enthusiasts, claim to have deciphered more than half of his private code, unlocking at least one letter and potentially nine other documents.The May 1859 missive, one of 10 known documents in Dickens\u0027s own hand that, until now, have been impossible to read, is addressed to the then-editor of The Times, JT Delane.The creator of Oliver Twist wanted to promote a new literary journal in an advertisement placed in the newspaper.At the time, Dickens already co-owned a journal, Household Words, with his publishers, Bradbury \u0026amp Evans.However, after falling out with them over a perceived lack of support during his separation from his wife Catherine, Dickens went to court to seek the journal\u0027s dissolution.He subsequently founded a new journal, All the Year Round, and aiming to draw in former Household Words readers, sought to place an advertisement in The Times that claimed the latter journal had been discontinued by him.Fearing legal repercussions, a clerk at the paper rejected Dickens’s submission, much to the author’s fury.In his letter to Mr Delane, a shorthand copy of which he kept, possibly for legal reasons, the 19th Century novelist claimed he had used precisely the form of words that the Master of the Rolls had ordered him to use in the court ruling.Dr Claire Wood, a lecturer in Victorian literature at the University of Leicester and part of the Dickens Code team that cracked the hieroglyphic handwriting, told The  that they had now deciphered around 60 per cent of Dickens’s shorthand.The project has brought together academic authorities on Dickens, experts in applied linguistics and amateur code-breakers from around the world.A £300 reward was offered for the most complete attempt to decode the letter. The overall winner was Shane Braggs, from California, who said he discovered the puzzle while browsing code groups on the social media site Reddit.So far, only 60-70 per cent of the letter has been translated, but it is enough to uncover its meaning.Describing the process of cracking the code, Hugo Bowles, a professor at the University of Foggia and author of Dickens and the Stenographic Mind, said: “We collected the lightbulb flashes from different solvers and everything just fitted together. You might call it ‘jigsaw reading’. One of our solvers found the words ‘Ascension Day’ and another found ‘next week’, which helped us pinpoint the date of the letter. Solvers who knew their Dickens identified the abbreviation ‘HW’ as his journal Household Words and connected the symbol for ‘round’ to his journal All the Year Round.With at least 40 per cent of the shorthand still to be cracked, the project will continue until 2023, with monthly challenges to get the public involved.“The great thing about working on it as a kind of crowdsourced initiative is that with every symbol that is decoded, we\u0027re building a glossary,” Dr Wood said. “So with every kind of step forward that we make, it becomes more and more likely that we\u0027ll be able to to make real progress in the undeciphered manuscripts.”More from News Russia-Ukraine crisis: Vladimir Putin praises Emmanuel Macron as leaders meet in MoscowMadagascar hit by second storm as Cyclone Batsirai displaces thousands and destroys critical cropsBritain sends 350 troops to Poland as Wallace warns Putin against \u0026#39foolish mistake\u0026#39Parents hit out at extra mock exams for overworked pupilsOttawa to arrest anyone bringing fuel to Covid \u0026#39Freedom Convoy\u0026#39 truckers after state of emergency declaredThe Crown star Claire Foy ‘was sent emails threatening rape by stalker who turned up at her home’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"12000 dwp work coaches biggest","story":"Exclusive: , DWP work coaches in biggest ever Jobs Army told to reapply for their own jobsThousands of Universal Credit advisors who were hired to form Britain’s biggest ever Jobs Army are now having to reapply for their jobs - with one telling the Mirror they are “let down” and “blindsided”Work coaches are employed in hundreds of Jobcentres across the countryByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsA staggering , Universal Credit advisors who were hired to create Britain’s “biggest ever Jobs Army” have been told to reapply for their own jobs. Department for Work and Pensionschiefs wrote to thousands of Work Coaches last week offering them an “opportunity to apply for a permanent role”.The number of Work Coaches doubled from , to , during the Covid pandemic as Universal Credit claims surged.

Specically, not being subject to it. Wedding vows, lockdown rules, basic morality, the Ministerial Code, his own manesto: the default response of the Prime Minister to all of them is PAH! Which is why itaposs interesting that, a week after the worst week in his premiership since the previous worst week, which was only the week before, the PM is now submitting himself to the control of his Chancellor of the Exchequer.In a single weekend, Rishi Sunakaposs mates have moved into No, expensive policy announcements have been binned, and the crime of fraud which has taken £bn off the taxpayer on Covid alone has been downgraded to a harmless infraction of little consequence.  Unfortunately, this whirlwind romance is headed for some very big and pointy rocks.The first is that the cost of living crisis, which is already a crisis, is going to get worse with food costs predicted by millionaires to rise another % in April. No-one knows what to call something worse than a crisis, but the dictionary will probably need updating to include something like crisaster.The second is the energy crisis, in which the taxpayer has been forced to compensate corporate giants for not being able to steal money immediately, and instead letting them steal it over  years. Prices are likely to rise again in the autumn, and because  months was too long for billion-pound firms to wait, the government may allow an extra price rise in the summer to tide them over. Presumably, weaposll be calling this frobbery.If Boris thinks Her Upstairs is dficult to live with, heaposs going to flip when he finds out that Rishi is the sort of spouse whoaposll give him £ towards the housekeeping, and then ask for £ back by exerting some below-inflation fiscal drag on state pensions. On the face of it, their relationship is rooted in shared politics and a mutual love of money. But while one partner is a hedge funder whoaposs got more money than the Queen, the other never carries cash because he canapost hold onto it for more than  minutes.Both of them seem unable to spot a party when it involves  people, soft drinks, beer, renditions of Happy Birthday, a society wallpaperer, an official photographer, a strategically-sly cake, and a police investigation. Both, according to reports, are also capable of enjoying all that in the space of just  minutes before getting on with the job, which is a polite way of saying you burped all afternoon.But thereaposs little  these two have in common. One is a spender, the other a spaffer. One drinks beer, the other power. One is vain enough to arrange photocalls on staircases so he doesnapost look as short, while the other has just one suit and no comb.

And therein lies the problem with this partnership: only last week, Johnsonaposs friends were telling him to kick Sunak out, on the grounds he was trying to steal his job.Imagine a bride trying to get the groom sacked, withholding cash while giving it to rich mates, giving Princess Diana eyes in TV interviews whenever sheaposs asked about parties. Picture a groom so desperate to keep the house that heaposll overlook their dferences, let her take total control, and start measuring up for curtains he will never get to see.Think about a relationship in that much trouble before its second anniversary. It might work in an Australian daytime soap, but it ainapost going to last in a world where people donapost come back from the dead after  years lost at sea. Johnson thinks heaposs saved his skin by ceding control to his most ambitious enemy, and boasts it would now take a Panzer ision to get him out of No. Sunak, meanwhile, is quietly lining up his tanks in the Downing Street garden, which he has always had a great view of from his No office. The PM is being infantilised by enemies saying his we wields all the power, and potentially criminalised by his friends claiming that she has nothing to do with his work, but nevertheless attended a lot of work events.And the only PR expert who can be persuaded to enter the fray is someone who considers the PM sexually incontinent, throws Benny Hill salutes at world leaders, quotes Gloria Gaynor, and on his first day gives the press the headline: Heaposs not a COMPLETE clown. But the fundamental flaw with this great reset, which is probably more of a breather to allow Rishi to liquidate assets, is that it involves trying to instil discipline in a man who has spent a letime shucking it. The fact he needs to be taught the self-control of a toddler is why he lives in Errorsborough - a town twinned with Débâcle.Fans may think these two have found the perfect blend of bluster and billionaire, but itaposll last only as long as it takes for Johnson to take back being out-of-control, and Sunak deciding that his tanks are ready to evict.

Those in education have had one of the most disrupted rides through the pandemic, with traditions and institutions normally a consistent and unchanging part of being young all going out of the window with the arrival of coronavirus. Now though, following the governmentaposs plans to ease the nation out of the grip of Covid amid the recession of the Omicron wave, efforts are being made tothe school experience back to something more like the pre-pandemic UK.Naturally, though, the move to the aposnew normalapos will require efforts and guidance to help the transition, for the generation forced to live through the changes, as smooth and fair experiences as possible. Will GCSE and A-Level exams be held in    The first, and perhaps most signicant, change to exam structure this year will be that GCSE and A-Level exams themselves will once again be going ahead. In  and , would-be exam sitters were instead given their results based on assessments made by their teachers, rather than the more traditional format of people flocking into exam halls to attempt papers under controlled conditions. The pandemic-specic format of handing out grades, rather than sitting exams, was introduced to prevent school children from spreading Covid amongst themselves by attending the exam in person. It was also due to the immense disruption caused by the pandemic, which led to children missing schoolthey tested positive, classes being online-only and teacher absences due to positive Covid tests. Grade boundaries will be lower with more generous grading  Ofsted, Englandaposs exams regulator, has said that grade boundaries are likely to be lower this year than they have been in the past. This means that papers are likely to be given more generous grades than they have been in previous years. The more lenient grade boundaries, which are due to come into play for children in Wales, Scotland and England, will aim to help soften the transition for children once again securing qualications through the normal exam method.The BBC report that there will be a aposmid-pointapos between the grade boundaries, seen in pre- years and throughout the pandemic and teacher assessment era.Dr Jo Saxton, the Ofsted chief regulator, said the aim was to give children a safety net when tackling a transitional period for the exams system. GCSE and A-Level students will be getting advanced information  Teenagers set to take exams this year will now be able to get information on what will be inside the paper ahead of time. News of the change appeared on the websites of exam boards on Febuary , , and it is set to cover over  formats across a range of exam levels from A-Level, AS and GCSE. The advanced information will aim to help children focus their revision, although it is reportedly unlikely to reduce the amount of content exam-takers will need to get their heads around.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we firmly intend for them to take place this summer, giving students a fair chance to show what they know.“We know students have faced challenges during the pandemic, which is why we’ve put fairness for them at the forefront of our plans. “The information to help with their revision published today, as well as the range of other adaptations, will make sure they can do themselves justice in their exams this summer.” In a statement regarding the extra information, the Department for Education said it: “Aims to focus students’ revision without providing exact questions that will appear”. It added: “Advanced sight of the content is one part of the adaptations in place to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education, recognising this cohort of students were affected by school closures during periods of lockdown and disruption due to absences. “Other adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs like English literature and history, and support materials like formulae sheets in maths.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationExamsNadhim ZahawiGCSEsA-levelsState exams\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Examiners will also be asked to be more generous than in previous years to account for the disruptions to education triggered by the pandemic. Pupils have suffered a third academic year of Covid-fuelled chaos to their schooling.But ministers pledged boosted support for youngsters so they are not unfairly penalised by the Covid- crisis.Some content, texts, topics and sub-topics, themes and skills due to be assessed have been made available for the majority of GCSE, AS and A-level subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Exam boards today published the details of topics that will appear in exams as part of changes to ease the pandemicaposs impact on grades.  The advance information is aimed at cutting the amount of content pupils need to be taught or tested on. In all subjects apart from English literature, history, ancient history, geography and art and design, pupils will be given notice about the topics to be covered in this summeraposs exams. The Department for Education said the extra information “aims to focus students’ revision without providing exact questions that will appear”. It added: “Advanced sight of the content is one part of the adaptations in place to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education, recognising this cohort of students were affected by school closures during periods of lockdown and disruption due to absences. “Other adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs like English literature and history, and support materials like formulae sheets in maths.” Jo Saxton, chief regulator of exams watchdog Ofqual, said: “Students have shown so much resilience during the pandemic and we know that they are seeking certainty. “Advance information published today is one of the ways we are supporting students to have that certainty as they prepare to show what they know and can do. “We are also ensuring there is a safety-net for students with a generous approach to grading.” Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: It is extremely important that this really does help to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on learning, and we will be studying it in detail to ensure that it provides fairness to students of all ability levels. National Education Union joint general secretary Mary Bousted feared the release of advance information “comes too late” for kids. “There are grave concerns amongst teachers of exam groups that this will not be enough to fairly mitigate the disruption these students have experienced over two academic years,” she added. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan claimed children and teachers “have had weeks of needless stress and uncertainty awaiting the information being published today, which for many pupils will feel like scant compensation for months of missed learning and development”.  An Ofqual spokesman confirmed there will “be generous grading” this year. He added: This will be delivered after marking is complete and when senior examiners set grade boundaries. “It is likely to mean grade boundaries will be a little lower than they might have been in a normal year, but grade boundaries are never set in advance, and so we cannot be precise at this point in the year.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said exams ”are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we firmly intend for them to take place this summer, giving students a fair chance to show what they know”.He added: “We know students have faced challenges during the pandemic, which is why we’ve put fairness for them at the forefront of our plans. “The information to help with their revision published today, as well as the range of other adaptations, will make sure they can do themselves justice in their exams this summer.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsGCSEsA-levels\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Billy Baxter, , from Blackburn, was kned in the heart and lungs on the evening of September  last year while walking near his home in what is believed to be a row over a girl. He had to undergo le-saving surgery after the attack and has since been left with a -inch scar running down theof his chest. His mum Jessie Brian, , found out about the attack when Billy messaged her on Snapchat to say he was on his way to hospital. She said the teen had been left traumatised by the incident and the family now plans to move out of the area. His  year-old attacker - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was sentenced to just  months in custody for the offence last week.  He was originally charged with attempted murder but this was downgraded to wounding with intent by the Crown Prosecution Service. Jessie hit out at the sentence, calling it a slap on the wrist while Billy had been forced to turn his back on his le and ambitions. Billy wanted to be a plumber and now heaposs too scared to go out of the house just when he got his confidence back, she said. Itaposs heart-breaking what heaposs done to my son, and in court, he held his head up high like nothing had happened. Iaposve been around this area for  years - itaposs the only area that Iaposve known - and now we have to leave because the attacker knows my address and so does his family. Billy has ADHD and autism and had spent more than two years without leaving his girlfriendaposs house due to his lelong developmental disability. But they broke up shortly before the attack on September  last year and Billy moved back home with Jessie. He was ambushed after leaving the house at around .pm to meet up with a new love interest. Jessie said: Heaposd been in a relationship, and heaposd found out she was cheating on him, so he came back home after isolating with her for two and a half years.  I said to Billy, Just get out there! You need to start socialising with people and making new friends. Forget about everything thataposs happened. So heaposd met this young girl, and managed to get to town and to see her, but then he heard his name being shouted across the road. He put his hood down and didnapost want any trouble, but next thing he knew the lad was in front of his face, and he got stabbed straight in the chest. Jessie said she found out about the stabbing after Billy contacted her over messaging  Snapchat in the minutes after it took place. She said: I got a phone call from one of his friends on Snapchat, and it was actually Billy on the phone saying that he had been stabbed. I thought it was someone having a joke because it didnapost sound like Billy. It was only when he said: It is me, mum, Iaposve been stabbed and Iaposm on my way to the hospital, thataposs when I found out. Billy was rushed to hospital where he required a le-saving operation after doctors found out he had internal bleeding. Jessie said: He was stabbed in the chest, between his heart and his liver. It pierced his heart, as well as cutting through a tube that runs from his heart for the blood supply, and slashing his liver. They had to open him up and pull his rib cage back and do an operation on his heart, and they had to repair the tube as well. It was an operation that he had to have within  hours - a le-saving operation - because he had internal bleeding as well, which is very, very dangerous. She added: It was a nightmare to tell you the truth, it really was a nightmare. Billy was left with a huge scar running down his chest, along with a couple of smaller ones dotted just above his stomach. But Jessie said that the poor lad was also left with mental trauma, which continues to this day. She said: My -year-old who wanted to go to college and be a plumber hasnapost got a le now because he wonapost go out. He feels very conscious about the scars. He talks about it every single day. Itaposs not just one little scar. Itaposs one big massive scar and two scars underneath it. Jessie also feels the sentence that her sonaposs attacker received wonapost deter other kids from carrying knives in the future. She said:  months is a slap on the hand. This boy who did all this will probably get out and get a job or whatever, and my son is left not knowing what to do next.

Dad Dr Shaun Russell was initially told that he had lost his entire family before officers at the scene realised Josie had survived the frenzied attack. Stone has always claimed his innocence and twice appealed against his convictions - with his lawyer previously highlighting a number of striking similarities between the Russell murders and the method Bellfield used to kill two of his three victims. DNA evidenceA bootlace could prove whether Michael Stone did beat Lin and her six-year-old daughter to death. Last year, Stoneaposs lawyer Mr Bacon said the shoelace that was missing until it was found in police storage in  - could provide vital DNA evidence. He said: It was a really vital piece of evidence. It was used in strangling one of the parties. So it was not only a piece of evidence, but it was a murder weapon.

Crucial eye-witness Josie also said she thought the murderer was taller than her dad - who is six foot.

Australian shepherd Miko is -months-old “makes every single person that crosses his path smile” and doesn’t like to be photographed in the same tie twice. When Miko sticks his head out of the car window, his tie flaps in the wind - and “it’s the most wholesome thing”. The Los Angeles pup loves wearing ties as much as strangers enjoy spotting him in them while heaposs out and about. “Seeing the joy in other people makes Miko happy,” owner Kelli said about her cheery pup.  During lockdown last year, Kelli Jones, based in Los Angeles, Calornia, met with a fellow dog owner who had a collection of pet bandanas for every occasion. “Afterwards, I was scrolling online and spotted a dog tie - I just had to try it,” she said. “I liked the idea of a tie because it wouldn’t be restrictive or uncomfortable for Miko.” And once the pooch started wearing ties outdoors, he never looked back as Kelli noticed the heartwarming effect it had. A stranger in the street spotted his accessory and “smiled so big, he couldn’t look away”. “We loved the positive reaction,” Kelli said. “I noticed that it made people smile when we were out, so we kept doing it to help boost morale during such a tough time.”  When Kelli is driving in the car, Miko will often poke his head out the window. Passersby will often do a “triple take” and point at his tie flapping in the wind. “It’s the most wholesome thing,” Kelli said. It isn’t just strangers that love the ties - Miko enjoys wearing them too. “The tie slips over his head and doesn’t touch the ground. It isn’t heavy so Miko doesn’t really notice when it’s on,” she said. Miko currently has  ties and used to wear them every time the pair left the house. Now, Kelli saves them just for special occasions - until she can find some new ones.  Miko has ties in all prints and patterns, from orange, red and navy to purple and yellow. He has a grey tie with smiley emojis on, one with multicoloured paint splatters and a zebra print one - which is Kelli’s favourite. “I like weird and funky styles,” she said. Kelli has a passion for fashion and likes to colour coordinate her outfits with Miko’s ties. On Miko’s first birthday last year, Kelli traded his usual tie for a bandana and party hat. He had a birthday cake with his name on it and went sheep herding on a ranch in Los Angeles to celebrate. “Miko had worn all the ties we had at home, and I didn’t want to recycle an outfit on his big day,” she said. “I don’t like to be photographed in the same thing twice, so why should he ”  Dog mum Kelli describes Miko as “the sweetest dog” and says he “makes every single person that crosses his path smile”. “He is super cuddly and strong, and I am so grateful for him,” she said. “Sometimes, I just look at him and cry.” Miko loves canine company and enjoys going to the beach and hiking with his doggy friends. He enjoys eating all foods, but his favourite has to be the “pup patty” from In-N-Out Burger. “It’s just a plain meat patty with no salt or bread so it’s safe for dogs,” Kelli said. When Kelli goes out to get coffee, she often gets Miko a “pup cup” because he loves Puppuccinos.

Mohammed Reza Zolati was visiting Longtimber Woods in Ivybridge, Devon, on June   with his two stepchildren when the tragedy happened.An inquest at Plymouth Coroneraposs Court today heard how the young girl managed to get herself out of the water before calling  for help, Devon Live reports.The girl escaped without serious injury but Reza ended up struggling in the water.His stepson stopped a woman for help and other good samaritans attempted to pull Reza out from the popular deep body of water off the River Erme.In a statement, the woman recalled how she and her friend were stopped by the boy while walking their dogs through the woods alongside the river.  The boy then told them his stepfather had been in an accident and led her down a rocky slope to the river. The inquest heard she saw the shape of a body floating under the water so jumped into the water to rescue him while her friend took over the  call from the stepdaughter. She told how she was not a strong swimmer but tried to e down into the water to reach him but was unable to, and said she kept getting swept away. The passerby said: “It was awful.” Even with the help of her friend they were still unable to. Another passerby joined in the effort and it was only when he was assisted by another man that there were able to pull his body onto the rocks and begin CPR. However, Reza was unable to be revived and was confirmed dead at .pm. The initial passerby said: “What happened was tragic but I believe everyone who helped was brilliant. “The little boy and girl deserve some credit as they were so calm and deserve praise too.” The inquest heard the passerby had managed to keep the children and also members of the public away from the scene. Reza, who was born in Iran and was a mechanic before moving to the UK, had been in the water for around  minutes before being rescued and was unable to be revived. A post mortem confirmed the cause of his death was drowning. His GP described Reza as being a ‘fit and well’ man. A police investigation confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances or third party involvement. Detective constable Rachel Walke said: “It appears from all our enquiries it was a tragic accident.” She added that on arrival at the scene, police were initially concerned for the welfare of the children who could not be seen but they were them confirmed as being safe and well at their nearby home. DC Walke confirmed that the pool was a popular area for swimming and that it was deceptively deep and was ‘very dficultapos to get out of once in the water. She added no rescue aids were available at the location. Coroner Ian Arrow, who recorded a conclusion of accidental death, asked the officer to find out who owned the land and that he would then review whether it was appropriate to write to them to review the lack of rescue aids. Following Rezaaposs death, a fundraiser was launched praising his heroic efforts and to raise funds to have his body flown back to his home country and for a memorial service in Devon. The fundraising page said: On Tuesday, June  , Rezaaposs stepdaughter got into some dficulty in the River Erme, located in Long Timber Woods, Ivybridge. Being the hero Reza was, he jumped in and saved her, but unfortunately was unable to save himself as he was a non-swimmer. This goes to show how selfless Reza was, and he showed this every day. He leaves behind his girlfriend and -month-old little girl, as well as lots of friends and colleagues who all saw him as family. We are trying to raise funds so Reza can be flown to his home country, to be laid to rest in peace with the presence of the rest of his family. We are also wanting to hold a memorial service for Reza here in Ivybridge so all who knew him can show their love and respect for him. The gofundme page states that the fundraiser was halted after being reported as aposfraudulentapos and was put under review.

But we are having to come to terms with the fact we might not have that special day for a very long time, as all our money is going towards surgery.Louiseaposs problems started after a minor car accident in December  triggered more than two years of constant and agonising headaches and relentless pain all over her body. She said: Over the next few weeks, I started to have headaches and neck pains, but I assumed it was whiplash. Sadly, that was the start of a living nightmare for Louise, who had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over the body, in February , after struggling to cope with stfness and pain. Before that growing up, she had always dislocated knees easily and suffered from random aches and pains, but had not thought much of it. She added: I dislocated my knee a few times, but I just assumed that was normal. I was told I was double-jointed. I had random pains that were unexplained when I was younger and Iaposve always had migraines, but I didnapost worry about them. Despite sometimes feeling like she was walking through cement because of muscle stfness, she put a brave face on things and even enjoyed a trip to Paris later that summer. But the car crash changed everything for Louise. And, in January , she started to experience tremors and what she describes as stroke-like symptoms, such as slurred speech. Since then, she has seen numerous specialists, who have given her a iety of dferent diagnoses. At one point, it was suspected she had multiple sclerosis- a condition that can affect the brain and spinal cord. At others, medics have thought she had everything from severe headaches and migraines to possible Chiari malformation, where the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. In the meantime, Louise says her symptoms have run riot, as she has experienced everything from slurred speech to agonising headaches and a suspected stroke, which led to numerous investigations, including MRI scans. Feeling increasingly isolated and depressed, for months she was in and out of AE with a host of related problems until desperate for help, in January  she saw an otologist - a specialist in ear diseases - who suggested she joined Facebook groups for people with similar symptoms for support.This was her eureka moment as, through members of a Facebook support group, she was told about a leading expert in her type of symptoms, at the Neuroinstitut in Barcelona, Spain. After examining her MRI and other scans and speaking to her, in April  he diagnosed craniocervical instability - meaning there is excessive movement between her skull and across most of the cervical vertebrae. He recommended spinal fusion surgery, which uses donor bone to strengthen the spine, and skull base decompression surgery - an operation that involves removing a small section of bone from the base of the skull. She also had a private consultation in this country, where she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome- a genetic form of hypermobility. Deciding to stick with these diagnoses, Louiseaposs obstacle now is finding the funding to go to Spain, so she can be treated by the surgeon she has so much faith in. Sadly, with two private operations, airfares and accommodation to pay for while she recovers, she needs £k for surgery and another £k for the additional costs. So, she has launched a GoFundMe page, appealing to kind strangers to help her fund the medical care that she is positive will save her le and eventually see her enjoying the first dance at her wedding. She said: Having the surgery would mean we’d get our lives back, so I can be there for my children and my fiancé. With everything we’ve gone through, it’s taken a massive toll on me, but also on my family, who have become my carers. We just want to go back to a normal le. It would be priceless. It would give us a second chance at le. We could have our dream wedding, which has been put on hold. I want to be a good mum again. I want to be there for my children. I used to dance with my kids every single day and I miss those precious moments so much.You can donate to Louiseaposs fundraiser here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Multiple sclerosisWedding dayCar crashesNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite a brief split in , the Duke of Cambridge proposed during a trip to Kenya and Kate said aposI doapos in April . But according to a royal expert, Kate started making subtle changes to her appearance before the engagement in .

I think that did come about because William and Kate were coming towards the point where they would announce their engagement. It was Kate starting to behave in ways which would be seen more appropriate for a future Queen.The couple made their first public appearance together at their university graduation from St Andrewaposs, which was attended by the Queen, Prince Charles and Carole and Michael Middleton.  Royal expert Victoria Arbiter adds: Graduation for William and Kate, it really was their last moment in that protective bubble. I think perhaps they might have both been a bit naive about what was to come. William understood how the media works but Kate would have had no idea what it meant to be on the receiving end. All eyes were on the prince, with an engagement announcement expected at any moment, however, it wasnapost until Kate made a surprise appearance at Williamaposs graduation with her parents that experts were  per cent sure she was aposThe One.aposBut it appeared William had reservations about his future with Kate.While many predicted that William would propose soon after the pair graduated in , it didnapost happen.And it wasnapost until many years later that William asked Kate to be his we, with his dad Prince Charles famously joking: They have been practising long enough.

But the car salesman was left stunned when his boss called to tell him to switch off his phone because the bill seems a little high. John said he nearly fainted when BT told him how much the GB of data heaposd used would cost. He told told The Sun : “My boss called and said you’re going to have to switch off the phone. The bill seems a little high.“I said ‘What is it ’ He said £,. Next day he phoned back and said, ‘Definitely switch it off, it’s now £,’.” Johnaposs boss Paul Trotter, , of AAA Performance in Rainford Merseyside, said he nearly fell off my chair when BT shared the bill. He added: It’s obviously a computer error. I’ve had a look at the bill and it shoots up £ every  seconds or so. That’s just not possible.“EvenJohn was downloading Hollywood blockbusters there’s no way he’d have gone that much over.” Because John is on a business contract, which includes just MB of data, no warning was given when he exceeded the limit. Paul added: “I was worried at first but I’m confident BT will realise it’s just an error. “John had a great holiday so there’s no harm done and we’ve even managed to laugh about it.” A spokesman for BT said they will erase the huge bill after Johnaposs story was made public. He said: “We understand this is a very signicant bill to receive, so, on this occasion, we are waiving the surplus roaming charges. “In this case, the customer was on a BT Business mobile plan which included a monthly data allowance of MB. When travelling in Turkey he far exceeded his agreed limit by consuming GB of data. We alerted him several times that he had exceeded his data allowances, that standard roaming charges were in place and that he was incurring high usage. Our records show that the customer chose not to include a data cap as part of his plan. “We always recommend customers opt for a roaming cap, as the vast majority of our business customers do.

The stretch of road in the village of Melbury Abbas, in north Dorset, is scheduled to be closed for five nights, to allow broadband fibre optic cables to be laid.But drivers are being threatened with a £, finethey attempt to use the closed-off road. People who need to travel between Melbury Abbas and Shaftesbury, just three miles north of the village, will have to drive  miles south before joining the A and going back on themselves. The ersionary loop will amount to a distance of around  miles in total and residents have said it will cause signicant delays to their journeys. The only other alternatives are along the tight bends and country lanes which are impossible for larger vehicles to navigate.  Jenny Weston, a local resident, said it would cause traffic chaos surrounding Melbury Abbas as motorists try to avoid the road closure. She said: This will probably cause chaos on the lanes and take longer to get to the destination in the process. One local resident said: Are locals really going to use this -mile ersion  It seems daft to have to drive so far to get to somewhere that is less than a mile away. Others have claimed it would be impossible for lorries to navigate the tight bends along aposZig Zag Hillapos, which is the only other route aside from the -mile ersion along the A.  Melbury Abbas has previously been dubbed the aposVillage of the Jammedapos as HGVs regularly get stuck along the narrow roads with an average of  jams a week. Alan Perry said: There is no way a lorry with a trailer will be able to navigate around the tight bends on Zig Zag Hill. Shirley Ball added: Letaposs hope no articulated lorries try the Zig Zag option. A local resident said: This will mean a great deal of traffic along Zig Zag hill and the A.

Shelley Wilcox cannot keep up with the rate at which mouldy spores grow in her damp home.She has been promised the rising damp and would be tackled and a broken front door when she bought the property, reports Gloucestershire Live.But despite decorating her home in Cotswolds, Gloucestershire with mould resistant paint and regularly cleaning the affected areas with bleach, the problems persist. Her housing provider, Bromford, has sent staff in the past to assess the damp situation, and as a result, Miss Wilcox, , claims she was told there were too many people breathing in the house.  She said: “The last straw was when my daughter went to find her dolls and she came to me so upset and distraught when they were literally covered in mould. I put the dolls in the wash and one had to go in the bin, the other one I am having to scrub in hope I can get the spores out of it for her. “The children and I have put up with the mould and problems in the property for seven years. “They tried to tell me it was because I have fish tanks but they finally admitted some time ago there is rising damp in the property. “When we moved in, I used mould resistant paint but even with that, I have ended up having to decorate my lounge five times in the past seven years. The mould is so bad it ruins the furniture and I am on my third sofa since I moved in.” She outlined a large number of issues in the property and claims the damp is spreading and mould is thriving because the cause of the problem is not being addressed. She said: “I have had to replace furniture, toy units, and even pots and pans. “The cupboards which are built onto the wall which meets the external wall are really bad with damp. The pots and pans just go so rusty quickly. “I wash everything before I use it, just in case. Before now, I have washed the pans and even then you were able to smell the mould coming from the baking trays.” Miss Wilcox feelsthe problems had been addressed as promised when she moved in, the issues would not have developed into what they are today. Rising damp, she believes is the main source of the problems, but not the only one. She said: “I need to get out of here. The damp proof course is not there. The corner of the front room where my little girl’s toy box is, that is where she found her doll and underneath it, the floor is peeling up and rotten from the mould. They have told where the damp proof course is, it is in the wrong place.” Miss Wilcox feels she has been told too many conflicting things by ious contractors, surveyors and Bromford housing officers. She said: “I have had people from Bromford come out to tell me ‘there are too many people breathing in the home’. What do they expect me to do with the children  Get rid of them ” After her eldest child moved out recently, the mum has four little ones living with her, two boys and two girls whose ages range from four months to seven years old. But she is worried they are being affected by the damp and mould. Miss Wilcox said: “I keep a really clean house. People who have come in to do repairs say how immaculate it is and it should be as I clean it every day, I am constantly cleaning and washing. But the baby and my -month-old little one seem to always have runny noses and are poorly. “It is just horrible living here. You walk into the living room and you would not think there is a problem but when I pull the furniture out you can see the mould. “The worst of the problem is in the bedrooms and by my sonaposs cot. “Bleach seems to be the only thing that gets it off but I get a headache from how often I am doing that.” Not only is the damp an issue, but condensation also builds up in the double glazing windows as the seals are also coming away. Miss Wilcox said: “For the past five years, I have not been able to open or close the bathroom window properly. It has been locked open the whole time. The extractor fan works but drips water on your head when you brush your teeth on the colder days. “I was promised as well when I moved and accepted the home I would have the windows, door and the external walls sorted but nothing has happened.”To add to the catalogue of issues, Miss Wilcox describes her front door as a ‘ fire hazard’.She said: “The door is so bad that in the winter it swells with damp so you cannot open it.Then, when the better weather comes along, you can see the cracks on the outside with daylight pouring in.Now I have had people visit at least four times to fix the door and they have not been able to. “I mentioned to one of the Bromford surveyors about how dangerous it was you could see daylight coming through and the door was weak and someone could break the doorthey kicked it. “Their reply was ‘you could break any door down nowadaysyou kicked it’. What good is that ” Miss Wilcox has been trying her utmost to maintain a clean and happy living situation but is desperate for change and a clean home for her family. She said: “I am trying so hard I feel a failure as a mum and I am so stressed. This home was meant to be perfect for us but is inadequate because of the promises that were broken. “I clean and clean all day and look after my children but I just feel like all of us are living in a dirty home.” The housing provider has apologised to Miss Wilcox for the problems she has been facing. Bromford’s associate director of localities, Dave Grinter, said: “I would like to apologise for the delays Miss Wilcox has experienced in trying to get these issues resolved. “We have been in contact with Miss Wilcox over the past week to try to finally resolve some of these issues for her. We have arranged an independent surveyor to her home todayto carry out another survey to identy the causes of the damp she has been suffering so we can find a permanent solution for them. We have already started to remove the ivy that is growing on her walls and will complete this work on Friday. “Twelve months ago, our neighbourhood coach assisted Miss Willcox in setting up an account on the council’s choice-based lettings so she could apply to move to a new property, due to being overcrowded in her current home. All our homes and those of other housing associations, are available to bid through this system and we would encourage her to do so to find a home that is more suitable to the size of her family.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ToysHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It will cost us, the taxpayer, £,. That’s the price of the civil service and police time spent probing No parties that should never have happened. The nation is rightly furious that the Prime Minister cared so little for the Covid rules he himself imposed that he put living it up before his duty to protect lives and livelihoods. Our PM gave not one jot about those who were forbidden from saying a final face-to-face goodbye to a dying loved one – or the family get-togethers we all did without because we were obeying his rules. Patsy Stevenson is angry too. She was fined £ for breaking lockdown restrictions to honour the memory of murdered Sarah Everard.  There was no cheese and wine at the vigil Patsy attended on London’s Clapham Common. Yet police pinned her down to arrest her, while ignoring food and booze pouring into No. The cost of the Partygate inquiry would be better spent on shielding women and girls from the kind of predator who snatched Sarah’s le away. And this investigation would not be needed had Mr Johnson and his staff accepted that rules also apply to them. This PM is on borrowed time. We will party – legally – when it finally runs out. A great honour for Camilla Camilla Parker Bowles may have been a skilled horsewoman, but she had a rough ride of it when she became Duchess of Cornwall. Many people could not forgive her for the part she played in the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage. But that was nothing compared to the fences the Queen had to jump within her own family while trying to maintain the dignity of royalty and respect for the monarchy. Both were tarnished when grandson Prince Harry turned his back on royal duties and skipped off to America to give a toe-curling interview to Oprah Winfrey, and strike ­embarrassing deals with Netflix.  It pained the Queen greatly when she had to strip her favourite son, Prince Andrew, of his titles as he faces accusations of sexual assault in a US court. But her duty to the nation demanded it, and the Queen has always put that before personal feelings. Throughout, Camilla has been steadfastly by the Queen’s side, her support in times of trouble. And just like the Sovereign, she negotiates the pathways of public le without putting a foot wrong – a ready smile and a kind word are always on her lips. The Queen is not one to ignore such loyalty and dedication. And today, as she becomes the first British monarch to reign for  years, she wants the world to know that when the time comes, Camilla will be called Queen Consort. We are delighted Camilla is to receive the honour. As they say in royal circles, she’s a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

Her -year reign has stretched from the post-war years through a new millennium and into a radically altered st century. She has served as a symbol of stability as the world has changed in countless social, cultural, political and technological ways over the intervening decades. Her Majesty also released a statement to mark the occasion - thanking well-wishers for their support and confirming she wants her daughter-in-law, Camilla, to become Queen Consort when Charles takes the throne. She wrote: It is a day that, even after  years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign. As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in  that my le will always be devoted to your service. As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth. I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family. I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign.

She has smuggled messages out for an ITV podcastShe wants to change her look and stand out from the other women at the camp Image: GB NewsByKelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter:,  Feb |commentsFormer ISIS bride Shamima Begum is selling food parcels to make enough money for western clothes and hair dye. She has claimed she wants to stand out from the other women at a detention camp who are still supporting the terrorist organisation, by changing her look.Ms Begum, who has been living in Al-Roj Camp in northeast since her UK citizenship was stripped in , has spoken to ITV News as part of a new podcast series, presented by Global Security Editor Rohit Kachroo. Shamima Begum: The Blame Game podcast looks at whether the authorities made errors that enabled the -year-old to travel to Syria with two other East London schoolgirls when she was just .She has made messages which have been smuggled out of the camp and sent to a filmmaker. In them she makes clear her despair at being left aposstatelessapos and describes how she has tried to recover from the trauma of losing three babies.  She said: “I’ve moved on from that part of my le, it doesn’t make me feel sad anymore. The podcast also hears from Richard Walton, the former head of Scotland Yardaposs counter-terror command, who led the police investigation into Ms Begumaposs disappearance. In his first interview about the case since leaving his post, he rejects allegations that police failures allowed the three young girls to make it to Syria. Mr Walton claims he led “a textbook investigation” and says faster action by the politan Police could not have stopped the schoolgirls from making it into ISIS-controlled territory.  He claims the girls’ journey to Syria was exploited by extremist organisations for their own purposes, to try and put the blame for this matter on the police. He added: It was not the police that decided to go to Syria. Hundreds of British citizens, including Ms Begum, were stripped of their citizenship by the British government. The podcast, which is out now, also hears from the former head of the United Nations special investigation into ISIS crimes, Karim Kham QC.  He calls for former ISIS members to be put on trial, like those at Nuremberg for Nazi leaders after World War Two. He said: The concern is not where. I really don’t care where the trials take place so long as a fair trial is possible. It’s obvious that it’s absolutely unacceptable and it’s not tenable to have iniduals in aposNo manaposs landapos.There’s no sieving between those iniduals that may be hardened Daesh members who are criminally responsible… and those that may be caught up in the conflict, be they battered wives or abused children.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ISISShamima Begum\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Grandma-of-five Irene Ferrie, , made the terrible choice of having her Springer Spaniel, Magners, put to sleep on January  after he sustained a serious leg injury. She opted to have the -year-old pooch cremated so she could scatter his ashes along the path of their favourite walk near their home in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the Daily Record reports.After paying Cambridge Pet Cremation £, with an extra £. for postage, she expected Magners ashes back within seven to  days. But by late last week, the remains hadnapost turned up, so she contacted the cremation company. They spoke to DPD, who relayed that the parcel had been left inside her blue paper recycling bin on January .But tragically bin men had had emptied it five days later on January .  She’s been left unable to sleep and is furious at the lack of communication from DPD - especially as her designated safe space was listed on the delivery instructions. A tearful Irene told the Daily Record: “It’s terrible, an absolute disgrace and completely shocking. I never got a single email or notication from DPD - not a thing. “Magner had a really sore paw and the vet advised us that the kindest thing was to have him put down on Thursday, January .  “I wanted to get him cremated so I could scatter his ashes on his favourite walk near the house. He was a Springer Spaniel and he absolutely loved running through the fields. “I was given the number for Cambridge Pet Cremation in Livingston and filled out the form. “It said on the bottom of the form that the ashes would be ed by a courier service and would require a signature upon delivery. “They said it could take between a week and  days. So I kept waiting to get an email or something to say he was on his way back home. “But when it got to over the ten day mark after the weekend, I decided to give the cremation place a call to see what was happening. “The girl from there called DPD to ask what was happening and she was told that it had been left with a neighbour. “So I went up to see them and they didn’t have anything. She even checked her own bins but I knew they had been lted on Sunday. “I’ve got DPD on an app on my phone and normally you get a wee notication telling you when your parcel is coming and who the driver was. But I didn’t get any. “When I opened it to double check, there was a picture of the parcel in the blue bin. So he’s away to be recycled. “I’m so frustrated and angry. I couldn’t sleep thinking about this because he’s been put in the rubbish like a piece of trash.” She added: “My nominated place was the greenhouse. Why did they put it in the bin  “There was no communication to tell me that he was getting delivered. And I certainly didn’t sign for it. It’s just shocking, so it is.” A spokesperson for Cambridge Pet Cremation said: “CPC are devastated to learn that the ashes of Ms Ferrie’s beloved spaniel Magners, have been misplaced by our courier company. “We acted immediately upon discovering this information yesterday and requested a full investigation, which we are awaiting information from. “We of course immediately refunded Ms Ferrie the full cost paid, and while this is the least we can do, this in no way makes up for this fundamental mistake. “CPC would like to offer their sincerest apologies to Ms Ferrie at this terribly sad time.”Ann Davie, Deputy Chief Executive, said, We were sorry to hear of this very sad incident and our thoughts are with Ms Ferrie.All of our recycling material goes to a third party contractor to deal with so unfortunately we are not in a position to search for the missing parcel.We have provided Ms Ferrie with the contact information for the contractor in the hope that they can help reunite her with Magneraposs ashes.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DogsTributesVeterinary Service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This marks Tammyaposs third pregnancy, with the gym expert already mum to son Wolf, six, and daughter Saskia, five.Sheaposs continued to share workout advice throughout her pregnancy, with vids showing her lting weights and keeping her back strong to reduce aches.Many have been left understandably puzzled by the clip, unable to work out where exactly the bump had gone or how she was even managing to do such a thing in the first place. A number of people wondered how the baby might be experiencing things, with one person exclaiming: BABY: WHY MY HOUSE IS BEING SMALL, SEND HELP, while another joked: Baby: aposmom I already told you I’m claustrophobicapos”. However, Tammy was quick to reassure her followers that what she was doing was perfectly safe, explaining that itaposs like hugging the baby.She added: I have to do it when I train, super good for your core doing it throughout pregnancy. Tammy is here trying an exercise known as the Bloom Method, which was first pioneered by Colorado-based pre and post-natal fitness expert Brooke Cates. When practising this method, pregnant women expand and contract their abdominal muscles using diaphragmatic breathing. The babies inside their wombs are pushed deeper into their abdomen as they inhale, and pressed forward as they exhale. Speaking with Today back in , Cates said: The reason the belly gets smaller is not because the woman is sucking in, but because sheaposs using her inner core unit.Sheaposs inhaling with the diaphragm as the belly gets bigger and then on the exhale, sheaposs lting through the pelvic floor and starting to wrap the transverse abdominal muscles — itaposs like sheaposs using her muscles to hug her baby.Have you got an interesting pregnancy-related story to share  Let us know in the comments or email us at yourmirror@mirror Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pregnancy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, posting their ad on the usual s didnapost help them find that special someone who would be the aposright fitapos. So they decided to take a very dferent approach.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Cliodhna, told how her gay best friend suggested they advertise the vacancy on Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people, which she did on Wednesday, February . And when the buying assistant woke up the next morning, sheaposd been inundated with hundreds of messages from prospective housemates.Sheaposd also inadvertently gone viral, as someone using the app had shared screenshots of the advert on Twitter, which garnered more than , likes and retweets.The -year-old, from Birmingham, West Midlands, said: We had a house with four girls and one of them was moving out.  We werenapost adamant that we wanted a male to move in, but we thought it would be a nice change to bring a bit of masculine energy into the house and change things up. It was never a discussion of aposoh we want a gay manapos, it was just aposoh we want a manapos. We had guys come to the house and it just wasnapost the right fit and I had a discussion with my gay best friend last night [WEDS] and was just saying we hadnapost found anybody yet and he was like aposwhy donapost you just make a profile and advertise on Grindr apos Iaposd never thought about taking that approach before. Obviously, weaposd had it up on SpareRoom so I didnapost really think anything of it and just made the profile. Cliodhna said she moved into her current house in Birmingham in August before -year-old hairdresser Ellis Henry and -year-old sales operation manager Shannon Creen joined her a month later.  She explained: Iaposve seen comments from people saying aposoh, these girls are just looking for a gay best friendapos and it wasnapost like weaposd sat around and been like aposoh my God, how can we become friends with a gay man apos It wasnapost like that at all. I suppose the whole process behind it was, a lot of my close friends over here are gay and we are very involved in the gay community so every weekend since Iaposve come over [from Ireland], weaposve gone out in the gay village in Birmingham. It just felt like exploring that option would be a good idea and a gay man would probably be a good fit. But in saying that, I did have guys message me on Grindr who said that they were straight or bisexual and asked aposare you just looking for a gay man apos and I made that clear aposno, we werenapost specically looking for a gay man, we were looking for anybodyapos. Our main thing is that we are a very social house. Thereaposs always somebody there, a lot of us work from home most of the time and we just want somebody whoaposs going to be that fit. I feel like Iaposve gotten so lucky in the house that Iaposve moved in at the minute that we all moved in and just clicked, and weaposre looking for that person thataposs outgoing, fun and going to fit in.  A screenshot of Cliodhnaaposs Grindr profile, which shared a photo of her alongside Ellis and Shannon, was shared on Twitter where it captured the attention of thousands.The advert read: Three girls in their mid to late s, young professionals, looking to fill a room in Moseley centre.

Another replied: Thataposs actually so cool esp considering how hard it can be for men and queer angels to find roommates sometimes. Marketing genius.

And with more people than ever turning to Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge to search for their special someone, itaposs important to know how to spot someone thataposs using another personaposs pictures to deceive their dates - also known as a catfish. A woman on TikTok named Jocelyn has shared her experience with a catfish in a video on her account, @jjustjocelyn, where she revealed she was planning to meet up with a Bumble match named Myles before a clue in his text messages set alarm bells ringing.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Jocelyn, from Ontario, Canada, explained that when she sent a text to Myles from her iPhone, the message was green - which indicated the number she was given was attached to an Android phone, as messages sent to other iPhones are blue. But in Mylesapos photos on his Bumble profile, he was clearly wearing an Apple Watch, prompting Jocelyn to do further investigation into who her date really was. She said in her video: I matched with this guy on Bumble, as one does. He was good looking, I was into it. I didnapost give him too much information about myself because Iaposve definitely chatted with people too much on the app.  He said we should get dinner sometime, and I thought that was great because obviously, I donapost want to talk in the app, I want to meet in person to seeI really like him. I give him my number and I say text me when and where we should meet for dinner. He texts me pretty quickly, and when I reply, I notice that itaposs green. Now, why does that matter  This is the guy I matched with. What is he wearing  An Apple Watch. What does green mean  It means he doesnapost have an iPhone.Jocelyn then said she stuck Mylesapos photos through a reverse Google Image search and found the pictures actually belonged to a model from New York named Ron - and not to the person she was talking to on Bumble.She added: I did a reverse image search of some of the pictures he used on his profile, and what do we have here  An Instagram model from New York! I live in Ontario, so thataposs not adding up.The guy I matched with is pretending to be somebody named Myles, not Ron, who is the actual guy thataposs in the pictures. Thankfully I had hardly spoken to this guy and Iaposd invested % of my time. Either way, stay woke ladies and stay alert. There are catfishes everywhere. And commenters on Jocelynaposs video - which has been viewed over  million times - were quick to praise the woman for her detective work. One person said: Good observation skills! And thanks for the tip. While another added: Youaposre basically a detective now. What a great catch. Jocelyn has even had a response from Bumble themselves, who have confirmed theyaposve removed the catfishaposs profile from their app. They said: We’re so sorry to hear about this! We’ve found the member and permanently removed them.If youaposre concerned about a potential catfish and want to double-check their photos for yourself, can perform a reverse image search by going to Google Images and clicking the camera icon, which allows you to either paste an image URL or upload a picture from your computer.

She said: “As a parent, you want to…make sure that they stay as a child for as long as they can because you don’t want them to be in this big, bad world, and she lost that, that was taken from her. “She’s probably going to have to be dealing with this for the rest of her le and we’re going to eventually have to find out everything that’s happened and we’re going to have to carry that as well.” Cleoaposs disappearance sparked a huge investigation and gained international attention. Terence Darrell Kelly, , was arrested on the same day Cleo was found and he pleaded guilty to forcibly taking a child aged under  at Carnarvon Magistrates Court.Appearing via video link from the high-security prison Casuarina Prison in Perth, he admitted his guilt and was referred to the WA District Court for a sentence mention in March. Cleo was awake and playing with cars when police found her at around am, Ellie said.  Police confirmed that the house was as it appeared in photos on social media with toys and dolls while Cleo told her mum that she could hear dogs barking, she added. Ellie also recalled the heart-wrenching moment she realised someone had my baby. “She was basically nowhere near me and that was the second I realised that someone had her and both my head and my heart connected to that, she said.  When the pair were finally reunited, Ellie said her daughteraposs first words were hi mummy. She said: “Cleo got onto the phone and she’s like ‘hi mummy’ and I was like ‘hi baby’. It was such a beautul moment.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON abductionCleo SmithAustraliaCrimeMissing persons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One plan under discussion is to parachute members of  Para and nd Airborne into Poland as a dramatic signal of defiance towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.  On Monday Mr Wallace yesterday announced another  soldiers will be sent to Poland. Speaking in London alongside his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak, the Army officer said “In that spirit of solidarity and helping share each other’s challenges of resiliences we will add to those  Royal Engineers by sending a further  British troops to Poland in a bilateral deployment to show that we can work together and send a strong signal that Britain and Poland stand side by side.” Two senior defence sources have told the Mirror the troops are “highly likely” to be paratroopers and that many of them will jump into Poland from C- troops carrier warplanes. One insider said: “This has not been absolutely finalised but these troops will very likely be from  Air Assault Brigade and they will very likely jump in.” Sources say it is many years since American and British troops parachuted together into eastern Europe, although they have done it more recently in the States. More than  members of  Para’s B Company are already in Estonia on winter warfare exercises with NATO units including soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment. It is believed members of  Para will be asked to join US airborne troops in demonstrating what the Army calls a Joint Forcible Entry, dramatically dropping into Poland. They are part of  Air Assault Brigade - the UK’s high readiness troops mostly made up of Paratroopers, with signallers, medics and engineers attached.  After jointly parachuting into Poland they would then launch a -day wargaming exercise - as a huge two-finger gesture to the Kremlin, whose troops are currently exercising in Belarus. Sources say the Parachute Regiment is “extremely keen” to perform the drop with the Americans but the MoD and Number Ten are concerned it may be over-aggressive. Senior Parachute Regiment officers have already put forward proposals to PJHQ and the plans are being considered. One source told the Daily Mirror: “The plan is to jump with the nd Airborne who have already arrived, but there is concern and confusion at senior level that any drop will be seen as aggressive and we are waiting for a decision.” The Paras are listed as the UK’s Global Response Force, are already part of an operational readiness capability which was formed with US forces in . More than  British Paras dropped into Ukraine in September , in a joint exercise with local forces and witnessed by the Daily Mirror. They parachuted last year into Jordan with local forces, practising how to battle ISIS and al-Qaeda in counter-terror strikes - an exercise watched by fascinated Russian embassy defence staff.  America has sent , airborne troops into Poland because of the escalating Ukraine crisis and the UK is sending more troops into Estonia.Around  other UK troops are training Ukraineaposs forces in how to fire NLAW anti-tank weapons which have been provided by the UK - with another  preparing for an evacuation.And scores of Special Forces Support Group and SAS troops are in Ukraine secretly preparing to help stranded Brits evacuate by land and airwar breaks out.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “There are currently no plans for  Air Assault Brigade to conduct a jump into Eastern Europe.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British ArmyEastern EuropeAl-QaedaNatoMinistry of DefenceVladimir PutinSoldiersArmed forcesSpecial forcesFitnessUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hundreds of rescuers worked tirelessly for five days to rescue Rayan Oram, five, who fell through the narrow opening of the well last Tuesday. On Saturday the world held its breath as the team, some of whom had been digging with their hands, finally reached him and brought him to the surface. The jubilation soon turned to tears when it was found little Rayan had not survived. Now Moroccan international footballer Abderrazak Hamdallah says he wants to buy the heartbroken family a new home to help with their despair.  The -year-old, who played under former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson after a move to Chinese Super League side Guangzhou, said: “We have gone through five very remote days and our hearts were snatched from us, Moroccans, all Arabs and Muslims, and even the whole world. “We praised and thanked God for everything that Rayan took, and he was more mercul to us and more deserving of it than us “With this affliction, I extend my deepest condolences to Rayanaposs family, and I ask God to grant them patience and solace.  “And I have decided, in my name and my family’s name, and in the name of all Moroccans and Muslims, to help and bring a little joy to Rayan’s family, his parents and his brothers and give them a fully equipped house. We ask God to accept us and make it in the balance of the good deeds of all Muslims “This is help from a brother to you and Godaposs mercy.”  The message comes after Rayan’s mother and father were given a guard of honour on Saturday night by rescuers. His mother, Ouassima Kharchich, said: This is Godaposs will. I thank all for their efforts to help. His dad, Khalid Awram, added: We thank so much the people and authorities... who helped us. Atiqua Awram, the little boy’s aunt, said: “My heart is aching for him.”  One social media user said of the gesture by Hamdallah, who played and scored against Newcastle in January: “This made me feel things I can’t describe.” Little Rayan fell into the well in the hills of Chefchaouen on Tuesday, triggering a huge rescue effort which was followed by millions around the world. The operation involved cutting much of the adjacent hillside and then tunnelling toward the bottom of the well to reach the child who was kept alive by food, water and oxygen lowered from the surface through a tube. Efforts were hampered by fears of landslides and there were cheers on Saturday evening when he was brought to the surface. Soon afterwards the worst was confirmed as a statement from Moroccoaposs royal palace confirmed he had not survived, with many rescuers bursting into tears.  An onlooker said: I heard people shout in jubilation after the boy was found thinking he was alive but then we learnt he was not. I never felt this sad.Among the onlookers was Bwa Sahraoui who dug with his bare hands for five days with limited rest and was among those who cleared the last few feet of rubble to reach the trapped boy on Saturday. He was cheered on social media as stories of his dedication were shared online. Pope Francis praised the people of Morocco for coming together to try to rescue the boy.He said: The people clung together, as a whole, to save Rayan, they worked together to save a child, the pope said during hisweekly blessing in St. Peteraposs Square.tried their best, unfortunately they did not make it.Also among well wishers to the family were French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, as well as football clubs including Liverpool, Manchester United, Barcelona and Sevilla who expressed condolences on their Arabic Twitter accounts.AC Milanaposs Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer added: Rayanaposs courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us. Ryanaposs funeral is believed to be scheduled for Monday.

The luxurious property, in an upmarket suburb boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms and world class views views of of one of Australiaaposs most famous landmarks. One of the propertyaposs biggest attractions is a aposmesmerisingapos m tunnel which took miners six months to excavate and even has some secret feature within it. Robert and Wendy Procter, brought underground workers from an opal mine in New South Wales to build the tunnel and during the build on the property in Mosman, Sydney.  The underground feature has attracted the attention of potential buyers after it hit the market with a  millionguide price. It has views over Sydney Opera House and the stone-walled tunnel even houses one of the cityaposs most coveted home gyms complete with a glass wall and wood flooring.Mr Procter told realestate.au : Itaposs a big house and the five of them stayed downstairs … the only thing we didnapost supply was alcohol which would have cost more than the tunnel. Described as very James Bond and high-tech by agent Jacqui Rowland of Di Jones Mosman, the stone tunnel stretches almost theof the entire plot and even has a gym in it. But it is the secret spy tunnel tunnel which has left potential buyers in awe of the property.It’s very James Bond and high-tech,” she told realestate.au. “You come out of the garage and walk into the tunnel, the lights come on and there’s music. It’s mesmerising.” The owners have been in the house for more than four decades but decided to build the underground channel to avoid walking  steps from the street to their house. Mr and Mrs Procter spent all of their million budget to create the game-changing tunnel leading from the double garage to a lt which comes to their home.  It means we donapost have to walk up  steps, which is particularly dficult in the pouring rain, Mr Procter said. Now the tunnel which can be accessed through the double garage goes past a subterannean workout area arriving at a the lt which brings users to their luxury home. In total, the project cost them around  million AUDbut the current owners love the addition.  As well as the wow which the tunnel brings viewers can also imagine themselves on its glorious sun balcony or visiting one of its many rooms or bathrooms.And thereaposs plenty of opportunity to enjoy the glorious weather, as the huge kitchen leads to a garden with a barbecue and entertainment area - as well as a heated pool and spa, sundeck and pond water feature.The estate agents realestate.au. say special equipment was used to bore through the stone.It says: The miners used jackhammers for the vertical lt shaft and a special machine that cut through the rock for the tunnel. He said including the lt and landscaping, there wasn’t much change from m for the work, which he says was well worth it. The views over the city are especially good at night when Sydney Opera House is lit up and can be seen from a distance.The outdoor space allows for some solace and is an oasis of calm in the midst of the bustle of the city.But the couple say the tunnel brings the added value and will see them make a tidy profit from their investment many years ago.  They put the grand mansion on the market for an eye-watering £million but only paid £, when they bought it more than  years ago. The property is on the market with DiJones, with expressions of interest closing on  February.

It is believed to be the latest attempt by Moscow to fabricate a threat of attack in order to justy the build-up to war whilst pretending to be fighting western-backed provocation. Last night a senior security source said: “It is such nonsense but people will believe such conspiracies and this is how it all plays out back home in Russia to justy war.  “This is all about justying an invasion but this time it does drag the UK into the plot, accusing it of backing so-called mercenaries in Donbas so it is ramping up pressure on NATO.” In a direct attack on the UK’s bolstering of security in Poland and training Ukraine troops in anti-tank warfare, it claimed the “Polish mercenaries” were British-trained. Russian media has reported that two groups of  “Polish-speaking mercenaries” had been identied on the front-line in Luhansk, according to one pro-Moscow separatist leader.  Lt Cold Eduard Basurin said during a conference held at a militia HQ in Donbas:“The presence of two armed assault groups of up to  fighters in mixed camouflage unorms has been noted in the zone of the Ukrainian th Mechanized Brigade.” It went to accuse the so-called ‘Polish mercenaries’ of attempting sabotage attacks but widened its deception campaign to the UK. According to quotes linked to Basurin: “The Polish mercenaries arrived in the area under the guise of instructors as part of the so-called Joint Forces formation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  “Before being sent to the Donbas, the members of these groups underwent military training under the guidance of British instructors. The Russian media even linked the so-called group of being members of extreme right groups in east Ukraine. In recent months Russia’s fake news squads have tried repeatedly to create a picture of Ukrainians being aggressive towards pro-Russians in the country. One video this week ly depicted a “Ukrainian” making a dirty bomb with which to attack Russian troops. The unprofessionally -made footage was unconvincing but sources say it is a sinister build-up to war against Ukraine and a possible invasion. It is believed this has been a bid to justy a war, full-on invasion or partial incursion into Ukraine.

Pluto is Alena’s longest resident at Nobody Dogs rescue centre and the sweetest boy. “The kennels and shelter is all he’s ever known,” she explained. “He has never left the ranch in the woods.” Alena describes Pluto’s personality as “very friendly and active”. “You wouldn’t know he is a senior dog,” she said. Pluto has never shown any signs of aggression, and gets on well with other dogs, cats and children. He walks well on a lead and would love to live with a family and kids in a rural space.  He has never heard any city sounds before or seen a television, so would need time and patience to adapt. Pluto has spent  years trying to find a place to call home, which has been a struggle for Alena. “We are a very small organisation and it’s dficult to adopt dogs in Romania. People don’t look at private centres,” she explained. While Pluto has lived a long and happy le so far at the rescue, it would be amazing for him to experience the rest of the world and find a permanent family. If you think you could be the perfect home for Pluto, please get in touch withNobody Dogs on Facebook.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

He discovered that an apprenticeship would help him achieve his dream of studying engineering – while working as an engineer. Abz is now in. He believes he has already gained extensive knowledge and hands-on experience in the rail industry. He is also studying for a university degree – funded by Siemens Mobility– and is earning at the same time.“I’ve learned the theory – and had the chance to apply it in the real world. I’m working at the cutting edge of technology and innovation, and I’m helping to solve some of the country’s problems in tackling emissions. Instead of building up debts, I’m being paid. What’s not to like ”Abz began his apprenticeship with Siemens Mobility in . He was keen to explore a mixture of electrical and mechanical engineering.In his first year, Abz studied mainly at college where he learned the basics of engineering. In the following years, he undertook a ‘rotation’ – a series of placements across a wide range of teams and locations. “I was able to experience first-hand all the disciplines of design, commissioning, manufacturing and project management – as well as working at site.”Abz currently has a key role in Siemens Mobility’s System Design Team where he’s working on traction power – supporting Scotland’s ambition to decarbonise its railway by . His work in the team helps find the right solution for the customer, in this case Transport Scotland. “It’s about problem solving. I’ve worked on feasibility studies, as well as working on options, which might be mixed – for example: railway electrication, combined with battery or hydrogen powered trains for a route that can’t accommodate overhead line electrics all the way.”Abz has also had the chance to explore the entire route involved in his team’s projects and has been able to see first-hand the real le impact his work will ultimately have.He’s excited about the potential for the technologies he’s working with. He says it’s not just about decarbonising, but about creating capacity for faster and more frequent trains – as well as cutting costs. “There’s no option but to tackle climate change, and decarbonisation is a key part of that. As a society, we haven’t been aggressive enough in cutting emissions. “I’m proud that I’m working on projects that will help get diesel trains off our railways – and allow more trains and faster trains. The railway will only rival flyingwe invest in technologies like electrication.”Originally from Leicester, Abz is delighted he’s currently working in Scotland where there’s a huge focus on hitting ambitious decarbonisation targets by . “If we’re going to hit those targets, we need to go further and faster with projects like the one I’m working on, as electrication projects take several years and bringing in new trains take around five to seven years. I’m excited by the thought that one day – in the not-too-distant future – I’ll be able to travel on a train down a route I’ve helped decarbonise.”This is the inspiration Abz wants to share with prospective apprentices. His own journey to becoming an apprentice wasn’t easy. While his family were supportive, he found that both his school and then college were sceptical about the value of an apprenticeship. “There are many out of date views about what apprenticeships today are really like. There’s still a sense that they are far removed from the action, mainly focussing on administrative or menial work – and that’s just not been my experience at all. The breadth of an apprenticeship is much bigger than many people think.”In contrast to the stereotypical view of an apprentice, Abz is working on innovative, real-le projects – including a power supply upgrade project on the East Coast MainLine between Edinburgh and Doncaster, and a project in Fe that could see a mixed solution of electrication and battery powered trains for the decarbonising of the route. Both involve UK firsts in terms of the technology involved. Abz also has words of wisdom for employers that might be considering offering apprenticeships. “We know there’s a skills gap in this country. We need to create chances for future generations to fill those gaps. “If companies can offer apprenticeships and don’t, they’re robbing themselves of the opportunity to bring in people who want to learn, innovate and make a dference – people who can help shape and drive companies now and in the future.” Abz feels he was welcomed by Siemens Mobility. “I found it easy to fit in and I’ve been encouraged to find my niche – including pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering at De Montfort University.”By the time Abz joined Siemens Mobility, he was the third cohort of apprentices to join the business for a four-year training programme. “By the time I joined, the company had achieved a good balance between providing structured learning, while also allowing apprentices a lot of flexibility in choosing the nature andof their placements. I’ve been able to extend my placement more than once when I’ve really got into the project I’m working on.”Abz feels he was allowed to deepen his experience and knowledge in the areas he felt most passionate about – while also being encouraged to explore things he didn’t necessarily gravitate towards initially. “Senior managers had a genuine desire to listen to apprentices and their opinions on how the scheme was run. I feel I’ve been offered flexibility and been given a voice.”Abz regularly shares his positive experience with future generations as he visits schools – including his own old school.“I think it’s really important that we raise awareness, change perceptions, and promote the benefits of apprenticeships. There are so many great things about them – for apprentices and for their employers.”He strongly recommends apprenticeships and has practical advice for anyone considering applying.“Find people who’ve already done it and ask them about their experience. You could even ask to shadow them and see first-hand what apprenticeships are really like. You won’t be disappointed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Their numbers are said to have reduced from around  to seven.Island management plans state that the long term goal is for “non-native species population” including flora and fauna to be reduced to zero or close to zero.Kirsty Young, the former host of Desert Island Discs, and her husband Nick Jones, , bought the island for £.million, in a deal announced last month.The couple have now confirmed that their preference would be to move them off the island.They are said to be acting on the advice of conservationist Chris Packham who cautioned against killing the animals and said it would be “no problem” to find them a new home.A spokeswoman for the couple said:  “Nick and Kirsty wholeheartedly agree with Chris Packham that the relocation of the very small population of wallabies would be a really good thing to do.“They’ll always be led by expert opinion and do what’s best for the island’s native ecosystem.”Mr Packham said shooting wallabies would “court controversy.” An online petition to save the animals has now reached almost  signatures.Interviewed by The Sunday Times, he said: “They may be non-native but they survived in dferent parts of the UK for decades and  and they have a culture value.“I applaud efforts to re-wild but you can’t blame the wallabies. “The way to do it is to catch the wallabies and move them where. I don’t think there would be any problem finding them a new home.“It’s more expensive and time consuming but it’s better than shooting them.”However, Craig Morrison, who is involved in the campaign to keep the wallabies on the island, likened the plan to “relocating Nessie”.He said: “These are wild animals, all born wild on the island of Inchconnachan, they are Scottish wallabies and deserve to stay on their island home. “Translocating the wallabies would put the animals under severe stress and is entirely unnecessary, the process in itself would represent a major risk to their lives.\"As i have stated before it is akin to translocating Nessie.”Kirsty Young and her husband have submitted plans to create a “world-class” habitat and tourist attraction on the site, which is recognised as an area of special scientic interest, as well as a short-term holiday home.  "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amNew Scapa Road in Kirkwall will be closed between Manse Road and Scapa Court for the next two weeks, Orkney Islands Councilhas confirmed.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions.

He was recently on crutches – I think he’s come off those crutches now and is walking normally, which is a big step.Eddie Howe on Callum Wilson:\"As always with these types of injuries its not absolutely clear. We go more on how he feels than a specic time given by physios or doctors. Its been slow progress for him – hes off crutches now and walking normally which is a big step.\" pic VhPKGJg— Newcastle United FCFebruary , “But you can see by that update that I’m giving you it’s quite slow, so we all wish Callum to come back as quickly as possible, but when he comes back, he’s got to be fit and ready to give his best, so we’re helping him with that, day to day.“But I don’t think it’s going to be short-term. Hopefully he can make the last few games of the season and really help us in the key moment.”Wilson’s absence will come as a huge blow to the relegation-threatened Magpies, who invested £million of their £m January spending spree in Burnley frontman Chris Wood but failed in their attempts to further boost their firepower as their pursuit of Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard and Stade de Reims’ Hugo Ekitike came to nothing.Howe added: “He’s gone away, he’s having intense treatment. We’re trying to give him the best care that we can as a football club.✊ | A 𝗕𝗜𝗚 gameweek ahead:Tue: Newcastle Sat: Leeds #MondayMotivation 🔵 #COYB pic EHqbuAWMcM— EvertonFebruary , “I’ll probably be better updating you further down the line as to adate, but at the moment, that’s unclear.”In the meantime, the Magpies will run out against Frank Lampard’s men sitting th in the table but just a point off safety, although Everton’s - FA Cup fourth-round win over Brentford on Saturday underlines the dficulty of the task ahead.Howe said: “I fully respect Frank and know him well and I think he’s an outstanding manager.“They have a strong management team and they have a strong team on the pitch, so we know we’re going to have to be, as always in every Premier League game, at our very best to win.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are clear that mocking the atrocities of the Holocaust is unacceptable.”The Government was focused on “making sure that streaming services are more accountable”, he added.Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries previously suggested new laws via the Media Bill could hold to account streaming sites for airing jokes such as those made by Carr.Anti-hate groups such as the not-for-profit organisation Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and The Auschwitz Memorial have condemned the comedian for the joke.The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, has also launched a petition calling for Netflix to remove the segment of the programme “which celebrates the Romani genocide”.It said the joke in question was “truly disturbing and goes way beyond humour”. vw,vw,px, px\"Health Secretary Sajid Javid criticised Jimmy Carr On Monday morning, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Times Radio the joke was “horrid”.He added: “I think we all have a right to react to that, and one of the best ways anyone can react to that is show these s what they think about Jimmy Carr by not watching or listening to him, and that will send him a very strong message.”Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP for West Dunbartonshire, said he was “utterly dumbfounded” by Carr using the Holocaust to “poke fun at one of the most marginalised groups in these islands, the Roma and Gypsy community”.He suggested the House of Commons should have an opportunity to hold a debate to recognise the “value and worth” of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community across the UK and to “raise them up, not to put them down”.Carr issued a “trigger warning” to the audience at the beginning of his Netflix special and told viewers it contained “terrible things”.According to The Mirror, he appeared to address the controversy during a performance at the Whitley Bay Playhouse on Saturday night.Discussing so-called cancel culture, he told the audience: “The joke that ends my career is already out there.”Netflix declined to comment.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Populations became more economically resilient, he said.The cost of using the Faroese tunnels was at first around the same as a ferry journey but over time as usage increased, tolls were slashed to less than a fth of that.Now, Mr Lamhauge said the debate was about whether to cut the tolls altogether.The meeting also heard questions from pupils at Mid Yell and Whalsay schools as well as input from some of the  or so people viewing the debate.Among the biggest subjects for debate was where would the first tunnel be builtMr Lamhauge said it took around  years to get such projects going.The Shetland Times.Here in Norway toll roads is common to finance such projects#get the funding from the Scottish Gov and get on with it.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailHolyland residents have instructed a Belfast law firm to consider taking immediate legal action against the PSNI, the Department for Justice and the city council in an effort to stop anti-social behaviour in the area.Phoenix Law’s Darragh Mackin confirmed a number of residents in the south Belfast area are looking to “challenge the current regime in place”.The Holyland area has been plagued for years by anti-social behaviour from both young people and a minority of university students moving into the area.Almost  young people gathered for a street party during Freshers’ Week in September, resulting in three arrests and more than , bottles of alcohol being confiscated by police.The PSNI increased patrols in the Holyland during Freshers’ Week and St Patrick’s Day, handing out a number of Covid notices. But the problems continued to persist.Police were also investigating an incident in October where footage on social media appeared to show a group of iniduals throwing a plant pot at a resident’s car.Phoenix Law partner Mr Mackin stressed the potential legal action is aimed at protecting permanent residents in the area by ensuring safeguards are in place.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This is not a situation whereby it is residents against students as often inferred,” he told the Belfast . “In fact, it is the very opposite. The reality is the residents have been, and continue to be, let down by the ineffective practices and procedures in place to protect those iniduals who live in the area.“It is the worst kept secret that there continues to be illegal occupation of multiple person properties with little or no review or investigation.“Further, the area continues to produce high levels of anti-social behaviour with limited and intermittent policing response.”Mr Mackin added that residents have been left to fend for themselves “for too long”. “We are now instructed to consider immediate legal action against both the council, the department and the PSNI for failing to ensure the necessary protections and safeguards are in place for those residents who we represent,” he stated.Long-time residents’ campaigner Brid Ruddy, who is one of the Holyland residents involved in the case, welcomed the expected legal action. She agreed with Mr Mackin that the issues in the area are not “a tussle” between dfering lestyles of residents and students, but a failure by relevant agencies to put an end to noise complaints, fly-tipping, anti-social behaviour and houses of multiple occupancy .“Yes, a lot of the anti-social behaviour comes from a minority of students who are a disgrace to the student body, because not all students are like that, but the cause of it is the total failure by the agencies to really look after this area,” stated Ms Ruddy.“It has been left to degenerate into an HMO slum.”Reflecting on the trouble within the Holyland over the past year, Ms Ruddy said it never gets any better and now occurs seven days a week. She added that people go to the area to party because “they know there will be no repercussions” and said the “absurdity of it all” was highlighted when a communal Christmas tree installed by residents was stolen in early December.“The police and council just keep saying they’re working in partnership models with others,” said Ms Ruddy. “The partnership model doesn’t work. We can’t keep on doing the same thing and expecting a dferent result.”The PSNI, Belfast City Council and the Department for Justice all said they have not received any correspondence relating to legal proceedings.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandBelfast City CouncilDepartment of JusticeMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandNineteen PSNI officers suspended amid sexual misconduct investigationsAntrim man doused with heating oil during arson attack on his homeHate crime rises in Northern Ireland with racist incidents showing biggest increasePolice seeking owner of horses found near Downe hospitalPSNI investigating Twitter troll after threat to rape Belfastjournalist’s daughter Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs making big waves in the world of businessDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man Brendan McMullan warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandRise in number of sexual offences reported in NIAmnesty International calls for historical abuse apology amid political turmoilWomandies following Glengormley crashMan accused of headbutting female PSNI officer in Belfast refused bailMajor challenges for justice with proposed budget cuts, Long warnsLatestRise in number of sexual offences reported in NIScotland ‘know they can get better’ after beating England in Six Nations openerPolice step in as Sir Keir Starmer targeted by mob near ParliamentKatie Taylor sidesteps opponent Amanda Serrano’s call for  three-minute roundsNewcastle close in on Dan Ashworth as they prepare for key Everton game,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapArchiveContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsContributor TCA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"over 3000 civil service agency staff waiting for 17m in back pay","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

The Department of Finance handles personnel issues for the NICS.Pay awards for  and  were reflected in pay scales published last June, but thousands of agency workers are still waiting to receive these pay increases.Responding to an Assembly question, Mr Murphy said that, based on the estimated , agency staff awaiting the  pay award, the average back pay owed is £. This means the estimated total owed in back pay is around £.m.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It is the responsibility of the Civil Service’s contracted recruitment agencies to pay their employees the appropriate rates of pay and manage any pay adjustments or claims for back pay during the contract term, Mr Murphy said.NICS HR officials in my department continue to support the recruitment agencies to complete the remaining calculations of back pay due to their employees.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “The Executive parties have sometimes referred to the cost of living crisis, but the truth is, they have done very little to protect people in the midst of one.It is shocking that at a time when the cost of food, energy and other household items are through the roof, Finance Minister Conor Murphy still hasn’t acted to ensure agency workers are paid the average of £ that they are still owed. The minister has tried to repeatedly evade responsibility for acting on this, but ultimately it’s his departmentthat are funnelling millions into the coffers of these agencies.“It’s worth seriously thinking about how much this owed money would assist low and underpaid workers to afford to heat their homes or to pay for the weekly shop at a time when the cost of both is rising through the roof.”In addition to the estimated , agency staff awaiting the  pay award, there are also , workers waiting for last year’s pay rise.Announcing pay parity for NICS agency workers in October , Mr Murphy said: “As is the case in many organisations, agency workers play a key role in the Civil Service and the delivery of services. Under this new contract, agency workers will have parity with Civil Service permanent colleagues in terms of pay, annual leave and paid time off for medical and dental appointments from day one.“The Civil Service is committed to looking after the health and wellbeing of all those working in the NICS. I believe these enhanced arrangements for agency workers demonstrate our commitment to workers’ rights.”Last summer, a report found that an average of . days were lost per NICS staff member in the previous financial year, representing .% of the available working days. This is down from an average of . days the previous year.The NICS absence level for   was the lowest recorded in more than  years. Related topicsConor MurphyDepartment of Finance Gerry CarrollMore On Conor MurphyUnionists alienated and instability increased by NI Protocol, Orange leaders tell Taoiseach Premium, Northern Ireland civil servants still waiting for pay increaseStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU funding PremiumSam McBrideOpinionSecrecy and power: What Sue Gray’s two NI sojourns reveal about her PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in fundingMost ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs making big waves in the world of businessDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man Brendan McMullan warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandAmnesty International calls for historical abuse apology amid political turmoilWomandies following Glengormley crashMan accused of headbutting female PSNI officer in Belfast refused bailMajor challenges for justice with proposed budget cuts, Long warnsCovid-: what are the remaining restrictions in Northern Ireland LatestNewcastle close in on Dan Ashworth as they prepare for key Everton game‘England’s oldest pub’ to reopen as soon as possible after closing due to CovidTeenager charged with on-pitch assaults during Forest-Leicester FA Cup clashFuneral held in Morocco for five-year-old boy who was trapped in wellAmnesty International calls for historical abuse apology amid political turmoil,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A lot of people drive down and park on the beach. It was meant to be after high tide,” she said.“We have enough experience on that beach – you think we’d know better, but we walked up to go and get a coffee and the waves were coming right in, past the coffee area right at the top there.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All the cars were getting completely swamped, there were a few animal baskets getting dragged away, luckily there were no animals in there, all animals were safe.“It was just crazy.“There were a group of ladies going in for a swim and a few of us were a bit concerned. We were saying ‘Be careful, maybe don’t go in or,you are, maybe don’t go too deep’. Then that surge came in, just before they went into the water, thank goodness, it would have been enough to take them off their feetthey had been in.”Anna said people need to be wary of strong currents.“The pull is so strong back out again,” she added.“That is why we have been putting up messages on social media for people to stay out of the water oryou are going into the water make sure you do an appropriate risk assessment and don’t go in far. I would just say don’t go in, to be honest.“When you first drive down you don’t think it is so bad but the waves out far are really big and they are breaking really big.“We drove round to Portstewart as well and because the waves are breaking so close to shore you can see the size of them.“I know the reports are that it is going to be building all day. Hopefully the surges won’t be coming up quite as far with the tide going out.”Locals said the surging waves can happen frequently.A spokesperson for Maritime and Coast Guard Control based in Bangor said further wave surges were expected into the afternoon yesterday, but the worst had passed.They encouraged the public not to put themselves into danger attempting to capture any photographs, never to turn their back on waves and to “stay high and stay dry”, by keeping away from dangerous and rough sea conditions.Most ReadWatch: Surging waves engulf cars at Benone StrandBBC NI rejects Arlene Foster’s claim broadcaster is an ‘opponent’ of the DUP under : Meet the best and brightest NI entrepreneurs making big waves in the world of businessDrunken NI student ‘obnoxious and entitled’: Craigavon man Brendan McMullan warned by judge after sex assaults on two womenDonna Traynor discrimination case against BBC set to open on ThursdayTop VideosPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayHealth Minister Robin Swann pressing ahead with plans to ease Covid- regulationsPlayFamilies of bookies atrocity vow to fight for justice on th anniversaryLatest Northern IrelandRise in number of sexual offences reported in NIAmnesty International calls for historical abuse apology amid political turmoilAnne Browndies following Glengormley crashMan accused of headbutting female PSNI officer in Belfast refused bailMajor challenges for justice with proposed budget cuts, Long warnsLatestRise in number of sexual offences reported in NIScotland ‘know they can get better’ after beating England in Six Nations openerPolice step in as Sir Keir Starmer targeted by mob near ParliamentKatie Taylor sidesteps opponent Amanda Serrano’s call for  three-minute roundsNewcastle close in on Dan Ashworth as they prepare for key Everton game,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building. A date for the event has yet to be confirmed.On February  at the Newcastle Community Cinema, Film Hub NI is inviting families to a special screening of lsquoThe Snail and the Whalersquo, a joyous, empowering story about the natural wonders of the world and discovering that no matter how small you are, you can make a dference.And to coincide with this special screening, NI Science Festival has organised an interactive seashore adventure with Beach Schools NI which will take place a short walk from the cinema and is included in the ticket price.Festival director, Chris McCreery, said the event exists to engage audiences, stimulate discussion, and ignite interest in the wonders of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.ldquoWe are confident that this yearrsquos erse programming will expand the horizons of festival goers of all ages and abilities across Northern Ireland, he added.The Science Festival is supported by the Department for the Economy, Belfast City Council, Tourism NI, Derry City and Strabane Council, Queenrsquos University,Ulster University, British Council Northern Ireland, MCS Group, The Open University NI, Innovate UK, Matrix NI, Film Hub NI and Arts and Business NI..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 5%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash The Downe Hospital has been identied as the possible site of a new police station in Downpatrick.The Police Authority has expressed an interest in the large site in a move which would pave the way for the construction of a new Downe Hospital, utilising Lecale House and the Maternity Hospital as the core buildings on the Ardglass Road.The present Downe Hospital, medical assessment unit and nurses home would then be completely demolished to make way for a new police base.Police Authority officials toured the hospital complex before Christmas and are reported to be impressed with both the size of the site and its central location.The officials have also held informal discussions with representatives of the Eastern Health Board who are also believed to be attracted to the plan.The revenue generated by the sale of the massive complex would go a long way to paying for the construction of a new hospital which politicians have called for on numerous occasions.A spokeswoman for the Police Authority said it is not normal policy to comment on such matters, and she added that there is still a commitment to build a new police base on the Ballydugan Road.Although the Authority has obtained outline planning permission for the Ballydugan Road site, it is believed that the nature of the land and the potential size of the highly fortied station is causing concern.Publicly the Authority is pressing ahead with plans to build there, but behind the scenes it has continued to look at possible sites in ious town locations.The Downe Hospital has now emerged as the surprise front-runner although evensuch an ambitious plan is approved, it will be many years before a police station is operational on the site.ARDGLASS ndash A special sub-committee has been set up by Down District Council to consider the European Communityrsquos review of the common fisheries policy.The committee is to be empowered to provide a response to the document.Ardglass SDLP councillor, Mr Dermot Curran, said some of the systems that were being introduced by the EC are not very helpful to the people employed in the fishing industry. Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task. It will be consulted on any designations or proposals by government or local government relating to the area, including the marine nature reserve..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Gibney’s Hoops double  ","story":"IT was a case of what could have been for Killough, as Celtic Bhoys capitalised on opportunities to stay in the race for the title on Saturday.From the refereersquos first whistle it was a heated event at Ballyhornan with both sides looking to grab possession.The advantage of the wind was with Celtic Bhoys in the first half, and it was a minor error by Killough goalkeeper, James Crangle, in the fourth minute that gted Jay Gibney his first goal of the game.Cranglersquos kick out went direct to the striker and Gibney made no mistake with his finish.The Killough players looked more driven by this and showed great character supporting their goalkeeper to get his head back into the game. Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point. Team-mate Devlin then converted a free to pile on the pressure.Opposing number eights, Dylan Ward and Ian Maguire, were having a notable midfield battle which drew attention fromboth sets of supporters on numerous occasions but often it was the Kilcoo man coming out on top.lsquoKeeper Kane kicked an effort off the ground and over the bar on the rd minute before Eugene Branagan scored a point from play to give The Magpies the lead.As was the theme of the contest, Sherlock knocked over a brace of frees for the Munster champions and the score line swayed once more.Daryl Branagan curled two points from play over the bar before Ryan McEvoy was shown the yellow card for a foul on the opposition. Sherlock duly converted the resulting free and now the game was in its last ten minutes of regulation time.Ward received a yellow card for more off the ball antics with Maguire but Kilcoo kept on scoring through the left boot of Devlin, who split the posts after receiving a neat pass from Daryl Branagan.As the officials indicated four additional minutes, The Magpies held a narrow one point lead with the scores reading - to -.On the rd minute, The Barrrsquos were afforded the chance to draw level from a long ranged free which Sherlock made no mistake in doing.With seemingly one lastthrow of the dice, Kilcoo launched the ball forward to the experienced Devlin, who drew the foul as he attempted to pick up the pass.With what everyone thought was the final kick of the game, Devlin prepared to knock over his free and send his side through to a second successive All-Ireland final.However, there would be one last twist before the whistle.To everyone in attendance and those watching at homersquos disbelief, Kilcoo joint-captain Aidan Branagan, who was only on the pitch for a matter of minutes, needlessly collided with Barrrsquos replacement Adam Lyne off-the-ball.After brief deliberation, referee Cawley gave Branagan his marching orders in the form of a red card and reversed his decision from a free to a throw ball.The full-time whistle sounded seconds later and the game headed to extra-time.Despite the high drama, Kilcoo would not be denied and dominated the following duration of the contest.Custodian Kane was first to kick over, before Anthony Morgan doubled the deficit. Sherlock pulled one back for The Barrrsquos from a free but Micheal Rooney quickly cancelled this out at the other end.Devlin extended the lead to three and yet again Sherlock proved reliable for The Barrrsquos through a converted free.However, Kilcoo clearly had prepared for these extraminutes and scoring opportunities looked to be seldom for their opposition, although Colm Barrett did split the posts after Devlin curled over another point.lsquoKeeper Kane saw his rsquo sail over the bar to restore a two point lead and from here St Finbarrrsquos ran out of gas.Jamie Burns saw red for the Cork side after punching out at Doherty, and Kilcoo were now afforded the extra space to stamp their authority in the closing minutes.Despite Ward picking up a late black card, a brace of Doherty points rounded off the scoring as the match finally reached its climax at - to -.After the contest, Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane spoke about his sidersquos performance and reaching yet another All-Ireland final.ldquoWe knew it was going to be tough when you get to the last four in Ireland, he said.ldquoYes everybody was saying Kilcoo were going to be red hot favourites, but deep down we knew St Finbarrrsquos are no walkover and they proved that.ldquoItrsquos only a semi-final, therersquos nothing won yet so we are back at it in the morning, get our recovery and training Monday night.St Finbarrrsquos: J Kerins S Ryan, J Burns, C Scully C Lyons, B Hennessy, A OrsquoConnor I Maguire, Eoin Comyms D OrsquoBrien, S Sherlock , B Hayes C Myers-Murray , E McGreevy , C McCrickard.Subs: E Dennehy for C Myers-Murray, C Barrettfor D OrsquoBrien, M Shields for E McGreevy, A Lyne for C McCrickard.Kilcoo: N KaneN Branagan, R McEvoy, Aaron BranaganM Rooney, D Branagan , E BranaganD Ward, Aaron Morgan C Doherty , J Johnston, S JohnstonC Laverty, R Johnston , P Devlin .Subs: Anthony Morganfor Laverty, Aidan Branagan for Aaron Morgan, C Laverty for Aidan Branagan, T Fettes for R Johnston, J Clarke for M Rooney.Referee: Brendan Cawley ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Death.jpg","title":"Marc (18) remembered as ‘an unassuming and polite young man’  ","story":"THE funeral of a teenager who died in a road accident near Castlewellan at the weekend takes place later today.Marc Quinn died after being struck by a car on the Newcastle Road in the early hours of Sunday morning.It is believed that Marc, who celebrated his th birthday last Wednesday, was walking home when the accident occurred shortly before .am.He was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, but sadly died a short time later.Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.The funeral cortege will leave Marcrsquos home in Annsborough today at .pm for Requiem Mass in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan at pm, to be followed by interment at St Maryrsquos Cemetery, Aughlisnafin.Marc was a talented Gaelic footballer who was a senior player for Aughlisnafin GAC.His mother, Jenny, is the club secretary, and his father, Garry, is a former player.

The tactic looked like paying off, but at the post So Ladylike, with Caoimhe OrsquoBrien in the saddle, got up to provide the rider with her second success, her first coming on this Alana McGuinness-owned runner back in October. Ballinasilla finished a close third.The winner is trained by Ian Donoghue, a brother of top Northern Ireland jockey Keith, who is no longer with Gordon Elliott.Only six of the  entries took part in the Dennison JCB Maiden Race for five year-old geldings, but the race provided spectators with a close finish.The Aaron Sinnott-ridden Song For My Father, owned and trained in Co Cavan by Shane Donohoe, just passed the judge ahead of Time For A Pint, ridden by Tom Hamilton for Co Carlow trainer Shark Hanlon, with Hapy La Vie back in third ahead of Old Style Humor.It was not long before a stewardsrsquo enquiry was called with the result that the winner was disqualied for failing to draw the correct weight. Time For A Pint was placed first ahead of Hapy La Vie and Old Style Humor .Four set out in the Kingsfield Stud five year-old Mares Maiden Race, but only three remained after the fourth fence, after Paddy Cleary lost his irons and was unseated.This left Born Famous to win from Famous Function and local hope Social Distancing. For trainer Claire OrsquoConnell it was a welcome winner. Paul Bannon was the successful rider.The Cosy Roof Open Race saw the grey Creadan Grae make most of the running but in the end had to be content with second to the ex-English trained Brain Power mdash a rare open horse for Warren Ewing, who is best known for producing top four year-olds.The successful rider was Maghera-based Oran McGill who was replacing his injured younger brother Dara. Warren is part of the well known fish merchant family. Third home was Bajan Excell, ridden by Ben OrsquoBrien.The connections of the runner-up in this race, Broughshane owner Philip McBurney, rider Noel McParlan and trainer Gerry Quinn, also based at Broughshane, had better fortune in the Armstrong Auctions  year-old and Upwards Mares Maiden when Tamlaght Eyes, pulled up in her previous three races, proved to be the smooth winner from the Lee Shawagen-ridden Any Time with Castle Arms Casa a very close third.The final race on the card was the G Curran  Co Ltd Maiden Race for  year-old and Upwards Geldings. Ask Charlie was the easy winner from Kilmoganny, ridden by Tiernan Power-Roche, and Robbie Armstrongrsquos ex-English trained Carolersquos Templer, ridden by Deckie Lavery.Good to see the long established Denis Reddan colours in the winning enclosure. Ridden by Ben Harvey, the winner is trained by his father, William.Perhaps the result may have been dferent had Paul Bannon not become unseated at the final fence of his mount Butcher Barry.Best turned out in all races as usual was courtesy of Glencairn Stables.Acting stewards: Rev Colin Hall-Thompson, Max and Margaret Evine and David Aiken.Ballee jockey Toni Quail, out of action with a broken ankle as a result of a schooling accident, was helping with declarations at the meeting.A tribute was paid to the late Maurice King who for many years was a vet at the meeting.The next meeting at Tyrella is on Saturday, March . Prior to that, the North Down meeting at Kirkistown will take place on February . First race is at pm. The same evening the East Down Hunt Ball will take place at Ballydugan Mill.Victor Reid, a long time owner and breeder along with his late we Margaret, sadly passed away suddenly at hospital on Friday.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Under Apartheid South Africa, the black majority did not have the right to vote. In Israel itself all citizens including its growing Arab population can vote, even for parties opposed to Zionism.

Israel maintains a free press that is often ferociouslycritical of successive governments’ behaviour towards the Palestinians.On the coast, activists run an underground network smuggling young gay Palestinians into cities like Tel Aviv, where they can be free. Meanwhile Palestinian governments continue a policy of separate development from their closest neighbour. Take the Covid pandemic, when Israeli scientists were among the first to develop vaccines to fight the virus. These vaccines were offered free of charge to the Palestinian Authority which opted for a Russian iety instead.And speaking of apartheid, anyone who has travelled in the Arab and Islamic world will note women are often second-class citizens. The maltreatment of religious minorities from the Gulf to Pakistan too could be described as a form of ethno-religious apartheid.Amnesty is entitled to criticise inidual policies of Israeli governments, but the slur of ‘apartheid’ is merely an enabler to those who want to destroy the Jewish state and its people.For more opinion pieces and letters, click here: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey crossed the busy A and followed a track for the slippery descent where the old set of steps have finally disintegrated and through bare autumnal woodland onto part of the Ridgeway Golf Club, where the ground was glistening white with a thick carpet of overnight frost. After waiting for three golfers to complete the hole they moved on locating their first stile in woodland which led into fields containing sheep as the sun put in an appearance.A descent led them to the ruined buildings and old stable block at Cefncarnau-fawr along with a mysterious ivy clad ruined building, where they deviated along a narrow muddy track in woodland to enter fields, where boots crunched over frozen uneven mud as they approached a stile leading into Coed-y-wenallt.A wide wet and muddy pathway populated with dog walkers led them to a wooden footbridge and across the fast flowing Nant Cwm Nofydd for the climb up to Rhiwbina Hill and a short road walk before turning into Fforestganol.A steep climb past water gushing down the bare hillside in small waterfalls led them through Heol y Forest and along a rough track carpeted with autumnal leaves with shadows of the surrounding bare trees silhouetted on the ground. Then downhill through part of Fforest-fawr where natural resources like limestone, coal and haematite, an iron rich mineral which were abundant in this area were mined. So many of the hollows and mounds to be found within the woodland are the result of shallow workings and spoil tips, many of which are now hidden beneath vegetation.The path eventually brought them out at the bottom of the main driveway leading uphill to Castell Coch, or the red castle and stopping to utilise fallen tree trunks for seating, they enjoyed morning refreshments whilst gazing at the fairy tale castle. Actually built on the remains of a th century castle this th century Gothic style folly, standing above the steep Taff gorge was built by William Burgess for the rd Marquis of Bute, although sadly Burgess died ten years before the project was complete..removeRefreshed, another climb led them uphill and further into Fforest-fawr where they descended a wide pathway to the valley bottom to join part of the Taff Trail along the flat disused railway line. Then another climb, this time on narrow muddy pathways through bracken to zig zag gradually uphill to the open hillside overlooking Taffs Well and Gwaelod y Garth in the valley below and up through the Taff valley towards Rhydfelin and Pontypridd.The last haul brought them to the summit of Craig yr Allt with its panoramic views including towards its sister hill the Garth and the reward of a sit down for lunch under overcast skies, whilst gazing towards the coast at Penarth Head and out across the misty Bristol Channel. Continuing along the ridge and making their descent to a road, a short journey led them back into fields containing passive horses as they trekked through mud to Waun-waelod.One last climb up through a waterlogged narrow track between bramble bushes led them out onto Caerphilly Common as the sun ed, for the short climb to the trig point at m on Caerphilly Mountain to enjoy the views over Caerphilly in the valley below with its ruined castle clearly visible.All that was left was the short descent passing many other people who were out with dogs and children enjoying the afternoon sunshine and views, to make their way back to their start point after a lovely . mile undulating tramp.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The visit was hosted by the Parliament of Ghana, UK High Commission, and other key partners.We were given a warm welcome and held candid discussions on issues including Covid, conflict and climate matters. We met local women traders and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as MPs from countries across Africa and other key figures. There were lots of discussions about how they view the UK and our mutual partnerships going forward, how we tackle global challenges, and how we fight for human rights and gender justice together.After arriving back in the early hours, I was then straight back into Westminster for anFriday sitting in Parliament – a very important one – as I joined other MPs to support my colleague Rosie Cooper MP’s British Sign Language Bill, which aims to make BSL an official language of the UK.I had a chance to thank local BSL interpreters and deaf community activists, saying: “I add my wholehearted support to this Bill. Like many hon. Members, I have campaigners in my own constituency, such as Stuart Parkinson, an activist for the deaf community with Cardf Deaf Centre, but I also pay tribute to the work of the Association of British Sign Language Teachers and Assessors. Interpreters such as Julie Doyle and Tony Evans can be seen on Welsh Government broadcasts, live with the First Minister and Health Minister, interpreting in BSL in real time in the room, and I pay tribute to them for the work they have done for the deaf community and in supporting this Bill.”.removeWhile we are thankfully now back at Level  Covid restrictions in Wales, it’s important we continue to keep up the effort on vaccinations and boosters – soyou haven’t had yours, please arrange to do so as soon as possible. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Hopefully he can make the last few games of the season and really help us in the key moment.”Wilson’s absence will come as a huge blow to the relegation-threatened Magpies, who invested £million of their £m January spending spree in Burnley frontman Chris Wood but failed in their attempts to further boost their firepower as their pursuit of Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard and Stade de Reims’ Hugo Ekitike came to nothing.Howe added: “He’s gone away, he’s having intense treatment.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCarr, known for his stand-up and hosting roles on shows like  Out Of  Cats, prompted criticism after a clip from his recent one-hour Netflix special, His Dark Material, was shared widely on social media.In it, the comedian jokes about the horror of the Holocaust and “six million Jewish lives being lost” before making a disparaging remark about the deaths of thousands of Gypsies at the hands of the Nazis as part of the punchline.Weve launched a petition to Netflix calling for the removal of the segments of His Dark Material which celebrates the Romani genocide.Join with us to send @NetflixUK a clear message: #StopTravellerHatehttps:t.co cuNqYllYPn— The Traveller MovementFebruary , The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Those comments are deeply disturbing and it’s unacceptable to make light of genocide.”The Government is “toughening measures for social media and streaming s who don’t tackle harmful content”.Asked whether Netflix should pull the show, the spokesman said: “That will be a matter for them. We are clear that mocking the atrocities of the Holocaust is unacceptable.”The Government was focused on “making sure that streaming services are more accountable”, he added.Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries previously suggested new laws via the Media Bill could hold to account streaming sites for airing jokes such as those made by Carr.Anti-hate groups such as the not-for-profit organisation Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and The Auschwitz Memorial have condemned the comedian for the joke.The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, has also launched a petition calling for Netflix to remove the segment of the programme “which celebrates the Romani genocide”..removeIt said the joke in question was “truly disturbing and goes way beyond humour”. vw,vw,px, px\"Health Secretary Sajid Javid criticised Jimmy Carr On Monday morning, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Times Radio the joke was “horrid”.He added: “I think we all have a right to react to that, and one of the best ways anyone can react to that is show these s what they think about Jimmy Carr by not watching or listening to him, and that will send him a very strong message.”Martin Docherty-Hughes, SNP MP for West Dunbartonshire, said he was “utterly dumbfounded” by Carr using the Holocaust to “poke fun at one of the most marginalised groups in these islands, the Roma and Gypsy community”.He suggested the House of Commons should have an opportunity to hold a debate to recognise the “value and worth” of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community across the UK and to “raise them up, not to put them down”.Carr issued a “trigger warning” to the audience at the beginning of his Netflix special and told viewers it contained “terrible things”.According to The Mirror, he appeared to address the controversy during a performance at the Whitley Bay Playhouse on Saturday night.Discussing so-called cancel culture, he told the audience: “The joke that ends my career is already out there.”Netflix declined to comment..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Carr Holocaust joke  udeeply disturbing u but matter for Netflix  u Downing Street article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This means a shuttle service should be offered to ensure those without access to car transport can still access the popular  Express service.”Councillor McGurk added that she undertook a review of rural transport in the wider Dungiven area in  and presented her findings to Translink who had committed to increase services from some surrounding villages to Dungiven to the current  services. “Unfortunately due to Covid these increased services didn’t get the chance to be implemented. However it is clear that this commitment could be widened further to include a fully developed shuttle service between Dungiven and surrounding villages to the new park and ride location.”The Sinn Fein councillor concluded: “I will be meeting with officials from DfI on Thursday morning and I will raise these concerns here. “I will also be attending the public consultation event being held remotely on Thursday evening and would encourage all residents from Dungiven and the surrounding area to do the same and make their voice heard.”Read More Read MoreTim Hortons u-turn on parking chargesTranslinkSinn FeinDepartment for Infrastructure  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsWarning from Lisburn police...News‘Innocent omission’ costs Tyrone barber his licence...NewsMost PopularBest indoor rowing machines UK : at home rowers includin...RecommendedHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router ext...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

be instructed to remove all such items from the cemetery graves,” the notice read.The reminder sparked confusion among local residents, with many taking to social media to voice their thoughts on the issue.Several stated they were unaware of the policy and queried whether the rules had recently changed, while others suggested the removal of tributes by council staff was ‘unfair’ and ‘upsetting’ for the families of the deceased.Larne Lough Alliance Party Councillor, Danny Donnelly stated that he had been contacted by a number of residents over the regulation. “This rule has been in place since at least  I have discussed it with officers after seeing posts on Facebook and hearing from a few people unhappy with this situation,” he said. “It’s clear that this ruling only refers to Christmas wreaths. \"The council has a responsibility to keep cemeteries tidy and respectful of families who visit them to see the graves of their loved ones.”Cllr Donnelly added that he had requested that the issue be added to the agenda for the next meeting of the council’s Direct Services Committee on February .Coast Road DUP Councillor, Andrew Clarke said he was \"pleased\" to see that the council had since suspended the policy. \"Good to see this will now be part of a wider review into grave management,\" a post on Cllr Clarkes Facebook page read.\"It is important that council deal sensitively and sensibly with grieving relatives.\"Commenting on the matter, a spokesperson for Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said: \"As an interim measure, the council have agreed to only remove damaged or wilted wreaths from graves, where identied, in council-run cemeteries.\"This will allow officers to carry out a review of the cemeteries policies.”Read More Read MoreAlmost  burials

Pre-pandemic there was no express provision for remote meetings for district councils.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Addressing the chamber Councillor McGurk, who has always spoken in favour of remote meetings and the flexibility they offer councillors who work or have young families, said: “It was agreed on the evening that we would take a consultation back to the DfC remote hybrid meetings consultation. I believe a draft has been forwarded and I’m quite happy that we adopt that draft as a response to the consultation.“I noted in the content of the draft that the Democratic Services had estimated a saving of approximately £, in members travel for the year   and I think that’s astonishing and it certainly gives us some quantitative evidence to what I have been harping on about much to others dismay, that we really should be looking at remote or hybrid meetings as a way forward for quite a few of our meetings. I would like to propose that we adopt the draft that was circulated to members.”PUP Councillor Russell Watton described the semi empty chamber as being in ‘Old Trafford because there’s nobody going to that at the minute either’.He described the situation as ‘dire’ adding: “Some councillors haven’t been in here for two years and then you have some complaining about bad connections, they could be in here no bother.“It’s less of a council when you are sitting with  or  people. I just can’t see it as a way forward, it’s better being in here, you can see what’s going on and you can tell what people think. It’s dire, I would rather have  sitting here as .”Before taking the vote the Mayor, Councillor Richard Holmes said: “Councillor Watton I share your sentiments.”The proposal to adopt the draft consultation passed with  votes for and  against.Speaking after the council meeting, Councillor McGurk said: “I know the will is there with the majority of members, however there are a few dissenting voices which tend to overshadow other opinions sometimes. “I do recognise there are some meetings that arguably should be done as physical only such as full council meetings where the full council body meets. “Having some physical meetings would counteract some of the negative impacts of remote meetings such as councillor relations, etc, but in general remote and hybrid meetings are too powerful a tool now to ignore and go back to the old ways of doing things just for the sake of it.“The benefits of remote meetings are immense and wide ranging for example cost savings to the public purse.“Democratic Services worked out that a saving of £, was made on members travelling expenses alone in  . This is before we take account of the cost of staff being given time in lieu to attend meetings where they may have had to wait around all night for their item to come up.“I also believe remote hybrid meetings have made council business much more accessible to the public and it allows council members and staff to balance their work and personal lives around council duties much more effectively. “I know from my perspective I have a full time job in construction, and a young family with three children – having to travel to multiple meetings in Coleraine and where wastes so much of my time and doesn’t allow me to use that time to spend with my children, etc. “At the moment I am still able to come back from work, have dinner as a family, help my husband get the kids ready for bed and even get the younger ones down before a pm meeting starts. “A physical meeting would mean me travelling straight to Coleraine after work and not having time to stop in and participate and help with our family evenings.“I would be hopeful that longer term this would encourage people from non-traditional sectors of society to come forward into politics and have a greater representation of vulnerable minority groups.”Read More Read MoreNeed for Translink shuttle to Dungiven park and rideCauseway CoastNorthern IrelandSinn Fein  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularWoman passes away after Glengormley collision...NewsCookstown teacher driving Mercedes caught for speeding...NewsMasked men set home and car on fire in Carnlough...NewsWarning from Lisburn police...News‘Innocent omission’ costs Tyrone barber his licence...NewsMost PopularBest indoor rowing machines UK : at home rowers includin...RecommendedHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router ext...RecommendedEmma takes on Hospice Support Group role...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Currently the Northern Ireland Executive can’t meet following the resignation of First Minister, Paul Givan, last week. The last remaining restrictions were due to be discussed at an Executive meeting on Thursday. However, Mr Swann said he was not prepared to allow a failure of politics to get in the way of lting now unnecessary restrictions. I am now seeking that legal guidance on how I myself can replace the bulk of the remaining restrictions,not all of them, with clear guidance and advice, he said on Monday afternoon. When we had an executive, ministers always said we wouldnt retain restrictions for a day longer than necessary, so that same logic should still apply. While we must move forward carefully, we cant stay locked in emergency restrictions forever. We need to start getting normal back. His comments come astwo Covid--related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday.Another , cases of coronavirus were also reported, up from , on Sunday.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfdafddfff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_effeadacecd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
